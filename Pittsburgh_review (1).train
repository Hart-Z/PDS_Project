"5.0","Absolutely the best pizza I have ever eaten in my life. I come here every year when I go to Pittsburgh. Can't wait to go again."
"3.0","Some pluses but likely more negatives.  Liked the decor. Menu sounds good and creative and presentation of food is excellent. But, my partner and I found our meals to be rather tasteless. He had pancakes. They tasted of nothing, not even vanilla. I had the French toast with Brie, fig sauce and granny smith apples. It came with a side of whipped cream. The apples were perfect tart, the Brie was bitter, the fig not sweet-enough and barely fig-flavored. Admittedly this was an odd combination of flavors which I thought could have worked if only....  Alas, we are unlikely to return."
"5.0","This is by far the BEST lobster roll I have ever tasted!!! We also ordered the lobster and shrimp pizza... it was AMAZING! They are not stingy at all with their Lobster. MUST TRY!"
"2.0","Where do begin? The  only  shining service point of the night was putting our name in for a table. The service only went down from there. My fianc√© waited 15 minutes at the bar trying to get order a round of drinks, nothing, Finally our table was ready - a 2-seater for three people.  We took it so we didn't have to wait any longer.... That was a mistake.Our server Braydon was friendly but less than attentive. She  walked by our table numerous times, looked at us, but stopped for drink orders from the tables next to us. When she finally stopped - we only saw her a handful of times.  Our drinks were decent - my friend's drink had an extremely heavy pour.  Our appetizers were good (the nuts!)  but a bit overpriced ($10) for a bowl full of nuts. The water was definitely not cold (or cool). Overall, it was a great atmosphere. I definitely enjoyed the bar's set-up. The people watching is fantastic. I'd try it again in hopes if a better service experience!"
"5.0","I have walked by Peppi's a million times in my life.  Yesterday, I finally went in and boy am I glad I did!The staff at the counter were super nice and very helpful with two extremely picky and hangry young boys.  They accommodated our order and we're super friendly to the boys.They were kind enough to make a plain cheese steak and call it a roast beef sandwich.  I ordered the Joey Porter-bello.  And WOW!!  They devoured the entire sandwich and said they loved the 'special bread.'  I also devoured my JP...a cheese steak with portobello mushrooms and the most tasty horseradish sauce!  I could probably do shots of the sauce!What the place lacks in ambience, it sure makes up for in great service and fast, fresh, quality ingredients!That special bread is divine!"
"5.0","Have wandered by Edgar's a few times but never went in until today. Now upset I never went in.  Had 2 steak tacos and they were delicious. The meat was great and the freshness of the vegetables and salsa took it to the next level."
"5.0","I had a great experience at Sausalido. We made a reservation for 8 of us on a weeknight and were seated immediately. It's BYOB which I am a huge fan and I have to say that the waitstaff were great sports when we walked in with small buckets of homemade sangria. We weren't necessarily going to be the 'quiet' group of the night.There were a few other groups there but the waitstaff remained very attentive and were very patient and offered recommendations. Apparently, their risotto comes highly recommended and they have different types of risotto every day (I think). If I'm remembering correctly (there was a lot of Sangria) I got goat cheese and roasted red pepper stuffed chicken breast. It was laid on top of an amazing asparagus risotto. Everyone in my party's food looked great.Street parking can be tough so leave yourself plenty of time. Small restaurant so make reservations."
"4.0","Following a tradition of trying new restos when D&k are in town, we picked umami.    Everything we ordered was solid and in the end pretty reasonably priced for how full we were.  Keep in mind that these are tapas style for sharing and they bring them to you as they are ready.   Check out my pics for the portions -things that stood out where the octopus balls (like conch fritters), melt in your mouth sushi options, and the miso ramen that's big enough to share.   My issues with the place were 1-it was hot, we ended up opening an unscreened window for a breeze; 2- for whatever reason, the night we went...they varied between elevator techno music and straight on techno and the speakers were directly overhead.   We will probably come back on special occasions."
"4.0","The place-I felt like a VIP, sneaking in the back door, leading myself up a staircase, following the sounds of a live DJ on a Thursday evening at 7pm. This little hot spot is full of vibes. Good vibes. Hipster and non hipsters alike unite under the dimly red lit skinny tables. The staff is well oiled and put together, the open kitchen is fun to watch from afar - the expediter being key to shipping out dishes in a timely and orderly manner.The drink-Large drink menu, limited by a night out prior, one of us had a cocktail and the other had a Lone Wolf & Cub (8 oz beer and sake pour). Both were above par delicious and creative.The food-I tend to shy away from most food on a stick, but was convinced by my dining partner to at least share his robatayaki. Boy am I glad I did, the wagyu beef tenderloin was melt in your mouth fantastic. Chicken skin, crisp and salty. And the bacon wrapped quail egg was a burst of breakfast satisfaction in my mouf.Just as we finished those, the octopus balls appeared. Highly raved about online, they were octopus fritters with large pieces of meat in them with a parade of sauces over, under, around and through. They were delicious nuggets and great to share. Next up was the savory pancake - cabbage, brussel sprouts, bacon, yam and dried tuna flake highlighted this number, cooked crispy and covered in more mystery saucy goodness. It is a large 'small plate' be aware. To finish the meal came the pork & shrimp shumai. Served at the perfect temperature, filling with a satisfying mouth feel, these may have been my top choice of the night (sans wagyu stick). They came with a dumpling sauce and each had a single edamame tucked into it's hat.The sweets-Fried ice cream, not your traditional Chi-Chi's set up. But vanilla ice cream encased in mochi then coated and fried. I didn't realize that would be the arrangement and I am not a fan of mochi in general - so I can't fairly judge the dish. But a lot of people were ordering it!What would give it 5 stars? Knock a buck off cocktails, make the smaller plates smaller and cheaper, but otherwise, nicely done! I think I found a new date night hang out! Thanks Umami!"
"5.0","Have you ever heard the term, 'you get what you paid for?' Well, it's so true. I'm an occasional pastry lover who sometimes count my calories. But the other day, I had a craving for a good ol' homemade pastry. I passed a Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks along the way. However, I wanted the real thing from a French inspired bakery. La Gourmandine offers a variety of pastry from crescents, eclairs to quiches. Prices range from $2-$4 per pastry. But believe me, it's worth it. With the help of my YELP family, I tried the most reviewed, the almond crescent. DE-LIC-IOUS! Great almond flavor that was not too overpowering. The pastry was buttery and flaky! I also tried the apricot crescent! I'm a sucker for fruit fillings! I got a traditional crescent for my colleague. All three cost me around $8, but it was worth it!"
"5.0","After a long and disappointing search for good Philly cheesesteak we end up at this place while visiting on our way back to Mass from Michigan and this place was amazing. They catered to all of our dietary needs without complaints and gave us the most magnificent meal we had all week!!! The fires we crispy and delicious, they came with the sub. The sub bread was toasty and yet soft, the meat was well seasoned and delicious and The cheese gooey! Uuuhm so yum!"
"5.0","I'll be the first to admit that I couldn't identify half the words on a menu but that didn't stop me from ordering as much a possible. Our waitress was amazing. She took the time to explain each dish and make some great recommendations. All of the portions were great for sharing. I look forward for visiting again. This place could be extremely easy to miss. It's located above round corner cantina and is up quite a few flights of stairs. The stairs didn't seem too bad until I was walking back down.  They are quite steep!"
"4.0","The Pad Thai measuring stick I use for all Thai places didn't stack up too high for this place (3/5 stars), but the red curry and chicken satay made up for it.  I have to admit I have a soft spot for coconut milk, making the red curry one of my favorite items at this place.  The peanut butter sauce served with the chicken satay is also very yummy."
"5.0","I looooove Hardees burgers!! Today, the Frisco Burger, topped with Frisco sauce, bacon, cheese, on Sourdough bread. With a side of beer battered Onion Rings, a great lunch it was!!"
"2.0","The food is decent but service is just terrible. Servers don't know the menu and the management is absent. In fact, a Manager told me today that 'we don't have the time to get your order right'.  Really could be a good experience if they put more effort into customer service and management'. But kudos to the kitchen. I recommend the wings and ultimate nachos."
"4.0","Tasty burgers and decent vegetarian burgers.  Not oversized like some places so it is manageable in one hand.  Place was relatively empty but loud.  Would think it would be an issue when the house is packed full."
"2.0","Ordered Chicken GyrosBread was too soft and seemed old and chicken seemed to be  defrosted in oven and served in our gyro...The table was extremely dirty and I wonder how they can ask customers to eat in tables like that"
"4.0","Solid 4 stars. Never disappointed at a Capital Grill. 2nd time. 1st was in Sarasota, FL. Tonight was great. My son and daughter in Law treated us. We did make early reservations for 3:30pm. With extra traffic we called and let them know we were running 15 minutes behind schedule. They were more than gracious. Seated quickly. Both servers were extremely attentive and experienced. Food was excellent and prepared exactly as ordered. No room for dessert. Great for adults, leave the kids at home for this stop."
"4.0","Pamela's is a fabulous place to grab breakfast...whether it's early in the morning or wake-me-up-at-the-crack-of-noon o'clock. (Usually for me, it's the latter, because I'm a lazy mofo.) I came here a few weeks ago when I was home in Pittsburgh for Thanksgiving with my lovely boyfriend, Sean. We called in advance to make sure the place wasn't swamped. Because believe you me, Pamela's has a tendency to get swamped despite turnover being fairly quick among restaurants of its kind. Luckily the woman on the phone said no wait for two, so we walked on over from my doctor's office on Aiken. Upon arrival, we could see that it had become noticeably more busy since our phone call about 10 minutes prior and I was worried there'd be a wait....well...there wasn't a wait at all! It was beauteous! Our waitress was super sweet and attentive. She immediately took our orders and the food came out in about 5-10mins of time later. Super quick! I had the special strawberry pancakes with sour cream and brown sugar...and don't forget the freshly chopped strawberries! Mmm. The only thing I don't like is their generic watery syrup but I guess you don't really want genuine maple syrup on something as sugary as the special strawberry pancakes. Would be too sugary, most likely! But having that option would be cool for those among us who are syrup junkies, lol. He ordered the 'American' French toast since he prefers his F.T. as plain as can be...without all of the raisins and cinnamon and jam. I tried a bite of it and it was pretty good but nothing beats their hotcakes.Despite going to almost every Pamela's location repeatedly in highschool, I totally forgot that they only accept cash--NO credit cards at all! I had to text my dad who was able to bring me a fist fulla' dollars to pay for our meal. My bad. It's kind of weird that they don't take CC's but I guess they want to keep their prices low as it probably costs them every time they swipe a card. You'd think I'd remember that by now, but I always forget. lol.Anyway I took Sean here because he's never been to Pittsburgh and I wanted to give them 'the experience' by taking him to. as Amy R. put it, a 'Pittsburgh staple.' We had a great time and left with full--but not exploding--stomachs."
"4.0","Reminds me of the Chinese restaurants where I ate growing up.   Servers are friendly (they remembered us!) and food is always hot and plentiful.  My regular dish, Ma Po Tofu, is relatively inexpensive and comes in a large bowl with good-sized squares of tofu to enjoy and take home.  The cashew chicken came with a handful of large cashews on top.  Place was bustling, with everyone looking like they were enjoying their meals too."
"2.0","Due to this being ordered through DoorDash, this review is based only on the food.And man, was the food BLAND. REALLY BLAND.Ordered the ravioli to start with. BLAND!Spaghetti and meatball(s)? BLAND!Not only bland, but it was the kind of pasta you would get from a food court at a Mall. Yeah...that quality. (It says add meatballs for an additional price on there, but it was one meatball...and it wasn't very good)I can't give it 1 star because it wasn't AWFUL. It was literally just the quality that you'd compare to essentially Italian Fast Food (going back to the food court comparison)"
"5.0","Amazing food. We got all of the mains and shared them as a group. Incredible salted cod dish, tender baked octopus. Spotless restaurant with impeccable service. Definitely a must-try restaurant!"
"5.0","Came here for dinner on a Saturday night with my husband while visiting family and was very impressed. My husband and I tried both crab salads- one was crab cake and the other was crab chunks, both of which were delicious! Service was great even though they were packed. Key lime pie was the best I've ever had. Will definitely be returning, but will be sure to make a reservation next time. Popular place."
"5.0","I love Freshii. I was visiting Pittsburgh for a conference from the Portland OR area and was excited to see it was here. Strangely, it tastes exactly the same --not how they manage consistency but they are doing a great job. :) I always get the spicy lemongrass soup with tofu. So good and feels good on my sensitive stomach."
"5.0","The food here was delicious! The French fries and Mac and cheese were to die for. I also enjoyed the spinach dip and pork tacos. Good service and good company made for a great dinner  love the summit and they have berkey water....perfection"
"4.0","Gang, this place is awesome; it's our Pittsburgh-living-friends' go-to Indian place, and after a couple times using their delivery service (because Pittsburgh it the least navigable city in the US) this is a comfortable four stars.  Our delivery has arrived on time each time, and the food was hot and delicious.  I think this place has the best saag paneer that I have ever had anywhere; the chicken vindaloo was also really good, as was the chicken tikka, the samosas, and the tandoori chicken.  I guess I'd probably pass on the pakora next time, and it isn't cheap, but it's good enough to make me want to go back to Pittsburgh so I can get trapped on the wrong side of one of the forty rivers that run through town."
"5.0","I have to update.  Since my last review I've tried 3 other dishes. Most recently the 1/4 fried chicken. Seasoned perfectly and the breast was succulent.   I've taken 10 additional people and they all loved it. Although parking is a challenge, I can usually find a spot on one of the side streets off Carson."
"1.0","Terrible experience. Canceled order while it said it was en route for delivery. Do not use this place for delivery. Food is subpar at best."
"4.0","I love BYOB places. I especially love BYOB places that have fantastic food (Nicky's Thai, duh!!). Sausalido meets the criteria to qualify as a place I LOVE! I can't believe I've been coming to Bloomfield for years to eat at Lot 17 which is right next door and I hadn't ventured into this fabulous place. Little did I know what I was missing. Terrific food that's fresh, imaginative, well prepared, and super tasty. The place appears small as you approach, a narrow nondescript building on Liberty Avenue. The downstairs seating area probably holds 12 tables or so but there's an upstairs dining area as well. There are specials listed on the chalkboard as you enter but I noticed that they were out of at least one of them quite early (7:00) one Saturday night. Could have been a fluke or maybe the monkfish special was extremely popular early. But rest assured, there's enough on the regular menu to satisfy your hunger and your distinguished palateWe started with the grilled asparagus and goat cheese appetizer and the smoked gouda with saut√©ed spinach. Both excellent choices. They serve a complimentary bean dip that is out of this world. Had me wanting more.I ordered the hangar steak over a warm malt Dijon potato salad (you have to taste this - I could eat a gallon of this!). It was so well prepared, sliced thinly and cooked to a tender perfection. Oh my. My wife ordered the bucicini, a bowl full of hollow pasta with shrimp, mussels, bay scallops, broccoli, arugula, and shaved parmesan. Yum. It was HUGE. (LEFTOVERS!!!) Our dinner partner ordered the two jumbo, lump crab cakes over a bed of lemon zucchini risotto. She loved them! I'm ordering those next time.We didn't have room for dessert (but we did for more wine) but the chocolate peanut butter creme br√ªl√©e would have been my choice. I'm going back for sure. And I'll save room for dessert!"
"4.0","I went to Thai Gourmet because my other favorite Thai place was closed on Monday. I called to order pick up. The food was ready when I got there. I ordered the Pad Thai. The food was okay. Not the best Thai I've ever had but it was so-so. They gave me a little brownie as dessert that was pretty good. Overall it was good. I'd still go there again."
"4.0","Tiny ice cream/coffee shop in East Liberty on Penn Circle.  Not a lot of selections but open early.  Four stars for coffee for a dollar.  Hard to find parking at later hours due to construction nearby.  Walking distance from Target."
"4.0","Groupon users, this place has some rules. The directions can be a little unclear, but I have learned from experiance that 1. on weekends the only lunch options are the buffet- which you can't use the groupon for. 2. you need a reservation for dinner regardless of the day if you plan on using it. If you have the reservation you are good to go,  but if not it seems as though they will be hard to budge.Otherwise great food, casual yet romantic atmosphere, and a great place to go if you've never had indian before!"
"4.0","I was pleasantly surprised by this place and the name holds true. When you first walk in, the place looks old, which can give off a two sided opinion, but then I ate the Corned Beef, which was amazing!  A good quantity of meat and the quality was even better...  I'm from Jersey and it's hard to rival our deli sandwiches back home, but I'd say this place comes as close as possible.  I strongly recommend checking this place out if you are in town for a Steelers game and I plan to visit here again when I come to see the Pirates play."
"5.0","I LOVE THIS PLACE! I order from them a lot more than I'd like to admit. Their food is ALWAYS always delicious. They have the best customer service too! Any time there was a problem, or they had a question they immediately called me to clarify. They even called me once for an opinion since I ordered so regularly. I recommend this place to everyone. Even my room mates have jumped on the bandwagon. Definitely check this place out, you will not be disappointed!! (I highly recommend their chicken panini!)"
"4.0","I've been to Tamarind for their lunch buffet, years ago and when my Mom wanted Indian for her birthday dinner I immediately remembered having good experiences here. So we gave it a go and my Mom was quite pleased. She and my husband had the mixed grill, I had the chicken curry, and my stepdad chicken tikka masala. We ordered a bread basket for the table and food was shared all around! I recommend getting a cup of masala chai tea at the end of your meal, a lovely way to finish things off. I'm thinking we need to start putting Tamarind into our take-out rotation as well, really want to explore more of this menu."
"5.0","One of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh. It helps to know your middle eastern foods before you arrive as there's not much in the way of descriptions, but they do a great job. Grill and prepared stuff is all excellent, but the chicken shawarma platter with chick peas is where it's at"
"4.0","For a quick lunch this place is a great spot.  You get in and get what you want and go.  Especially if you hit it at just the right time.  I was surprised that it wasn't busy when we showed up, but that just made for filling my belly a quicker time.I know that the name says corned beef in it, but I have to admit that I didn't partake in a sandwich that had corned beef.  I cannot tell you why, but every single time I end up in a deli type of place I get myself an egg salad sandwich.  There's something about that sandwich that is simple.  Also something about it makes it quite the quick meal to down in a hurry.The sandwich was plentiful, I was not upset by that fact.  Two long slices of bread filled with egg salad and my choice of toppings.  I just went with lettuce as I wanted a little bit of a crunch.  I enjoyed every single bite of that sandwich.  Definitely a place I will stop in again."
"2.0","The food was good and service was quick. However, the place was dirty, the menus were worn and sticky and my girlfriend found a hair in her drink. I can't believe Jerome Bettis owns or licensed his name to this place."
"5.0","My best friend and I go there all the time to grab drinks and to get the popcorn. Found out that they had a pretty good burger too! It can get crowded during popular bar times, but the cocktails are always good. If it's you're first time trying it, try to get there when it isn't too busy."
"3.0","It's great to have a place like Il Tetto (part of Sienna Mercato) in downtown Pittsburgh. I can't think of a better activity on a warm summer night than spending some time relaxing at a rooftop beer garden, especially with as beautiful of a view as Il Tetto's. There are positives and negatives, but generally I enjoy coming here once in a while.The first positive is that the beer selection is decent. My cousins and I visited Il Tetto past Saturday for one of my cousin's bachelorette parties, and I had no problems choosing beers throughout the night. Toward the end of the night, however, it seemed like they quickly ran out of several beers. Hours state that the bar is open until 2 on Saturdays, so I was a little bummed they ran out of a few beers we'd have liked to try. It was around 12:30 when we tried ordering both a Dogfish Sea Quench and another beer, and they were out of both.Another thing I particularly enjoy here is the open roof. It's beyond cool to see the lights while you're standing on the outside balcony sipping on a refreshing and tasty beer. This last visit was on an evening that was particularly muggy and hot, and with as crowded as it gets here it can get uncomfortable. If they had a better ventilation or fan system to keep patrons cool it would help astronomically. On cooler and less crowded evenings, though, it's a great place to be.Service is something that I'd say they have room for improvement on. It took a while to get beers to our table, and being here for around 3 hours I drank about 3 beers. Not bad for me, but I know some of my cousins were growing impatient with how long it took between rounds. I've had experiences here where it took a while to get our beers at the bar, and I can see why other reviews mention the service here. Aside from that, it's a neat bar and unlike others in the city. If you're a beer fanatic or just looking for a good spot to kill some time downtown, this place won't break the bank. I'd recommend it, but be aware of the crowd size!"
"5.0","On a very busy saint Patricks day night.  There was excellent service and the food was great.  Of special note George our waiter took us for a tour of Jerome's 'man cave' considering how busy the wait staff was we appreciated it!  We had a fabulous time!"
"4.0","I braved the heat n humidity, because I'm greedy ......but even after sitting on my desk through 2 meetings, it's still!     I feel like I'm in San Diego circa '85......Yummy$2 TacoTuesday"
"5.0","I was there for the first time last night.  I have to say, this was probably the best meal I have ever had, collectively.  The food is expensive, bit worth every penny!  The bread, outstanding!  The lobster bisque soup, amazing!  My wife and I shared one of the specials, which was a bone in ribeye, and two lobster tails.  The ribeye was quite frankly, the best steak I have ever eaten.  The lobster tails were very good as well, although, I can't recall where our server said they were from.  The atmosphere in this place is awesome too!  Our server was outstanding as well.  I can't say enough good things about this place."
"3.0","Food=really yummy.Service=non existent.Saturday night was hopping, which seemed to overwhelm the staff (maybe they were short?).The host, Jerry, could not have been more gracious.But We waited a good 10+ minutes before someone acknowledged us after we were seated. We flagged down a nearby server who wrangled a colleague.  Barely saw our server throughout the meal. Drinks were empty for a long time.But the food was really great. we were not in too great of a hurry so would welcome giving them a second chance."
"4.0","Great atmosphere, ahi tuna was amazing, best cod sandwich ever.  Would definitely reccomend and return.  Good lunch specials."
"1.0","Sexist Manager.  I am a professional woman who attended lunch here a few weeks ago with two male coworkers.  The food was fine (not a big fan of canned mushrooms though) and the server was great.  However, mid-meal the manager came around to greet the tables.  Upon approaching our table he asks 'how is everything GENTLEMEN?'  Although I was offended, I figured this may have been a mistake.  However, when the same manager came by 10 min later and looked the the full glass in front of me with an empty glass next to it - he looked to my coworker and asked 'Sir, is that your drink and you need another or is that hers and she is done with it?'  I did not realize that in 2014 a manager for customer service would find it necessary to not address a woman directly.  Offended doesn't even begin to explain my outrage.  Unfortunately, I said nothing at the time - although I should have.  But I will never return to be treated so poorly or to patronize an establishment managed by such a blatantly sexist male."
"5.0","I love this place.  I order the Pad Kee Mow with vegetables every time I go.  I crave this dish.  It's awesome.  The fried spring rolls are really good, too.My husband and I frequent this place enough that the staff recognizes us and welcomes us when we come in.  I've been to so many other Thai restaurants in this city and I really do think this one is the best, especially when factoring in selection, taste, quantity and price.  When I order Pad Kee Mow at other places, I just end up disappointed because it's not like Thai Gourmet's."
"5.0","My kind of brewpub. Playfulness comes through in both their beer and food, and I like a place that doesn't take itself too seriously. The service was excellent and our stay at the bar felt like we were bellying up to our local, even though this was our first time here. My husband and I got the mushroom crostini and didn't catch the fact that it contained cashew cheese until after the fact. Score one for the vegans. We also got the Scotch egg; the sausage was tender and the egg runny. Perfect. Finished off our food sampling with the pierogi, which were also vegan and incredibly satisfying. As for the beers, I really dug the sours and my husband liked the Pilsner (non-dry hopped). The guava Berliner was particularly good. The wet-hopped IPA was too bitter for my taste, but the Objectively Enjoyable was balanced and smooth."
"1.0","I am restraining myself from so many expletives but this place is effing horrible. The customer service is the worst I have ever experienced.  Don't ever ever ever ever order from here unless u want rude service, complete waste of money, cold food, high prices."
"4.0","They have gluten-free buns for all sandwiches and burgers for only 50 cents extra. How many other low cost restaurants offer this? I am a fan for this reason alone. My only gripe is that they eliminated the grilled salmon with dill sauce from their menu, which had been one of my favorites."
"4.0","I've eaten here a couple times now that I work on this side of the city and I've enjoyed the meals thoroughly! Their takeout service is really quick for lunch but I have also eaten in. My last meal there I ate in with a decent size group from work. We all order something different from the lunch menu. I ordered Beef w/ Broccoli and a shrimp egg roll. The egg roll came out first and it was delicious. A really nice size and packed with shrimp and veggies. The main dish came out and the sauce they use for the beef broccoli is pretty tasty. The water was decent and they do charge gratuity for a large groups more than 5.I will definitely be back if im in the mood for some quick and tasty Chinese Food."
"5.0","Thai gourmet is an ok/above average place for Thai food. You will probably be satisfied with the food and very satisfied with the bill: it's cheap!Service was fast, waiters was nice, and the room is not big, but probably it won't get noisy. I went here with a group of 8 friends, and we were all very happy with the large portions and the quality of the food.We brought a cake and we were not charged for the service. That was very nice of them!"
"5.0","My favorite Thai restaurant in the city. The ladies working are sweet & the food is consistently good."
"4.0","I loved the vibe and decor of this new great addition to the Oakland Food scene! First off don't let the crowd of people waiting for their food deter you away from trying this place out. We waiting less than 10 minutes until our food arrived! (Around 7 on a Thursday night) Beware seating is pretty limited. I wanted to try something more unique so I went for the Chicken and Waffles and was pleasantly surprised but felt like something was missing. I wish there had been a bit more maple syrup and I feel like honey mustard dipping would've been the perfect addition to this dish: The chicken itself was really good, juicy and crunchy. I would be careful about how much spice you decide to get! A friend got hot and his chicken virtually inedible. I stuck with Southern (no spice) which I enjoyed a lot. Mild was good too! Reminds me of Bird on the Run or a gourmet chick fil-a. Worth trying this place out but I wouldn't say it's an amazingly different than any other chicken restaurant I've been to."
"3.0","A new 'fast food' restaurant located on Grant Street is always welcome!  For those of us who walked by the sign in the window teasing of a grand opening for months, it was Super Awesome when it finally happened. I was so excited when it opened that I ordered a salad and a soup, and could not wait to dig in. In retrospect, $19.00 was *entirely* too expensive for the tiny, tiny portion of salad that was served and the quart of soup. Yes, the salad had a nice flavor... but it tasted like a small salad and nothing more. The lemongrass soup was flavorful, not authentic, and the portion size was generous. Considering I can enjoy a larger bowl of vegetable soup at an Asian restaurant just a few blocks away for almost half the price, jam packed with fresh vegetables, Freshii does not offer a good value there either. The best $12 salad still goes to Bluebird Kitchen on Stanwix or Villa Reale (based on price, quality, serving size, healthiness).My coworker swore on his mother's grave that the Oaxaca bowl was amazing. I went back for the Oaxaca bowl with chicken later that week. The Oaxaca bowl with chicken was, in all honesty, mostly a bowl of kale (some of it brown and wilted), two tablespoons of rice, a tablespoon of chicken, a tablespoon of beans, a teaspoon of corn, two slivers of avocado, a tablespoon of salsa, and a dried up lime wedge for just under $10.00.  The lovely woman at Sree's will triple the quality, flavor, and caloric intake for $3 less.  We bought a POUND of kale for Ribolitta on Sunday and let me tell you -- the amount of kale in my bowl was about 35 cents' worth AND old. Not to be deterred from making Freshii my new 'Go-To' destination for lunch, I tried the Oaxaca bowl with chicken again, thinking maybe it was a blip, but had a repeat experience. Don't get me wrong, who doesn't love kale, right?  I also love popcorn but am not going to pay $10 for a small bowl of it. The employees are very nice, friendly, and I will give credit to management for trying to shepherd customers through the ordering and pick-up process. The layout is strange, but they're making as good use of the space as is possible. Perhaps I will try again in a month, after they've had some longer run-time."
"5.0","Maaaaan! The hype is real!I ordered the Meat Shwarma and a side of Meat Samosa.  The Shwarma came with literally tons of meat which I believe was gyro meat on top of lettuce tomatoes and red onions with a side of gyro sauce. The meat (ground beef) samosa came with I believe tahini sauce. The samosa was excellent and just a tad bit spicy. For the price of the order I was well satisfied. It could have fed at least 3 people.  Just tried the chicken Shwarma and veggie samosa too! Trust me if your into middle eastern and mediterranean foods this place is by far the best I've had in and around the city."
"5.0","Fried chicken is probably one of my favorite so when I've seen this spot recently opened I knew I had to stop in one day. So forwarding months later... I finally decided to come in after getting bubble tea couple doors down at Fuku. It was after 8pm on a random Saturday night and to my surprise it wasn't too busy so I was happy that I got my food within like 5 mins after I ordered. I got the 3 piece chicken tenders (medium spicy) with fries and boy those 3 pieces are worth it! I promise after those 3 pieces and fries and a drink you'll be good to go! Besides the food, I like that they have outlets with USB ports by the tables! So smart & convenient. Wish every restaurants will have this in the future whether it's in a college campus or not!"
"4.0","While in town I stopped here to eat some dinner and watch a game on one of their many tv's. The game I specifically wanted to watch wasn't showing but the staff was able to quickly accommodate my request.I enjoyed an order of dry dusted wings, some tater tot nacho's and a few Lite beers from Miller. All good and as expected. The service was good, lots of games to watch and overall a good atmosphere."
"3.0","Cute place, good service mediocre food, but a lot of it..Wonton soup was missing wonton filling,"
"1.0","The food is average and the service was terrible. 1. I asked for recommendations and the waiter could not make an honest recommendation. I asked for two items mussels and salmon.  He could care less and brought me a seafood trio, so I could try a little bit of everything. 2. I asked for a Bloody Mary terrible taste and preparation.  3. Service was terrible, not only wrong items were brought to me and challenge me back on my order. But also was rushed to get out and pay. The place is empty, no I understand whyWill not return."
"4.0","The 5 best things about Rialto Pizza.1. The veggie pizza practically comes with a salad on top: fresh, crisp and plentiful.2. A seriously delicious Italian hoagie. Darn near everyone does them, but Rialto is a cut above.3. The Rialto Giant (28 inches, 49 slices) is too big to fit in my front door, but if you're having people over for a game or a party it's perfect. Tip: Use it as an incentive on moving day. You'll have more help (and more pizza) than you'll know what to do with.4. An admirable selection of decently-priced beer means not having to make two stops on the way home.5. If there's no game on t.v., guaranteed they are playing some basic cable reality show (which is the television equivalent of eating pizza)."
"5.0","This place was so amazing very intimate and low key  great place to takeYour boo the menu is amazing and the cocktails are to die for!!!! So check this place out my yelpers"
"1.0","I have never written a review before, but after our experience last night I was compelled to share it. It was a total disaster and the worst dining experience that I have ever had. Anything that could go wrong, did.  We waited three hours wait to be seated and served. When the food finally arrived, nearly all of the orders were wrong and the food was cold.  We had three orders that didn't arrive at all. One person ordered the kale salad - spinach was served instead with no explanation. One person ordered a pulled pork sandwich, only to be told they were out of pork - not at the time of ordering but instead  nearly two hours later when the other orders were being served. Fish tacos came in lieu of fish and chips, three burgers were presented, but the servers couldn't identify the differences between the orders.  The scene was incredible and we asked to talk to the manager. She was calm, as were we, but she wasn't incompetent able to problem-solve or explain what was happening. The manager and severs were embarrassed and abandoned our table for the rest of the night.The night was a total disaster. Don't go! So many better restaurants in Pittsburgh."
"3.0","My husband and I went here last night for our 1st anniversary.  The food was amazing, however, the overall experience was subpar.We arrived about 20 minutes early and went to the bar for a drink.  The bar was packed and very loud so we were really looking forward to sitting at at a nice quiet table but we were not.  Our table was right by the bar!  It was so loud and people were standing right by the table.  We were also disappointed to see people in hoodies and jeans the minute we walked in the door.  I was disappointed that there is not a dress code enforced.Our waiter was very nice and attentive but we waited a long time in between courses.  We sat down at 7:30 and had an appetizer and salads.  Our steaks did not arrive till after 9.  Now I'm all about enjoying an evening out but that was too long to wait.  By the time our steaks arrived we weren't even hungry anymore because we had filled up on bread waiting.  For the price that we paid I do not think this place was worth it.  There are a lot better steakhouses in Pittsburgh for less money and you will receive a better overall experience!"
"5.0","Its been nearly 4 years since I have been here, but honestly, its the best Japanese food I have ever had. The tempura was out of this world and the Ousimono was great. And the sushi, was amazing! I wish I had been old enough to yelp back then!"
"5.0","Delicious, healthy, customized personal pizzas for a great price: $8 flat for unlimited toppings! They have a nice variety of toppings so there's something for everyone. You can build you own from scratch or get one off the menu. I got the margherita pizza with multigrain dough, with mozzarella, tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms, asiago, and basil. For pizzas with an oil base like mine, I recommend not finishing with another oil on top because they're pretty generous with the oil base. Service was friendly and efficient as well."
"5.0","Skip the big fast-casual chains in the East End and hit up Azorean for lunch. It's also fast, also casual, and chances are you'll get a much more fresh, house-made, and delicious meal for the same, or less, money. Service was very friendly and the portion sizes were generous. I had the tuna salad (which was phenomenal), but everything on the menu sounded delicious. Definitely check it out. Street parking along Liberty and the side streets usually isn't too bad at all, either."
"5.0","Loved the sushi here. It was very fresh and good quality. They even let us customize them.The teriyaki chicken appetizer was great, the chicken was very well made.Miso soup with tofu was good.The hot sake wasn't really that great, but my overall experience was good enough to ignore it.We had a dessert, chocolate mousse cake with vanilla, which was awesome!Loved the ambiance, and service was really good and timely. The staff was very polite.Your best bet for parking is the parking lot nearby. Kiku will give you a parking validation for $2 off. We ended paying just $2 after this validation."
"5.0","My husband and I were looking for a new lunch spot and this popped up as a suggestion. When we got there it was sort of an 'industrial' type interior atmosphere but everything looked very new and nice. Our waitress was attentive and fast. We ordered the bagel type hot dog appetizer and that was very interesting and very delicious. Only thing is I wish they would have toasted the hot dog bun and put a little more avocado on the bread. Otherwise very tasty! My husband made his own burger and I got a chicken sandwich with side salad. The food was EXCELLENT. Chicken sandwich was fresh and bun stayed crisp, not soggy, despite the multiple  toppings on the sandwich. My husband's burger was cooked to the right temp and his rosemary fries were AMAZING (obviously I had to try some). Overall this place was excellent and he has already been back since our visit. Highly recommendedP.S. the plates reminded me of eating lunch at someone's grandma's house and I LOVED IT"
"3.0","Went for lunch buffet on Saturday.Goat curry is one of the best I tasted.Don't go in late before the closing hours. You may not get to taste original curry."
"2.0","I used to love this place but last three orders have been horrible. I ordered string beans and chicken extra spicy. No spice and it was 90% string beans. As usual I asked for extra homemade hot mustard and needed nothing els and I get the whole bunch of condiments and just a tad of mustard. I used to think they were the best and sadly they continue to disappoint"
"5.0","May or may have not been the best brunch I've ever had in Pittsburgh.You pay at the cashier then seat yourself with a table number thing.LEMON & RICOTTA PANCAKES ($9): So fluffy like what I'd imagine a cloud to taste like. Melted in your mouth like cotton candy. I highly recommend this if you're coming for breakfast or brunch. FRENCH TOAST ($9): This jam is to die for. It's not too sweet, reminds me of a smoothie bowl. The french toast is also a bit crispy, but not too chewy.OMELETTE ($10): Got bacon, mushrooms, and swiss cheese (It says you can put up to 3 fresh ingredients). So so so cheesy, almost too cheesy for me. Crazy cheese pulls, perfect for pics. This gave the extra edge of savoriness to our shared meal.These three picks were perfect to share together, as they all had their own strengths of sweetness, tanginess, and savoriness.Got busy around lunchtime on a weekday really fast, good thing we came at 11. I was so impressed by the breakfast foods that I would love to come back for lunch for their gourmet sandwiches."
"4.0","Disclaimer: this review is almost purely about the aesthetic and ambiance at Umami. When I went there around 10p on a Friday night, I wasn't hungry, but my friends got some fantastic looking (and smelling!) dishes and cocktails. They definitely have some gimmicks (such as a syringe to inject soy sauce into a rice ball), but honestly those only added to the experience! Walking up the stairs to this place, you get a sense of the artistic vision of the owners. The walls are covered in this paper with beautifully intricately detailed designs, but there are modern twists. When you get to the top and turn the corner, you immediately take in an intimate bar with tasteful neon signs and more of this traditionally styled Japanese art with a modern flair. You keep moving further into the room and you notice to your right are a few more tables and a sushi counter, which still all feels very intimate and cozy. On Friday nights they have an incredible DJ who makes seamless blends between different genres and beats--I would go back just to hear more of his stuff! I also can't wait to go back to actually try the food and more fully experience what Umami offers. If you are looking for a cool new place to try or want to impress your out of town friends with something a little different that feels high end, this is your spot!"
"5.0","Best pizza in the burgh. No hyperbole. This is where you're supposed to go if you want pizza."
"5.0","Great Italian food.    We enjoyed the pastabilities and choosing our own sauce and pasta.   We sat outside which was nice on a warm evening. Service was very attentive and we never had to wait.   Food may have come a little too quickly, as we were still enjoying our salads."
"4.0","I have been dying to try Sausalido out as I have had food from their catering menu at various events and it was totally amazing!  We went for a birthday celebration and it could not have been a better night.  Our young waiter was fantastic and took our order and served the food in a timely manor.  It is BYOB and they did not charge a corkage fee although it does state on their website that a $2 corkage fee per person will be charged so be prepared.  The smoked gouda appetizer came highly recommended so we gave it a try.  I was a bit disappointed as it was a big piece of fried cheese-tasted like a fried ravioli.  It was tasty but did not come with anything.  We had some leftover bread they brought out which it paired nicely with.  For my entr√©e I went with the pork which came with a very flavorful (lots of chives on top) whipped potatoes. All entrees are served with a side salad.  You had the choice of a special ranch dressing or vinaigrette. I went with the ranch which was very tasty-liked the fresh beets they put in the salad.  I was a bit disappointed with my pork as it was a large piece of meat with a good amount of fat and not that much flavor.  Others in my party ordered the crab cakes (came with 2 with tons of crab meat) and an asiago risotto which was to die for!  The pasta dish with mushrooms I also got to sample and it was a huge portion-big enough for 2 meals.  The restaurant was nice enough to let us bring birthday cupcakes for the celebration and brought them out with candles.  The space is small but it has the feel of a French bistro which made for a fantastic evening."
"3.0","Had lunch there 12/27. I had french onion soup and filet mignon, my husband had clamchowder & dry aged ny strip with some wine. They were all good, not fantastic. We both ordered our steaks medium rare and two steaks were VERY different. Mine was almost rare and my husband's had no red center at all (too cooked). The service wasn't bad, but not excellent. Maybe because lunch fares are more casual? Noticed that they do offer cheaper lunch Plate menus($20 for appetizer+entree), so I might try that with some girlfriends next time. But for $150+tip for lunch, I wasn't too thrilled about my experience today."
"5.0","Great service! Very attentive, polite and professional. My favorite steak house in Pittsburgh by far. I had the roasted chicken - my aunt had lobster and others had steak. It was amazing! Came here for my birthday last year as well and the service was amazing. They give a great complimentary dessert for birthdays too - small crembule and dark chocolate cake and it's great!"
"4.0","Stopped by the new spiffy EnP.  Very nice new building with a drive up window.  We came for breakfast and I had the Eggs Benedict Florentine.  Delicious!  The poached eggs were cooked perfectly.  The hollandaise was tasty and seasoned.  The bacon, spinach and English muffin were a winning combination."
"4.0","Got a 3 piece mild chicken with fries and a drink! It was delicious! The mild is pretty hot for a 'mild' option just a heads up. The chicken has a sauce that made it a little messy to eat, but it was really good! Crinkle fries has really good seasoning on it and the sauce went really well with it! The set up of seating was a little chaotic since we went at a busy time, but it's definitely worth a try."
"5.0","My boyfriend and I were checking out the Strip,  when we peeped into Cafe Raymond and instantly knew we had to eat there. The atmosphere was so welcoming and the people were very friendly. We were recommended the Blueberry Ricotta Pancakes and the French Toast so that's exactly what we did!We were able to seat ourselves. It being somewhat crowded, we decided to sit outside, which is fine by me because who doesn't enjoy people watching? Haha anyway, we were served in about 15 minutes and I myself was taking back by how pretty the dishes looked. People walking by seemed to agree because our dishes were getting many stares and comments on how good they looked. Luckily for us, we were able to try let and OH MY GOD. I enjoyed my French Toast very much so but these Blueberry Ricotta Pancakes will change your mind about any other pancake you've ever had. Hands down my favorite Pancakes I've ever tried!"
"5.0","I'm so happy that this place is so close by to my work. I love the chikn sandwich! It is juicy spicy and large. Would totally recommend this place to spice lovers. Also, I personally find the sandwich better balanced than the tenders. The last time I had tenders it was overcooked."
"5.0","My husband and I went to CHiKN on Friday night after I saw an ad on Instagram. We were sold after looking up the menu and reading reviews. CHiKN is a fast-casual type place, where you place your order at the counter (cards only, no cash!), then they bring your tray to your table. The spice level is your choice from 0-4. I got level 1 and my husband got 2. We made one of our meals a combo, which for $3 extra, came with seasoned crinkle-cut fries and a fountain drink. Our food was so yummy! We both ordered tenders (I ordered 3 and my husband 5). The portions were huge. The level 1 chicken was very flavorful with minimal spice. Almost a smoky/sweet heat, as I would describe it. The level 2 tasted quite different with a good level of spice that didn't make our noses run. I think I would get level 2 next time because I enjoyed the spice! The chicken is served with a sauce as well that toned down the spice a bit, but you really didn't need it because of how much flavor is in the tenders!We thoroughly enjoyed our meals and will 100% be back soon!"
"5.0","Dope spot for a great burg(h)er! The shoestring fries are better than the best and the cheese sauce is legendary. A cook to order smash burger is very hard to come by, and this place does it better than any joint in the city. You will not be disappointed unless you like Mondo Burger. Plus THEY BREW THEIR OWN BEER!"
"2.0","I love Panera and the food in this location is great. However, I must say that the service sucks!!! They are such idiots who work at this location, stuck up, and expect only college students to eat here. The staff looked at me like I was crazy since I wasn't in college. Also, I see the employees' here texting, being unprofessional, and not even working! I would give this 5 stars if the people who work here would do their job. I had even asked why they don't put out napkins and I never see any of the staff putting out napkins, straws, or anything like that when they run out of napkins and I always have to ask them for napkins and they just give me a weird look. I don't recommend anyone going to this location if you rather have professional workers!!"
"5.0","This is my favorite place to go for a quick drink or food. Also the two bartenders Bubba and Dj are my two favorites .."
"5.0","My sweet, sweet Lord, Pamela's is Heaven on Earth. I brought out of towners, because I had heard it was a Pittsburgh legend. I'd heard bad things from a coworker years back, and it just put me off from ever going until this weekend. We waited a half hour for a party of six. They don't have a kids menu, so my daughter and I split a breakfast. They brought extra plates with no issue, service was fast and friendly, the decor is nice and the whole place has this laid back, comfort feel. The staff was all so nice it almost killed my appetite... But then those pancakes came. Don't get me wrong. The eggs were good. The sausage was good. The coffee, the potatoes, the bacon, it was all good, but these pancakes... It was a spiritual experience. Most of the time my pancakes are something that get nibbled on but they are so thick at other places you can never finish them. Pamela's pancakes have an amazing texture to them, they're thinner than normal pancakes but crisp on the edges, I mean damn. I only regret not ordering more pancakes. Or all of the pancakes. And considering they aren't really outside of the eat n Park /Dennys price range, I mean why do people even go there when Pamela's exists. No comparison. Just go to Pamela's already."
"3.0","This is a review for the takeout experience. I have always had generally positive dining experiences here, with the food being very good. They are super slow, however, so if you are trying to get out in a reasonable amount of time, do go elsewhere.I was told that my takeout order would be ready in 30 minutes, but when I arrived at 30 they told me another 15 minutes. I found this to be unacceptable, and it appeared to me that there were several others who were also in the same situation. They need to get their act together with regards to seating and timely take-out orders."
"4.0","The food here is incredible, everything I have tried over several visits has been outstanding.  The service is typically very good too, educated wait staff who are great about giving recommendations etc. The only thing holding me back from 5 stars was the service from the hostess stand during my last visit.  I came with a large party of 7 but it was early in the evening, we had a 5:30 reservation.  The restaurant was nearly empty at that time.  5 of the 7 in my party were there for the first time and the hostess seated us and said 'you know you're going to have to be out of here by 7:30, we have another reservation'.  Super rude and not at all welcoming to either brand new OR returning patrons.  That was disappointing but the food is so amazing, I will keep coming back."
"1.0","Came here after a Pirates game for a bite to eat and drink. Walked in, found an empty table by the bar, only to have a hostess come up 15 seconds later and place a reserved sign on it. Asked if there are more tables, were directed upstair. Found a few empty tables, took a corner circle 5 top. Sat down, same hostess comes up and asks how many people are in my party. I say 4, and she asks us to move tables again. Finally sat down and the hostess proceeds to place 'Reserved' signs on 6 other open tables around us. An hour and 15 minutes later, they just removed all the reserved signs. Does this business not want customers? Putting reserved signs on all of your tables when Pirates games get out so you don't have to serve customers ? Awesome."
"3.0","Salsa bar is fun. Specials aren't too interesting. Ultimately the food is overpriced and the restaurant area upkeep seems to overwhelm the staff."
"3.0","I've lost enough money at Rivers Casino were I can fund a small village in Zimbabwe for the next decade. Needless to say when I come to Rivers I usually end up at the Wheelhouse. The food is pretty good here after a night of losing large sums of money. Obviously, the service is a little better when it's not packed. I usually get the grilled chicken sandwich which is standard fare."
"4.0","I used to go to Peppi's all the time but hadn't been in probably over a year when I returned this past weekend. We were walking through the Strip and hopped in here because all the brunch places were packed.The location is small on the inside, but I've never had trouble getting a seat. Their menu is large and the employees are always very friendly. My husband always gets the Rothelsburger and I rotate between their few vegetarian sandwiches. And we always get the cheese fries.The food is consistently great, and this past weekend was no exception. Sometimes it takes a while to get your food - this past weekend they were short staffed, and it took a long time. However, they apologized and were very friendly about it.I do wish they had some better vegetarian options. I feel like their veggie sandwiches are really close to being great, but kind of miss the mark - there's just some sort of flavor lacking. I can't quite put my finger on it. But the cheese fries always hit the mark for me!Overall, love Peppi's and will continue to come back."
"3.0","Stopped in here for a quick drink before a show.  The hostess was very nice and the place was kind of empty, so I was able to get a seat at the bar.  The bar was nice and clean and seated a decent amount.  They have a lot of beers on tap, a lot !!I got my standard Gin Martini, which was very good and under $10.00.  Not bad for a place in the Theater District.  Not sure how the service would be if the place was hopping but for me, on a Sunday afternoon, I sat down and had a drink in less than 3 minutes.  The wait staff and bartenders were 20 somethings so I was privy to the trials and tribulations of a 20 somethings life, but... I found it amusing... kind of took me back to my 20's, well as far back as I can remember.  I would go back again.  It was cozy and clean and they made a good drink."
"5.0","Incredible food. We came without a reservation and they were SO courteous to us still with the wait time. Everyone there seemed like regulars and the owner seemed to know everyone and was personable; he even asked us how our food was. Get the crab cake risotto!!!"
"2.0","The staff here was very friendly and the sandwich was alright.  Portion sizes were pretty small though for the price and the apple they gave me seemed like it was chewed up by a dog (no joke.  There were brown teeth/gnawing marks on one side of the apple).  If it wasn't for the apple, I probably would've given three stars."
"4.0","Came here for lunch today. Overall good experience. They do get a bit busy around noon, but that's pretty much standard for most restaurants in Oakland. I ordered the Chicken Sandwich with the medium spice level and it was fantastic. Great quality chicken, with a good spice kick."
"3.0","So I went to get me some chicken. I found this hip chicken shack on the University of Pittsburgh campus.Its hip, modern, fun and clean. They have chicken sandwiches with pickles, slaw, some kind of sauce and you pick the level of heat of which there are 5 levels. They also have chicken fingers and fries and homemade cookies. There are 2 levels of seating.I chose the medium heat chicken sandwich. It was good and savory and had just enough heat without feeling like you were being burned alive. I did think my chicken could have been a little more moist.I like this chicken shack and would want to try higher heat selections each time I go with their homemade cookies."
"3.0","I come here for 1 reason and that's for the roof top. I mean everyone loves a roof top bar and I'm sure that's why this place is usually busy. I've been a bunch of times and I just don't love it. Drinks are ok, appetizers are ok, and service is ok. To me it's just an ok place, but I'm sure I'll be back because it's one of the few rooftops in Pittsburgh. It's best to come here for a few drinks on a warm night then get dinner at one of the restaurants below."
"1.0","I'm a frequent flyer at this location and normally service is top notch, however, during a recent visit I made reservations for my younger sisters birthday celebration. I specified a booth when I called ahead of time for reservation as we had a small child in our party. I arrived, the hostess was cold and unwelcoming, she seemed quite overwhelmed at the time. She said i was the first to arrive in my party, and offered for me to wait or to take me to our table. I requested to be taken to the table. I then waited 15 minutes in front of the host stand, she did not offer to take my coat, or acknowledge me in any way. When the remainder of my party arrived I let her know, we waited another 10 minutes before she acknowledged us again. She, again, did not offer to take any of our coats, then proceeded to seat us at a regular table. I asked if she could take us to a booth as requested when I initially made the reservation, to which her reply was 'ummm, I dont know' followed by an eye roll, as she quickly turned and hurried back to the host stand leaving us stand there. They did eventually get us to a booth, quite some time after our reservation. But our entire experience was ruined at this point due to this young woman's poor attitude and the way we were treated. It was my sisters first time and she was thoroughly unimpressed. The whole situation left me outright furious. Despite the delicious food and good service from our wait staff I will not be returning to this location."
"4.0","Really good place and nice people. I like the pastries, cakes, and Icecream. I have not had their food though. I bought my gf a cheesecake from there and it was very good.I like that the owner is willing to stock different items the customer may like."

WTF are you going to make a one handed sandwich? I left, never to return......"

"4.0","Super cool place. The drinks are great and the bartenders are very knowledgeable. The atmosphere is great for both a celebratory night out or to just chill out and grab a drink. The music is loud enough to enjoy but not so loud that you have to scream to be heard. The light is very low at night so you may have to deploy your flashlight camera to see the menu. This may be odd but it's totally worth mentioning in this review. My preference for water is usually soda over still but the water served here is actually very good. The temperature is perfect,  not warm but not cold. If it's unfilled tap water then I must say that Mt. Washington has some if the best tap water I've ever tasted. If I'm ever back in the city I will definitely come back here."
"5.0","Delicious. Authentic Nashville Hot chicken. The medium definitely has a bit of a kick for being medium. Just overall great."

"5.0","This was my first time at this location and we were referred here my a friend at work.  We walked in and the service was great.  We had some jokes with the staff and they made the experience fun.  The food was fantastic and the sandwich was huge and a great value for the price.  The decor was fun with old pictures and lots of Steelers stuff in the walls.  Also a ton of pictures to look at on the walls!   Great experience and great people and great food.   There are also lots of shops and fun things to do close by."
"5.0","It seems that my experience here isn't consistent with many of the other reviewers here, because I thought this location has great service and food. The employees I did interact with were very friendly, gracious, and efficient. Even better, the interior of the cafe is completely updated and clean, with plenty of tables to sit at. There are kiosks to order your food at, in case the lines for the registers are too long, which is helpful. I'm unsure if my experience was an anomaly, but I hope not!"
"4.0","Have I just been completely unobservant, or do they purposely make their buffet an inside secret that only regulars know about? We came here near closing time on a Friday night, wondering if we could get anything before they closed. We casually asked about lamb shank, and the guy told us that we can get it when the buffet starts. Now the heating counters at the back made sense! So I guess they do this buffet on Friday nights after the regular closing time--whether this was a special event or one that is more regular on other days, I have no idea. I don't recall seeing any other signs or reading other Yelp reviews about this.So we stayed and waited about half an hour (they didn't officially get started until past 8:20), and people kept pouring in over the next hour until the place completely filled up. At $15 a person (they price by the pound if you take out), it really was a good bargain. Most of their items are the same as on the regular menu, but what really stuck out was the lamb shank that we originally wanted. Huge bones with a lot of flavorful attached meat. What more can you want? Some of the chicken items were pretty dry, so I'll probably avoid that for future visits. They also bring out some soups, desserts, and a salad and fruit bar. So this was a pretty standard (but awesome) buffet."
"3.0","Stopped in for a couple of iced coffee's and some dessert was told at the register you can't sit inside if you don't spend enough on food you have to sit outside 94¬∞ outside today I said keep your chairs  I will go somewhere where our money is appreciatedI'm giving three stars because I don't know about the quality of their product. All I know is your attitude and management is missing the boat. More people should walk"
"3.0","Seated right away, even though it was a game Sunday. Host was great but server, JV, was not friendly. I ordered the smoked salmon Benedict. It was what you would expect, not amazing. The potatoes were seasoned well and really good. The food came out really quickly, I waited less than 10 min. If I were to come back again, I would try the sushi or cooked salmon entree."
"5.0","We had to eat a second dinner here after morcilla since the plates were so small, although delicious. I ordered a mini Maggie's farm. It was the perfect end to our second dinner. The burger was juicy, flavorful, and I loved the addition of the chile/pepper. I didn't taste much horseradish, but it doesn't matter. The burger was great. It came with a side salad with garlic vinaigrette. Loved the dressing, loved the lettuce. My friend ordered the fries. They are thin and perfectly seasoned. I love how this place uses salt. There is a perfect shard of salt in every bite.  Salt angel. We travelled to the harmony location several times based on some article about them being the best burger in Pittsburgh and I'm happy they opened their second location in Pittsburgh. I hate the metal plates in harmony though, they mess with my body."
"4.0","This place was small but really cool environment.  Menu has appetizers, small and large plated perfect for sharing.  Got there right as they opened but it didn't take long for the place to fill up.  There were three of us so we ordered the avocado deviled eggs as an appetizer, then crispy beef short rib and fried brussel sprouts & cauliflower, smoked Gouda Mac & cheese, and pork confit al pastor tacos.  Perfect amount for three.  Beer and drink menu was awesome - try the Arsenal Baby Waker Blackberry cider - it was great.  Two things that caused me to not rate as a 5.  NO DESSERTS AT ALL!!!! After such a fantastic meal I was preparing myself for an amazing dessert - but they had NOTHING. Just so sad.  Second thing was how unbelievably cold it was downstairs where the bathrooms are - like seriously no heat whatsoever.  Once I went down there I was freezing the rest of the night.  Two easy fixes folks."
"5.0","Being Thai I can tell you this place is really good! Just like moms cooking! Make sure you get a Thai tea with your meal!"
"5.0","Can't believe I haven't been here more frequently! Do not forget to order the lentil soup. It's easily the most delicious lentil preparation I've had at a restaurant. The service is quick and without frills. LOT of food for what you pay, so go hungry. There's an attached market with middle eastern foods and I always stock up on dates, ayran, lentils and so on."
"5.0","The bright orange stuff is the Chicken Tikka Masala.  It's pretty darn tasty here.  I've always only came here for the buffet so I can't comment on their menu.  The price is just right. It makes me sad that everytime I come here there is no one else there.  Plus they heavily discount their dinner dishes.  If I lived closer and parking was easier, I'd eat here more often."
"5.0","Such a great experience! My husband and I don't get out often and we decided to go to Lawrenceville. We are so glad we stopped here. Alex the Bartender was more than amazing, Super knowledgeable about all the beers and all-around friendly. My husband phone was about to die and one of the hostesses charge his phone on a charger for him. Great beer selection! great staff! definitely would go there again!"
"4.0","Enjoyed lunch with a friend yesterday. We work close-by and walked less than a block to get to this sweet cafe. A small bottle of water is given right after we were seated. The menu has several interesting choices. Enjoyed the fig sandwhich, which is huge and comes with a nice fresh side salad. A sweet touch was when we completed enjoying the sandwhiches, a complimentary plate of mini eclairs and strawberries was delivered to our table for us. The decor and atmosphere are colorful and relaxed, yet give an energetic vibe that invites you to come back again."
"3.0","Actual star rating 2.5 Background: Indian food is probably my favorite style of food, my wife and I have have been to India on a culinary trip and we have eaten in over 100 different Indian restaurants in the US over a 20 year period. So I am a little picky. We started of with a Samosa - the pasty was light and flaky, very good, however the filling left much to be desired. I have never had a samosa that had shredded (think hash browns) potatoes inside of it. The traditional is a mashed potato and the hash browns were not very pleasant. However the tamarind and hari chutney were very good. For entrees we had the Aloo Gobi Masala and the Chilly Chicken. The Masala dish was not inedible but was not a traditional masala or even one of the many variations that I have tasted. First of all it was very yellow because way too much turmeric was put into it. Secondly there was no underlying masala flavor or cumin that could be detected. It was just a bunch of turmeric, yogurt and garlic. It was edible but not what I would have called a Masala dish. The Chilly Chicken was good but again not what I expected. This dish was more an Indonesian or Chinese style cooking and appeared to be flavored with Sambal Oelek. Like I said the dish was good, but not very Indian in nature. The garlic naan needed help, the base naan itself was good, but tossing raw garlic that had been sitting in lemon juice or some other sort of acid was not good. Plus it appeared to have a small sprinkling of Parmesan cheese on it - strange. If one wishes to top it with something why not the more traditional chopped cilantro. The mango Lassi was served with ice (usually only done when it's very hot) and the Masala chai was good. After the failure at Udipi and now this rather under-par experience I am beginning to wonder if the burgh has any good Indian places to eat."
"2.0","Stopped in with Classy Mike and Pittsburgh's own Mr. Matt-boto during Mike and I's road trip from New York to Los Angeles.I could have given Pamela's three stars but I gotta be honest with y'all...Pamela's needs a shot in the ass to find that fire again.  Yes, I  understand that being endorsed by the friggin President gives you some mighty laurels to rest upon.  But Pamela's, y'all ain't tryin'.The pancakes are good.  Maybe even really good - probably 19 stars on my patented 25 star rating system.  But Pamela's just doesn't give a damn about anything else.  Aerosol whipped cream, Minute Maid sold in a tiny glass at a huge markup, and frozen fruit that's been sitting out for who knows how long.  C'mon guys, the endorsement of the President is something to live up to - not an excuse to cut corners.Food: 18/25 starsAmbiance: 13/25 starsService: 20/25 starsBathroom: 17/25 stars (you have to go upstairs to a separate shop)Probability of going back: 20%"
"5.0","Wow, wow, wow!  I have tried crepes, I have tried pancakes, but this was my very first experience with hot cakes. Both crispy and soft at the same time, huge in size, they make for an amazing breakfast. What a treat!  I ordered my with strawberries. My taste buds were pleasantly surprised by extra sugar and cinnamon added inside. Beautiful perfectly cooked combination. We came in on a Monday and we happy to be able to find sits right away. Our previous attempt the day before (Sunday) was not nearly as successful as the wait was 40 to 50 min long and we choice to eat elsewhere. I'm glad we made this trip back and tried the hot cakes. Restaurant also had a sign 'cash only' by the entrance. Not sure if they normally don't take cards or if it was a one time event, in any case it might be a problem for some customers and I recommend double checking prior to dining there of cash is an issue."
"3.0","When I first came here I LOVED it. But with subsequent visits, the chicken just seems to be getting drier and drier. They are big portions so you'll definitely get your money's worth, but if you want some juicy chicken it can be quite inconsistent. I've tried mild, medium, and hot so far, but it seems like sometimes the medium is a hot while other times it tastes like a mild. However, the waffles are very soft and tasty -- just not great when the oil from the chicken gets soaked in there if you are saving some leftovers. I love their sauce and I think I might even like it better than my all time favorite Chick-fil-A sauce! All in all, the hype around this place is warranted because of their aesthetic appeal, drafts, and local craft beers. I definitely will try some of their beers later!"
"4.0","Great place for really fresh sushi.Chef knows his stuff & speed to match.His years of experience & passion for sushi/sashimi is obvious.I always like Ikura & Sake (was good here too) but I was surprised how good the whitefish & other fish were.Definitely sit at sushi bar & learn about the craft.Ordering individual items you like would be my recommendation.Justin the server was great also.4.5 / 5 overall.I also check their salad to see their attention to details - & I wasn't disappointed."
"1.0","I would give zero Stars if I could. The service was incredibly slow took us over three hours to have our dinner. The food was not good at all. This side dishes were all too greasy / buttery, and the steak had absolutely no taste. I had lunch there before and because it was so good I couldn't wait to go back. My husband and I will never go back. We know of many awesome places to drop $250."

"3.0","The review below, 'R S,' sums it up perfectly. Strange selection of beers and as much as I do not wish to say it, pretentious foods also. If you want cow tongue, come here. It is tough to find a decent Hefeweizen or IPA, standard offerings at most breweries. Otherwise it's a nice clean place that is welcoming. Maybe it was the wrong season, next time I hope the selection is better. I'm not that picky either, just want something not so experimental sometimes."
"5.0","Excellent tacos in a small joint with nice decor. However, service is a touch slow the tacos are worth it."
"4.0","*HIGHLY RECOMMEND**4.5 Stars*If you are looking for a good Japanese restaurant in Pittsburgh, this is the place to go. Out of all the Japanese restaurants in Pittsburgh I've been to thus far, Umami is the best. Walking up the stairs to get to restaurant, you'll be able to see unique Japanese wallpapers and decorations that marks their territory. The restaurant is set up with an izakaya style in mind with a bar, an open kitchen bar, and large party rooms with floor tables. This place is super popular with an hour or more wait during weekends so I recommend reserving at least 2 weeks in advance for weekends, and 1 week in advance for weekdays, or go right when they open.*DINNER*Suppai Shoga (alcoholic drink): the ginger taste comes through strong. I personally do not like ginger so I did not enjoy this as much.Karaage: crispy and tender and full of flavor. I love the spicy mayo sauce that came with it.Takoyaki: Delicious, one of my favorites here. Food chew, not too doughy, comes hot.Robatayaki: we got the chicken heart, quail egg, and wagyu beef and it was a bit disappointing. There was not flavor besides the char. The meat was tough as well.Chirashi bowl: Definitely one of the freshest raw fish you can get in Pittsburgh. I love that it came with a soy sauce pipette; gave just the right amount of flavor to the fish without overwhelming the natural flavors of the fish.Tonkotsu Ramen: good ramen with a good chew; nice flavorful hearty broth. The meat, however, was dry.*VERDICT*I would definitely go back again as this is probably the best Japanese food you can get in Pittsburgh. They have great food with a seasonal menu and nice presentation."
"5.0","I can't say enough good things about Thai Gourmet. It is the freshest, most delicious Thai food I've ever tasted. Family-run and comfortable, the waitresses have literally said things like, 'My mom's cooking today, she makes it really spicy, just so you know...' And they will actually make your food spicy. If you order a 10, damn sure it will be a TEN. The lunch special is the best deal in the city. For around $7, you will get a spring roll, amazing lemongrass or wonton soup, plus your invariably gigantic entree. I have actually taken leftovers from lunch, which I honestly don't think has ever happened before. The Nam Prik is my favorite: a bowl of saucy, spicy, peanutty (?) chicken, with noodles, tempura vegetables, and lettuce on the side. The basil chicken, pad see ew, and prik king are not to be missed. Even the General Tso is wonderfully unique. Plus, your food comes really quickly, which I appreciate at lunch."

"5.0","We stopped here since we were checking out some of the breweries in Lawrenceville that we haven't tried, yet. I was glad that we did because this was a really neat little spot!It's very modern/eclectic inside and I love the the overall aesthetic of the brewery. They have a few chairs for outside seating (although it was way too cold out for that) and a lot of seating inside (tables, booths, and bar seating). They do have a food menu, as well. We didn't order anything as we just wanted to try their beers at the time. I had the Blazing Crude which was a coffee based beer and was really yummy. Others ordered the Stack which was also pretty tasty. I definitely want to go back and try the food, too. They have Haluski and pierogies on the menu - how Burgh is that? :)"
"4.0","We only had drinks, I had the cantaloupe 'soda' and my husband the chai tea. The cantaloupe soda was very good and actually am sad I haven't tasted anything like it before and won't be back anytime soon :(.My husband said his chai was watery and I would agree as they only used one tea satchel for around 18 oz of liquid. For drinks I felt the prices were good."
"5.0","Being from Seattle I always expect fresh high quality fish. While driving through Pittsburg PA I found Kiku and was blown away. The service was fine, the price was a little high but the sushi was amazing. I had the Toro, Big eye and Hamachi. My wife had the seared tuna salad ( also rated a 5) if you enjoy quality sushi you should give it a try."
"5.0","YUM! I've never been to Salem's location, but have had their food many times catered at the office where I work and love it - so I wanted to give a review. I really need to visit their location. We usually have the chick pea curry, samosas, chili chicken and veggie curry. OH MY! Everything is truly out of this world. Their veggie curry has all my favorites - broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, potatoes, zucchini. I love spicy food and all of this just really hits the spot. The employees that cater at our office are always so awesome. Handing out 5 stars to this place is easy. Looking forward to stopping by their shop next time I need my fix!"
"3.0","Ok, I get it. Brunch is amazing. Sunday brunch is more amazing after a late night on Saturday. And I wholeheartedly agree that the food here is good- (how can you mess up brunch?). However, this branch on Shadyside is a nightmare to go to on the weekends. It takes FOREVER to get a table here every time. There are mounds of people that line up on Walnut Street to get a table. After spending the time outside, any food they offer you will sound amazing because your stomach is growling so loudly. Objectively, the food here is good and the dinner decor has a lot of character. However, I stopped going here a long time ago when I discovered that Harris Grill brunch is much more hearty and the wait will at least be half an hour less."
"5.0","Great beer! Subset of what they have at Cinderlands warehouse but I like the service and food here better. The warehouse is new and potentially cannot handle the crowds they see. But this is nice!"
"5.0","After getting gift cards for Luke Wholey's for Christmas, my boyfriend and I decided to save them for when the weather is nicer. Finally, the time has come that we've gotten nice, enjoyable weather and we decided to cash in on our gift cards. It's ok to go here when the weather is not so favorable, but I love feeling the breeze flow through a restaurant while eating, and it's nice to have the option to sit outside!We split the crab cake appetizer (2 small crab cakes), and it was the perfect portion size for the two of us. The sauce that came with it for dipping was their Cajun aioli, and let me tell you as the self-proclaimed Condiment Queen that this is one of my favorite house-made sauces that I've tasted. I ordered the blackened ahi tuna sandwich cooked rare, the only respectable way to eat blackened ahi tuna. The sandwich came with the Cajun aioli and a generous portion of well-seasoned fries. Ahi tuna has a wonderful, fresh yet almost steak-like feel to it. Cooking it too long causes it to dry out and lose some of the lovely flavor and moisture it naturally has. It was grilled to perfection for the short time that it was on the grill, and that deep reddish color in the middle was mouth-watering.My boyfriend got the Steel City Lobster Roll. He loves getting things that I don't cook at home when we go out, and I most certainly don't cook lobster at home. His sandwich came with huge, beautiful buttery chunks of lobster on it, and there was a good amount of Luke Wholey's lobster bisque on top. It was a work of art. If you don't like lobster, this sandwich may just convert you. When the waiter brought us our food he told us the restaurant was very proud of the Steel City Lobster Roll, and it isn't hard to tell why! Personally, lobster isn't my absolute favorite seafood as it can be a little sweet for my liking, but the lobster bisque balanced it out well. My boyfriend asked for a cup of the Cajun aioli on the side, and it was just as tasty on my sandwich as it was on the fries!Overall, I felt like the pricing was fair at Luke Wholey's for the freshness of the food and the portion size. Fresh seafood can get pricey, and if you view the menu you will notice a slight jump in prices between lunch and dinner. The portion size and dishes differ at dinner, but since I was here for lunch our bill for 2 sandwiches and an appetizer was a fair $45. Trying one of Luke Wholey's Bloody Marys and some sushi is on my list for next time. The service was friendly and quick, prices were okay, and the food was fantastic. I can't really think of anything that would've made our experience better, so we will definitely be looking forward to our next visit. Definitely worth stopping here if you're in the Strip!"

"3.0","Really fun place to come have drinks with friends. It is on the smaller side, so come early or be prepared. They have games you can play while you hangout which is why we come back. We played trivia, Jenga and cards against humanity. The drinks are delicious. Get the mojito!The negatives are that this place is pricey. My husband and I had a few drinks and an appetizer and our bill was $100!!!! Insane.Also I was not impressed with the food options. I prefer more 'normal' bar food and everything was a little too off the wall for me. I couldn't find anything to try. If you are into that and enjoy different dishes- then you will enjoy the food."
"1.0","The zucchini appetizer came out with 3 very small slices and the charge $8 for it.  Would never come here again."
"5.0","I love coming to this neighborhood market, the owners are incredibly friendly and the store is filled with great products.  I'm always surprised by discovering some great item on the shelves or by beginning some cool conversation with someone in the store.  What's unusual is there are no lotto tickets and no cigarettes.  The 2 women owners wanted this store to be about healthy options and a community gathering place.There are wonderful salads and sandwiches to buy, local produce, cage-free eggs, and delicious handmade breads. The prices are a bit higher than the regular grocery store, but the quality is much, much better.  And they are a lot more reasonable than, say, Whole Foods.Yesterday I noticed a great seed library tucked away in a back corner of the store.  The idea is to take and leave heirloom seeds with your neighbors.I look at this store as a bit of fresh sunshine in an urban setting.  So besides a handy place to pickup bread and milk, you may discover something new."

"4.0","Hands down one of the best bloody Mary's I've had! They give you quite the selection of infused vodka's to choose from when your building your own bloody. New to the Bloody Mary life? Don't fret - they will mix youup something tasty! Their seafood pizza was exploding with lump seafood - cheesy and delightful. I can't wait to get back here to indulge in more fresh seafood. Tip: Request a high top outside so that you can people watch while indulging in good food!"
"5.0","I came here with a group of 8 and the service was amazing. We did have a bit of a wait even though we had a reservation, but it wasn't unreasonable for such a large group on a weekend. They were courteous enough to call earlier in the day to let us know that we would have to wait. We started with bread and bean dip that was delicious, but the smoked gouda was my favorite appetizer. Everyone ordered something different so I got to taste a few different things and everything was seasoned/ cooked to perfection. It's also BYOB, so don't forget to bring a bottle of wine to have with your meal (or a 6 pack of beer if you're like me). I'll definitely be back here becausr they have just enough vegetarian options to leep me interested. The mushroom risotto was my favorite entree."
"3.0","Blonde female bartender was rude, slow, and not real smart. I waited 20 mins for a drink and didn't complain. When she brought it she began to lecture me on how she can only wait on 1 person at a time. Way out of line. Great food. The owner and waiter Kevin were both outstanding. If they'd shitcan the ignoramus they'd make way more money and I'd definitely give it 5 stars."
"2.0","What is the fascination with this place?  I have had lunches from Sausalido a number of times over the last year and the results are the same:  bland pasta salads and sandwiches that are 95% bread and 5% everything else.  Maybe it's my experience eating in delis in NYC where the meat/condiments make up 80% of the sandwich, but I just don't find S's lunch offerings worthwhile."
"5.0","Food blew my mind so good! Prices were great and so was customer service. Got a meal it was huge portion have dinner for tonight, thanks! Service was great, very nice staff! Got and would recommend chicken shawarma and tikka masala! Both fantastic!"
"4.0","There is typically a wait, so get there early. This weekend, we went around 9:30 and were sat right away, which we were a little surprised by, but there was a wait when we left. Service is quick, and the restaurant is clean.Their potatoes are amazing. The potatoes and onions are soft but have enough crispy bits that the texture is really good. I definitely recommend those, and you can get them with lunch too. I usually order one of their specialty hotcakes, frequently the blueberry ones. Thin crepe-like pancakes with buttery crispy edges rolled up around fruit. Mmmm...I want to go back just thinking of them. I've also gotten the chorizo hash, which is really good, and definitely too much food, but that's what I expect from a diner.This most recent time I went, I got Gail's Favorite eggs. It's scrambled eggs with cream cheese and green onions, served with the lyonnaise potatoes and toast. I thought the eggs were good, but was a little surprised that the cream cheese was just two little balls on top. I expected it to be little pieces mixed in with the eggs. While I enjoyed it, I might stick with other dishes in the future. It's been a while since I got those awesome hotcakes so already wanting to go back to get those again."
"5.0","I had their damn hot chicken sandwich and finally a place that serves heat that rivals what you may get at Bolton's in Nashville. The other rival hot chicken places in Pittsburgh make great sandwiches but they don't make it as hot.  Bird On The Run is good but there heat levels are weak. Thank you for not shying away about making something insanely hot that most people would not be able to eat. I was skeptical at first being on a college campus but this place is legit. Will eat again."
"5.0","A few of us chose to dine from Guapo while at Federal Galley last week, and the food and service were outstanding. This is Northern New Mexican cuisine, as evidenced by the green and red Hatch Pepper chiles. I see that the owner George (who grew up in New Mexico) patiently waited on us, and politely answered questions of me and my two child traveling companions. Is the Hatch pepper hot? Green isn't too bad, Red is hotter. What's Carne Adovada? Roasted pork (note: It's awesome)What's 'Christmas' style? Both Red and Green Chile Sauce.I ordered the Enchiladas with Carne Adovada, Xmas Style. It was a little swimming in sauce, but really really great, overall. The two young'uns split a Burro with Shredded Slow-Braised Roast Beef and loved it. We were just tourists, but this was a great first meal stop for us all in Pittsburgh!"
"5.0","Fantastic breakfast & brunch place! I love their Nutella crepes and French toast, as well as chicken crepes! Always fresh and very healthy. Service is very good, staff is very friendly. I feel like home. I love the interior design with unique paintings and pictures inside and colorful umbrellas outside. It makes a good place for both winter and summer! I strongly recommend you go and try their delicious menu!"
"4.0","I've been to the 1st and 3rd floors of Sienna Mercato many times, but last night was the first time I got the chance to try out Mezzo!  My girlfriends and I went there for my birthday dinner and I was immediately impressed with the decor on the 2nd level.  The first floor, Emporio, is a bit darker and louder, but Mezzo was bright, open, and furnished in a way that made me feel like I was dining in someone's home. It was very welcoming and a step up from Emporio in all senses.Our waiter thoroughly explained the menu and their specials of the day, and we placed our drink orders and requested the small PA Farmer's cheese board, along with the small bread basket (note: not complimentary. This is actually on their appetizer menu... I think it was $3 for the small).  The only bread I tried out of the basket was the rosemary garlic foccacia and it was SO good, especially with the whipped honey butter that the basket is served with.  For dinner, 2 of the girls elected to split the Wood Roasted Vegetable pizza, the other ordered a half portion of the mushroom risotto, and I ordered a half portion of the sausage gemelli.  When our dishes arrived, I was very glad that I ordered a half portion:  it was still a fairly generous portion, but just enough that I didn't have leftovers to worry about carrying around.  I tried a bite of the pizza and risotto and both were very good... the pizza had a very thin crust, but it was substantial enough to withstand the weight of the sauce and toppings.  The mushroom risotto was phenomenal and will definitely be in my sights when I go back... and my sausage gemelli was outstanding!  My only complaint is that the gemelli was cooked a bit TOO al dente... as in almost not cooked thoroughly.  They had more of a bite to them than I prefer.  The cream sauce and fresh, crumbled sausage were excellent and I'm almost wishing I would've ordered the full portion so I could've had leftovers for lunch today!Overall, Mezzo is a nice, open and airy spot for dinner and/or drinks and I would highly recommend it if you're downtown.   The prices are fairly reasonable, and they have a wide variety of wines and beers to choose from.  Another thing to note is that even though Mezzo is part of the Il Tetto and Emporio building/concept, they are each their own standalone restaurant with entirely different menus. No meatballs at Mezzo!  The nice thing is that this restaurant concept provides a variety of options for a night out.  From dinner to rooftop drinks, Sienna Mercato has you covered!"
"5.0","I celebrated my 21st birthday in the one in LA and my 24th birthday in Pittsburgh in November last year (lol I know it's been so long) but I liked it.  I made a reservation and told them it's for birthday.  I walked in, the hostess was helping me to take care my coat and led us to the table that was decorated with colorful pieces.  Food and service was very good too."
"4.0","I absolutely loved my recent outing. Although it is far from my first visit....I felt I could now give a well deserved review. The atmosphere is unique....You can do a private setting, or sit by the ample bar seating. I personally like the bar seating area. The noise level is typical of a sports bar but also creates a dining experience presence.The food is amazing! Very generous portion sizes, a festive sports centered variety. Awesome cocktails.,..and the Bus Steak Salad is an award winner (IMO) but feel free to find out for yourself! The wait time for seating can be tricky and on busy days quite lengthy...personally it's the only reason I gave 4 versus 5 stars. Otherwise it's an awesome place to be during a Steelers game! Try it! The Bus does not disappoint!"
"2.0","The reviews were so mixed which always makes you wonder if they're paying to have reviews written.  The answer is 'probably'.  I ordered on seamless and they came up as a place that delivers (after one am).  I ordered a hoagie, boneless wings and a quesadilla.  The hoagie was actually decent and edible.  The boneless wings were just slightly undercooked and rubbery. The quesadilla - not sure  what they did here but they either don't own a fry pan or a flat top because it was just a soggy shell full of yellow cheese.  It had potential.  Hey - I am one guy and ordered 3 things and one of the items was edible.  Small win for me, but I'd say this place needs to spend some time and hire an experienced cook."
"3.0","From the outside, you'd think this cafe would be tiny, but they utilize their space pretty well and have an outdoor seating area too. We came for brunch on a Saturday and were seated right away indoors because there was no more space outside. The menu is plain and simple; they offer several omelettes, crepes, and French toast to choose from. We ordered the Spanikopita French toast (Baby Spinach, Feta, Asiago, Fresh Mozzarella, Balsamic Glaze), mocha French toast, and Swiss omelette. The Spanikopita French toast is the first savory French toast I've ever had and it was pretty good. The mocha French toast and Swiss omelette were unimpressive thoigh. The former was just bread soaked in chocolate with whipped cream on the side and the latter was just your typical omelette (a little dry though). Would recommend this place if you're looking for a casual brunch spot and I can imagine the brick-walled cafe being very cozy in the wintertime.

"5.0","We loved this place so much we went twice in the span of 2 days. We would've gone again if it weren't cash only. Anyway the hot cakes are incredible first day I got the banana and chocolate chip hot cakes and these are cooked so perfectly with nice crispy edges on the crepe-like hot cakes. You cannot miss the homefries/famous lyonnaise potatoes these potatoes are to die for, some of the best home fries I've ever had. The first day we came it was about lunch time so my eating partners both ordered the diner burger and they absolutely loved it. Today they both had the chorizo hash special which was also amazing. Needless to say anything you get is going to be great. The staff is nice and you can get in and out really quick if you need to. There were no waits either of the times we came through. If you're in Pittsburgh this place is not to miss!!"
"3.0","Recently went here with my sister and parents. We ordered the Brussels sprouts, Caesar salad, and a few sandwiches. The Brussel sprouts were really good but the Caesar dressing overwhelmingly tasted of anchovies. Additionally, I got the fried chicken sandwich and it was so over cooked that I stopped eating after the first bite :/ but if it had been cooked properly, I believe I would have enjoyed the flavors.Unfortunately, our waitress was not the friendliest and spoke fairly condescendingly to us the majority of the time. I almost spoke to the manager to request a new server. (Which says something because I was in the service industry for years).The food was clearly made of good and local ingredients. Unfortunately, the delivery was missing. But that, on top of the poor service, makes me doubtful that if I'll be returning."
"2.0","I decided to give Kiku a whirl since it was probably the least touristy of dining establishments in Station Square (which proudly features Joe's Crab Shack and Hard Rock Cafe).  It was edible but certainly there must be better Japanese food somewhere in Pittsburgh.  I started with a small size Udon which was decent - had one shrimp tempura, fish cake, mushrooms, the standard stuff.  Next up was the salmon and avocado roll - not only was there more avocado then salmon but the rice around the roll must have been a 1/4 inch thick!  Talk about stingy with the fish.  I also had a spicy tuna hand roll which was pretty good but not spicy enough.  I looked around at the nigiri at other tables and there was a big base of rice and the fish definitely didn't extend past the edges.  The restaurant is also in need of a renovation.  The seating areas were very dim but the sushi bar had lots of fluorescent lighting going on and it was a very harsh, uncomfortable, unflattering contrast."
"5.0","OMG THE FOODHaluski and fried chicken Sandwich OMG"
"3.0","Meh. Pizza was ok. Nothing to write home about.Honestly, if it hadn't been 11:30pm on New Years Eve, the service would have really gotten to me. Don't get me wrong, I was still pissed. But I am a reasonable human and realized that it was not an awesome night for these poor girls serving endless drunk assholes. We ordered two pizzas, they only made one. They told us the second would just take 5 minutes, it took 20. All in all the pizza wasn't worth the frustrations."
"5.0","HIGHLY RECOMMENDED this place ! If you want to have amazing and delicious breakfast YOU MUST visit this caffe ! Atmosphere and design is really cool ! Gonna come back for sure !  Service is great ! Thank you !"
"5.0","Got the tandoori chicken meal, chicken shawarma salad, naan and lentil soup. Everything tasted delicious like usual. Also got this for takeout and very generous portions and packed nice. Always love getting food from here highly recommended."
"5.0","I loved Umami! I have been dying to come here for a while now after my friend came here and raved about it! Finally, we had an open evening, so I made reservations for a Saturday night at 9:30 PM. Umami was truly a unique experience unlike anything else in Pittsburgh- for the evening, it felt like we were in another city. Walking up the steep steps into the restaurant, you can tell that this place is something special. When you finally arrive upstairs, it has a dark and super trendy vibe. It is pretty small upstairs and was packed by the time we got there. We were seated at a high top table along the window. I loved the atmosphere here- it was very authentic and cool. They even had a room to the side where you sit on the floor during your meal- how fun is that?! Our waiter greeted us right away and got us started on drinks. He was very helpful and informative on the menu since we were all first timers! After browsing the menu for awhile, we basically wanted to order everything! We decided to start with some of the skewers. The 4 of us ordered the wagyu beef tenderloin, bacon quail egg, and pork belly. All of these were fantastic- but the wagyu beef tenderloin stood out the most. This tenderloin melted in your mouth.  Chris & I also shared an order of the Pork Gyoza potstickers- also amazing! The couple with us shared 2 sushi rolls which were served differently than I have ever seen them. They were served almost like a burrito (not cut) and also had an injector of eel sauce inside of them. They both liked the sushi as well. For our meals, we all were craving the noodle & ramen dishes. The boys both ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen, I ordered the Miso Ramen, and my girlfriend ordered the Yaki Udon. My ramen was full of flavor and the small bites that I had everyone else's was also incredible.  We all agreed that these dishes were so unique from anything we ever had and overall outstanding!! If you haven't checked this place out- DO IT!"
"1.0","I was disappointed. The sushi was not as good as the ready made at Publix. The drinks were basically zero alcohol content. The server was nice but not really effective. Definitely wouldn't come again. The tempura had no flavor..."
"2.0","I used to really like this place but there has definitely been a decline. Even my last review was probably a little generous because I was thinking of how this place used to be. Today I was here and we were seated outside, there was one very large party and a bunch of scattered smaller groups but overall not crowded at all. Our waitress was very friendly and for the most part pretty on top of things. We were seated outside and it was windy, large umbrellas were just falling over, definitely a safety hazard. Our food took a very long time to arrive and when it made it some of the people I was with said that things were cold. Someone I was with returned her boneless wings as it seemed they had sat out for awhile. I had a salad, I wasn't crazy about the lettuce they used and it was a little lacking on the amount of protein. Obviously love The Bus, but based on the shape this place is in and the fact that nobody ever seems to be there, I would not be surprised if this place was closed in the near future. The surrounding area has exploded in the past few years and I can't imagine the real estate is cheap."
"3.0","Looked this place up since my mom wanted to try their egg rolls, my brother goes here on occasion and always raves about the egg rolls. i decided to come here to look at the reviews and they werent all that bad except for a few. Those few were the ones i actually read fully. sad to say i must agree. Went here yesterday on a sunday afternoon around 2:30 or so. The place was clean and looked really nice inside. We were seated a couple of tables from the bar, which looked awesome, nice flat screen t.v. My mom and i had the wonton soup, egg rolls and pork dumplings as an appetizer. i thought the wonton soup and dumplings/sauce were very good. The egg rolls were okay but i think people believe theyre all that due to their size. One reviewer here said that the insides had the consistency of baby food. This was true...i had the chicken egg roll and when i opened it up everything was mashed together. im used to being able to tell whats in my egg roll, i had no clue what i was even eating. my mom had the veggie egg roll and she had no problems with it. We did have tea  and that was good. For the main meal i had chicken/beef chow fun and my mom had chicken chow mein. i stopped getting chow mein of any kind because its always all veggies and not enough meat. when hers arrived all i could see was green and white veggies with tiny strips of chicken. Mine had flat/fat rice noodles with huge chicken pieces and i had to literally try and find the beef. Whats sad is the chicken was bland,  while the beef actually gave the dish flavor. i could go to my local Chinese rest called No. 1 Chinese in verona and get better chicken than that. I dont agree that this place is THE best chinese place in pgh because pgh doesnt have really good chinese anywhere! maybe in other states just not here.I would go again because im curious as to how their general tso's tastes and i really liked the chow fun. i just wont get it with chicken next time : P"
"4.0","First time here on a Wednesday night. Nice crowd and very friendly staff. We ordered crab legs, lobster bisque, scallops and shrimp all excellent! We will definitely be back! We had a terrific meal and couldn't have asked for better service!"
"5.0","The barista was very pleasant and handed me one of the strongest cups of coffee I've had in a long time.  Not only did it help with the rest of my day but it had hit the spot...the roast that day was nutty and warming.  They have a nice selection for bagel sandwiches as well.  They were able to accommodate with my lactose sensitivity and slabbed on some hummus instead.  They also had other alternatives.  The salmon was fresh and cured just right.  It is conveniently located next to children's if anyone needs a break, you must stop by this spot!"
"5.0","I decided to check this place out since it has been a while since I've been on the North-side. There is street parking along with a parking lot on a diagonol behind it. All parking is metered wherever you park.Came inside. The atmosphere was 'homey' with wooden tables and chairs. In an adjacent room there is a sofa and table to relax. The place wasn't at all busy for lunch so I decided to order the pear arugula salad. I asked the counter person regarding getting a cold tea since it was an unusually warm day. She told me that all of their teas can be made cold upon request. There was one that interested me which was called 'Peach apple cobbler tea.' I asked about it and was told  that it has that flavor to it along with cider mixed in. Seeing fall had arrived I opted for that one.She also explained to me that my salad would come with bacon, pecans, and Gorgonzola cheese which I said was fine. The dressing used is a pear vinaigrette that also contains the same cheese. I went to sit down to wait for my order and observed that they have takeout, a wall full of various teas and huge desserts or pastries available for purchase.Finally she explained that they have a reward program via Perka where if you purchase a total of 6 teas then your 7th one would be free. This is a good reward program for anyone who frequents the place.I got my salad and it was indeed delicious! I had ordered the large size of the cobbler tea and found it just as good with enough cider in it that I didn't need any added sugar. They also specialize in peach lemonades for cold drinks and have a great assortment. The salad was served on a regular dish along with an actual fork and knife on a tray. Once finished there is an area where you can throw away your trash and place the tray and utensil as well as the dish in a separate area.Prices are reasonable whether you are ordering a salad, sandwich, or pastry to go with your tea of choice. This place is another neighborhood gem. It sits close to Allegheny General hospital on East Ohio St so it is best to come in the off hours. Am looking forward to my next visit to try a hot tea and perhaps one of their pastries."
"5.0","I have to say this again, Kiku is my favorite sushi restaurant in the Burgh!! This time we sat at the sushi bar and ordered nigiri (single fish sushi), actually we ordered the omakase (chef's choice). The fish quality is great. I can care less about the maki rolls. If you get the maki rolls, the quality and flavor of the fish can get lost. Also, you won't get to have the fatty tuna in a roll. You'll be missing out!I highly recommend the nigiri and sashimi for sushi because you're able to really enjoy how wonderful each piece of fish tastes. It is definitely the way to go!"
"5.0","Yummy foods! I ordered garlic naan and chicken curry both are so delicious."
"5.0","I absolutely love this place! I definitely recommend getting one of the combo meals. Definitely a bang for your buck. My favorite dish to get would definitely be the Arepa Pabellion. The sweet plantain just makes the arepa taste so good. I also would try the sauces. I've tried the spicy avocado sauce (not really spicy), the hot sauce (this is pretty spicy), and the regular avocado sauce and they're all really good! They add just an extra kick to the food. Arepittas also does bulk orders. My company has ordered from them a few times for small lunch events (a group of 12), and they have handled it very well, even writing the name of the person's order on each bag."
"4.0","Gorgeous in the summer, and even better if you can get a seat (or a standing spot with a view!). They have fun, good drinks that are pretty much average in terms of price, at least for downtown. Their Caipirinha is especially good. It can get pretty crowded by the bar but even so, service is pretty fast! When you close your tab they are really quick about getting your card back to you, which is nice."
"5.0","The food here is amazing!  I work nearby and come here at least once a week.  Even if you're not adventurous enough to try some of their Mediterranean dishes they have the most amazing burger!"
"3.0","This is probably by far my favorite location. The food portions are immense. Beyond belief. I love the hot cakes more than anything and always order them with a side of sausage. My daughter and I will often share the hot cakes and I'll eat the sausage (she's vegan) and we still have leftovers. Totally could feed a family of four on one hot cake. Ok so i am exaggerating a bit but hey it's delicious and plentiful."
"5.0","We had a great lunch here!! I had a the blueberry ricotta pancakes, and my girl friend had an omelette! Both were reasonable prices, big portions, and took a reasonable time to make! The set up was great where you ordered upfront, and someone brought the food to your table when it was ready. Even though the restaurant was busy our food did not take long as I said before. They had a great selection of breakfast and lunch selection! I would definitely come back, and highly recommend this place!!"
"5.0","So I've been in the food industry for over 17 years and I must say........ this is beyond a gem. This isn't even a diamond. Imagine a moon stone falling from the heavens that your grandmother gave you on a necklace that her grandmother gave her from your great great great grandfathers coal mine that was in his hands as he slowly passed away next to his canary. Yes it's that much. I find myself leaving this establishment with a cold notion that I'm leaving. They have outlets, charge stations, board games, attractive staff and cocktails that seriously make you want to shake your fist at your grandmother screaming, 'I thought you made the best sweet tea??????!?!?!??' I was even a jerk and ordered the same cocktail from both bartenders to see their work........... I have never been so impressed. My olives were just that olives, as they should be, just olives....... I don't need some cilantro aioli or sprites to deliver it to me. I want olives and just olives and I got just that......... man are they delicious......... the only problem I could express of this spot is the fact that I do have to leave and they do have to close......... *Warning* you will get the best cocktails here and you will question your local and loyal bartender........ May you be warned..... l"
"3.0","The food was really good. I had the berry French toast and my wife had a chicken sandwich with avacado spread and bacon. The low rating comes from slow service. A long wait to order, a long wait for our food, a long wait for our check. We sat outside on the patio, it's a very cute area."
"5.0","Everything was excellent. I had blueberry pancakes my friend had a burger...it was all great. While waiting in line to order they gave us a table number and found us a table upstairs on the balcony. My new favorite place in the Strip."
"1.0","I thought the dishes here were flavorless and almost everything was prepared differently than every other Thai restaurant I have been to anywhere, and not in a good way.  Go a block up the street to Thai Cuisine instead."
"4.0","Walked in and could smell the beard and cookies baking...Oh so Nice!  If you are looking for an enjoyable meal with food made from scratch with fresh products, this is the place.  The menu has breakfast (I think served until 11am), salads, burgers and sandwiches.  I ordered the Prosciutto sandwich that had fresh mozzarella, pesto, olive tapenade, roasted peppers on home baked ciabatta.  Delicious!  The meat and cheese were so good and the olive tapenade and roasted peppers added a wonderful flavor.  The sandwich came with a pickle wedge and some potato chips.  For some reason, this potato chip hound was not a fan of the potato chips.  Not sure of the brand or if in house but think they were bought not make in house.  Someone in our group ordered a salad, that has huge and looked to be very fresh ingredients.  Service was very friendly.  You order at the counter by the door and they give you a number for the food to be delivered.  After delivery, we were asked a couple of times how everything was and the staff seemed to make sure everyone at all the tables and take out orders were happy and received great service.Cafe Raymond has been on my list to visit for years and will make sure I have a return visit in the near future."
"5.0","Great variety of sandwiches and all day breakfast. I had the buffalo chicken wrap and my wife had the Verona (turkey breast, smoked applewood bacon, cheddar, lettuce and tomato on ciabatta) The wrap I had was delicious and my wife enjoyed her sandwich but they forgot the cheese on the Verona. Fret not, customer service was amazing and when I mentioned the missing cheese after a hostess asked how everything was they offered a free pastry! Chose red velvet and wow moist not stale and sitting out for days- very satisfying. Visiting from DC but when we move to Pittsburgh will definitely come back for the all day breakfast cause it looked just as amazing!"
"3.0","To be honest, I don't really understand why this place is so hyped. I came here with a friend and we each got a chicken sandwich with cole slaw in it, a side of fries, and a drink. The chicken itself was pretty big and tasted good, but the sauce and slaw drenched the whole sandwich and ruined it for me. Additionally, the sandwich and fries were way too salty for my liking.People say that CHiKN is like a glorified, fancier version of Chick-fil-A. But I have to say that Chick-Fil-A sandwiches taste way better, are cheaper, and they have waffle fries."
"5.0","I love their gnocchi with sugo (the dumplings so light, the sugo so rich), shrimp and orecchiette diavolo (like all great diavolo, so seductive - always want one more bite), and pizza margherita (perfectly light and crisp crust, generous tomato, mozzarella and basil, plenty to set aside for tomorrow's breakfast). The room and gorgeous and the folks who work here are sweet as can be. Thank you, Mezzo!"
"5.0","Oh my goodness I absolutely love this place! Strawberry hotcakes have brown sugar creme cheese and whipped cream! Also love the chorizo sausage with eggs n hash! Fresh strawberries year round wonderfully delicious !"
"5.0","I come here at least twice a month, always good service. Rarely have issues, salad Bar is always fresh! One of my favorite eat n parks."
"1.0","Just stood 2nd in line for 15-20 mins while the cashier prepared a huge order. Everyone including the manager just walked past as the line got longer. Not once did the girl call for help. This is not the first time it took close to 25 mins for me to get my food. That's my whole lunch break. Sure I can order ahead but then they place my food outside the counter where people's can just pick it up. I'll go to the one on the Blvd of the allies from now on."
"5.0","Amazing flavors and prices! Also I think they're the only place in Oakland that has FULL wings."
"4.0","This was everyone in our party's first visit to Umami. (There were 8 of us.) It's a very cool spot above Round Corner Cantina in Lawrenceville. (It could use better signage though.) Pros: The waitresses are very friendly, accommodating and attentive. We never had empty drinks and the food came out quickly despite our larger party on a Friday nite. The food...delicious!! We had starters which were various proteins on skewers with a tasty sauce. Pork belly, quail eggs wrapped in bacon, Waygu Beef and shrimp (pictured) as well as a large mushroom and shrimp tempura (not pictured). The sashimi plate was as delicious as it was a gorgeous presentation. You could tell they use high quality fish. The cocktails were very good, strong and it was nice that you could pick from gin or vodka as your cocktail base. (Tokyo Rain Drop was my favorite.) The DJ or music they had playing was just loud enough, enjoyable and upbeat. The ambience is eclectic, colorful and changes as you ascend to the 3rd floor. Bravo Umami for superb decor! Cons: The seating if you have a party over 6 people. They only have one room to accommodate 12 people max. The room itself is a nice size with a gorgeous ceiling mural, but the tables are in a 'pit,' so you have a significant step down into the pit to sit at your table. At first we thought we were sitting on the floor on pads, but that was not the case. No one in our party minded since we are all in fairly decent shape with no major issues, but anyone with knee, leg or other issues, this would be a deterrent. Also the restaurant and bar are on the 3rd floor with the bathrooms on the 2nd floor and they're a bit hidden. Just a heads up for anyone with issues climbing 3 flights of stairs and so on. Parking can be tough anywhere in Lawrenceville so I always suggest leaving a bit earlier or take a Lyft or Uber."
"5.0","The best thing about Umami (besides the food of course) is the element of surprise. First you're walking up two flights of stairs and it's like where am I going and then you enter the restaurant and it slowly opens up to this trendy place that makes you feel like you're in New York City rather than Pittsburgh. There's neon lights and you're up a few flights and it's just like, wow this is really cool. Perhaps the best surprise, though, was that we sat at the kitchen bar (which I would highly recommend around 5:00 if you can't get a reservation) and we got to watch the chefs the whole time! It's just a direct view into the kitchen which was so so neat to watch.Everything on the menu was super interesting and very good. Each dish had its own flair. The menu almost reminded me of a tapas restaurant where it was good to try and share a bunch of different things (which believe me, you will want to sample everything on the menu). I had a great ramen there and the octopus balls were incredible. You really can't go wrong, though.Such a fun experience overall and I'm still in disbelief that this is the first time I've been here. We will definitely be back!"
"4.0","A bit pricey but well worth it. I like sushi but I'm not an aficionado. Kiku's sushi is very well regarded though. My wife and I took a chance on the 8 course chefs choice meal for our anniversary and we were both pleased. Consisted of small plates with tempura, salad, sashimi, cod, octopus and so on. Plus dessert which was aloe vera with berries! For $50 it was a great meal. Not overwhelming and definitely better than the hibachi joints. They take restaurant.com certificates so that will make things more affordable."
"1.0","I had given them three stars because the place had really gone down hill. In fact until tonight I hadn't been there in years. After this experience they're now a one star rating and I'm desperate to give them zero stars. How I wish that were an option.Placed an order for delivery tonight, was told they don't deliver. Hello?!? They're on Grubhub! Ok whatever, told them my boyfriend would pick it up. We're told 20 minutes. He gets there and no one greets him or assists him. He tries to get help only to be ignored. I called the restaurant FIVE times to tell them he was standing there waiting for service. I'm lied to and told they've talked to him and our food is being taken to him. An hour later he's still there (order was placed online and my card was already charged $55). He gets home with the food (we live five minutes away by car). Our three orders of dol are missing as is an order of samosas and naan. There's a weird dish we didn't order that looked like crushed bugs. The one order of naan we did get had a baby roach in the packaging (see photo). Tried calling them back for thirty minutes to complain and get a refund. I'm calling again as soon as they open and I better get my money back. I just can't believe this even happened. We had to throw away all of the food because of the roach. I'm so sick over this. Please do yourselves a favor and stay away!!"
"5.0","I love ordering pizza from here! My boyfriend and I are regulars.i always get my plain cheese pizza from here. I am a simple person and only eat plain cheese, so nothing extravagant or difficult to master. But it's so good! My boyfriend gets the buffalo chicken pizza and he has always been a fan. Delivery is almost always under their 45 min wait time and the delivery persons are very kind. I love ordering from here"
"2.0","Normally I would give this place 5 stars but since early summer I've really noticed the service is not what it used to be and it's a shame because the food is always excellent! Aside from Abby most of the wait staff seems like they really don't want to be there. Wing night used to be every single week for us on Wednesday and we usually go or order out another time there. Haven't been back in about a month now... have been going to Olive or Twist or Bridges and Bourbon because of service and excellent management! I hope the owner steps up and addresses this issue because it really was a great place! If you do go make sure and ask for Abby or the girl with the red hair (not sure of her name! Sorry!!!)"
"5.0","My favorite... Always. I started coming here because it was by my orthodontist's office. The food is perfectly delicious, perfectly priced. I love all of their vegetarian options. When I met the man I am now married to, I brought him here and he loves it. We have tried other Thai places around town and in other cities, but most places are waaaayyy too salty. Thai gourmet is unbeatable in its perfection. The staff is always friendly and the order is never wrong."
"4.0","Clean and cute cafe! The people who work there are very friendly and personable. I had an incredibly difficult time deciding on what to buy because all the sweets seemed so novel! There were chocolate peanut butter pies, banana walnut cupcakes, caramel apple pies, and the like. In the end I decided on a slice of cheesecake and a red velvet bar with what looked like cream cheese frosting swirled on the surface and baked with the bar.The cheesecake was SO rich and sweet that even as someone with a major sweet tooth, I found it cloying after about 3/4 of it. The other customer who ordered it as dessert had to split it with two other people for that reason too.The red velvet bar didn't have the characteristic taste of red velvet though. It didn't even taste of chocolate/cocoa at all, which I found odd. And both cakes had bits of paper stuck to the bottom, so I probably ingested quite a bit before feeling a piece in my mouth.I do, however, like that they just make 'whatever they feel like' that day, as it makes for a pleasant surprise every visit.For my second visit, I tried the 'peppermint stick' and 'strawberry cheesecake' ice cream flavors. Peppermint taste was strong without being overpowering - wonderful flavor. Strawberry cheesecake was tougher to identify, though the strawberry part definitely provided plenty of flavor. They weren't so much creamy as icy.I definitely have to stop by again to try the sandwiches!"
"2.0","Geez is this place pricey. It is also sort of a 'tiny food' place where you don't get a lot for the cost. We only went because we had a huge gift card and still ended up paying more than we usually would for a night out.  Steak wasn't anything special, I wouldn't go back unless someone was paying for me. Staff was plenty helpful and friendly to us even though we were clearly out of our element with the expensive atmosphere."
"3.0","Hard to believe this Eat N Park has never been reviewed being one of the oldest in the history of the franchise. Eat N Park is a local franchise, the corporate headquarters are located at the Waterfront in Homestead. A Family restaurant, the menu is extensive, appetizers to salads, burgers to sundaes. It's all here. Who hasn't come here on the weekend to gorge themselves on the midnight buffet? Admit it, we've all imbibed a bit too much and needed something to make the morning hangover less painful. The grilled bearclaw is a Pittsburgh favorite, sweet pasty dough, cinnamon gooey icing, grilled in butter, served hot from the griddle, with coffee or a large glass of milk, this has been my choice meal after many nights of extreme alcohol consumption. The Super Burger is their version of the Big Mac. Only made better because it comes served on a dish and not in a cardboard box. With fries, this was a favorite meal when I was growing up. Breakfast is where Eat N Park shines, they make some awesome blueberry pancakes. Light and fluffy, stuffed with tons of blueberries and warm syrup, this is one of my favorites. Who can resist a smiley cookie? An awesome sugar cookie with glazed icing, they come in a variety of colors and even Pittsburgh sports team colors when it's playoff time. The famous strawberry pie is another favorite of Pittsburgers. Everyone looks forward to the very berry month of May. Eat N Park isn't for everyone, but when you crave a bit of the past or need a meal 24 hours a day, Eat N Park will be there."
"2.0","Honestly wanted this place to be good since I work close by, but the food here has been disappointing. Service is friendly but the food doesn't cut it. Very heavy kabobs and meat when ordering sandwiches/wraps from the menu.  Disappointing as you expect kabobs to be tender."
"5.0","I fuck with Arepittas HEAVY!  The food is delicious, the employees are helpful and friendly, and it's a good quick and secret lunch Downtown due to its Cherry Way location.  I have only had arepas and empanadas but they do an awesome job and I wish them lots of success.  My major complaint is they close too early at 4 PM and are not open on weekends at all.  I think it would be great if they created a breakfast option if they are going to close at 4 PM everyday.  My go-to is the Arepa Pibil with all three sauces."
"4.0","Local and Organic burgers with some uniquely crafted toppings or build your own burger.  What's not to like! Have been to the first Burgher's in Harmony and was in the mood for a good burger so we stopped by.  The restaurant is nicely done with a long bar but do not have a liquor license yet so it is BYOB.  The street sign advertised BYOB and our waiter said they are planning on getting a liquor license but it sounded like it will be a while.  So bring along a couple of beers or some wine to enjoy with your burger.Service was fast and friendly. I had the Pitts burger that has cheddar, slaw, pickle, basil, onion and a special sauce.  My burger was cooked to my order and was tasty.  I thought the toppings were good but the special sauce seemed to lack that Zip I was expecting.  Just had the regular fries and they are very good and you get a larger portion.  Maybe next visit we will have one of the For the Table/appetizers."
"5.0","First time visit with friends. Great value for $20 brunch specials! Delicious food and casual cozy atmosphere added up to a good time with friends. Highly recommended. Next time we will try seating at the back patio in warm weather."
"4.0","This was my first visit.  There weren't many people in the restaurant but my daughter and I had to wait about 45 minutes for our food. We would have left but we had a Groupon.  I hate when I see someone who came in after us receive their food before us. I don't blame the waiter because he doesn't cook the food. Darin our waiter was pleasant and met our needs.I ordered the 'Forest Hills' and swapped the bleu cheese for gouda with a half order of fresh fries. The burger was moist and flavorful and the fries were nicely crisped."

"1.0","AWFUL!! We've been to the Bettis Grille a few times previously and had positive experiences.  Sadly, this was not one of those times.  First, the air conditioning was out.  I get it things break, you can't always control that though it didn't look like anyone was in a hurry to fix it or apologetic about it.  The men's room was filthy.  There was no soap and no indication there had been soap present in recent history.  If they can't take care of the restrooms, what else aren't they taking care of?  I told the hostess about it who gave me a 'who cares?' look.  An hour later after a second visit to the men's room it still had not been refilled.  The remainder of the restaurant didn't look much cleaner.  Our group had simple orders of burgers and salads.  It took over an hour for the order to come out.  When it did finally come, the burgers were cold and looked like they had sat under the heat lamp for a while because the cheese had taken on a crusty look.  Also, the lettuce and tomato absent even thought the waitress had asked us specifically if we wanted that included.  We had to ask for silverware.  It just seems like no one in the place seems to care or have an interest in providing good service.  The whole place made me long for the more sanitary conditions of PNC Park.  This place is past its prime, go somewhere else."
"3.0","Really trendy rooftop bar downtown which makes it a great place for happy hour and for any other drinking occasion for that matter. Because of that, Il Tetto gets a huge crowd. If there isn't a line to take the elevator, there's a line to get a drink. I've never had the food here so I can't speak on that. The drinks are not too bad, but quite expensive. What I don't understand, though, is they have the exact same drinks as Emporio downstairs, yet they don't have the same happy hour specials.  They're banking on getting more interest upstairs so they can get away with charging more. Seems a little unfair since it's technically one business."
"2.0","The roasted turkey that I ordered from them for Thanksgiving didn't look or taste like roasted. Even if it wasn't roasted, it should have tasted good for the money I paid ($80+!). I have always had good experience with them with their meat and grilled food, but this turkey was a disaster, IMO. Still will buy other things from you guys, but no more turkey!"
"5.0","Great great Indian/ Middle Eastern food. Excellent meat quality. Good, quick service! And big portions!"
"1.0","Two out of three sandwiches were totally wrong and the one they got right was bland AF. I'm pissed I paid $50 for sandwiches I don't even want. Terrible."
"4.0","Went to Redbeard's with a party of 25 last night. Staff was very friendly and service was very good. Good drinks. Very good bar food.   the sweet chili wings, chicken quesadillas, nachos, poutine and the fish sandwich was fresh and enormous. Deep fried Oreos were very good also."
"4.0","Great ambience!  Friendly staff. Yummy crepes. Sit outside on the back patio, you won't be disappointed!"
"5.0","Went there the Monday after mother's day for lunch with my mom. Could not explain how all the hype was worth it. Katie, I think that was her name; made it. My mother usually doesn't drink but our awesome bartender had her drinking.if your looking for a lunch celebration? Please try it out."
"5.0","I'm In Pittsburgh,Pa for a weekend and tried this place out.  Glad I did.  The four of us shared a bunch of apps. Oysters were fresh and delicious.  I guess you don't need to be near the ocean to get good oysters.  We also had a tomatoes and burrata app. I thought NYC had the best burrata(it's a cheese if you don't know) but this was outstanding. We also had the lobster Mac and cheese and it was very tasty as well. My main course was the porcini ribeye steak. It was awesome, and cooked to perfection. They was a type of balsamic glaze that was amazing. I forgot to mention the delicious well drink they have as well. I had a Manhattan Rye and I really liked it.  The service was excellent as well. It was a great visit overall.  The only knock is it's a bit   pricey.  If you're on a budget I would choose another place.  If you can I would try this place for sure."
"5.0","The brunch here is spectacular , over the summer I frequenters this place and everything I ordered was amazing. I loved being on the upstairs on the deck in the summer, great view of the streets.  Great healthy options! I also have gone here for lunch and the Ni√ßoise salad is delightful!"
"5.0","I absolutely love it here. I live in the area and walk over at least once every two weeks. The store itself is extremely cozy. It gives off a rustic vibe due to the fact that it has a wooden countertop, wooden floors, and wooden tables & chairs as well. The staff is always friendly and more than willing to help. They are reasonably priced - and I love supporting a local business. Now on to the teas - I love the cold teas here and have tried the Yerba Redhead, the EoJito, and the Peach Apple Cobbler. They all have real pieces of fruit in them - lemons, limes, raspberries, and/or peaches, and I love them all. The food is fantastic as well, they have many sandwiches, salads, and smoothies! I always get the EO Beef and it's amazing every time. I would highly recommend checking this place out if you are in the area and want to try it!"
"4.0","Not one to frequent Mount Washington, I found myself looking for a late night hangout on a Thursday night.  Having heard of the Summit, the Yelp reviews encouraged me to try here.I started my night off with a cocktail that contained Cucumber Vodka ($8). It was one of my favorite cocktails ever, and it was simple. I think it was just Cucumber vodka and soda water, but it was light and refreshing. Loved it.We also ordered two appetizers, the PSV Rolls ($7) and the Goat Cheese Fritters ($7). I preferred the Goat Cheese Fritters, which are the same concept as Mozzarella sticks, but they are round balls full of creamy goat cheese. Yum!  The PSV rolls were fried pork and beef spring rolls with a spicy chili sauce. They were only OK, though the portion was larger than I suspected. All in all, if you are on Mount Washington looking for a delicious cocktail bar and some snack food, this is a great place!"
"3.0","My girlfriend and I just finished touring Phipps Conservatory by day and decided to eat here for lunch. Most of the food is home grown and many of them are healthy options. Pizza is available for all ages.It is set cafeteria style where you order and you are given a number to put on whatever table you wish to sit. The food is then brought to you. Should you decide to order a beverage then you are given a cup with your purchase and proceed to the drink station to get what you want.They also serve specialty beverages there but we decided to go with the a healthy option. We each ordered the vegetarian sandwich which came with a choice of side. We opted for the quinoa and slaw. The do have an option for $9.95 where you can order half sandwich and pair it with either a cup of soup or chili without meat or salad.We got our food served to us in a reasonable amount of time. The food was good to say the least because we don't often get a chance to eat healthy. When we were finished they have a selection of trash and recycle bins as well as one for dishes and silverware. Your food comes with real dishes and silverware which i would call Panera style.Little did we realize how crowded this place can get if you don't come early. We had arrived shortly after noon.  By the time we were done the place was packed with people! It brought a nice conclusion to seeing Phipps by day during the holiday season because there is so much you miss at night when the lights are on. Still this cafe is a nice place to unwind and take it easy if you don't feel like hunting for another place. Would definitely eat here again whenever we come again."
"4.0","This place was everything you'd expect, which is a good thing. Clean interior, a pizza with unlimited toppings for $8, and a decent staff. Is it the best pizza I've ever had? No, but it was $8. Is it the best food in Lawrenceville? No, but they're one of the only places open on a Sunday evening or Monday."
"3.0","Thai food is one of the easiest to make ethnic foods at your home and have it taste fairly authentic. So I generally rate Thai restaurants on how does their dish they make compare to how I have had in Thailand and how I make it at home. While the food at Thai Gourmet is edible, although greasy, my companion agreed that I could make better dishes than this. Now that does not constitute a put-down or I'm trying to say that the food sucked - it didn't it was good. (It's really hard to make Thai food poorly IMHO) However, as another poster said, they seem to know they have strong competition down the street where you get incredible food so they are trying to win on the portion size and value while the quality is not quite there.Take the 3 star rating for what's it worth, the food is OK but there are much better places to go."
"5.0","This place used to be called something else but the food is the same and still delicious. It is so close to my work and the prices are so affordable for a quick lunch. So flavorful. Their guacamole creme sauce is just so good. Their tacos are amazing and a lot of different menu items. They are also on ritual app which is convenient."
"3.0","So we were deciding on an evening bite but were dining on a budget. Groupon never lets me down in this area. So we found one for this place. $15 for $30 worth of food. I thought that was a great deal.We made our way into Oakland and the restaurant was located on 5thA just across from the hospitals. When we entered there was only one waiter serving everyone and seating. We had to wait for nearly 10 minutes while he took the orders of other guests before we were seated. Our table was comfortable but a little worn out. The groupon didn't apply to the buffet so we just ate off the menu. We ordered a samosa and channa chat. The channa chat was a chick pea dish, served chilled and the samosa was deep fried, hot and delicious!! The channa was just as good, it packed a lot of flavor and was served with onions and green peppers. For our main entree we order chicken tiki masala and lamb mango curry. For some reason i thought my chicken was going to be a wet dish but i was rather dry. The chicken skin was a little tough and dry although the meat was very moist and tasted like it had been grilled.My hubby's dish was a lot better than mine but it was very spicy. He ordered a 6 spicy level but it was more like a 9. I was a little disappointed that we didn't get much lamb in the dish and the sauce wasn't plentiful either. For $13.99 I figured the would get a little more curry. The groupon was good in this regard that i didn't pay full price for my food. Overall I mostly enjoyed the appetizer and onion naan bread."
"5.0","Fave spot to go every time I'm In Pittsburgh. Real quality not fast food , taste like love is cooked in the  every piece of rice."
"5.0","This is a very hip and innovative spot. It's not hard to find the restaurant. You just go up stairs. It is small and they get crowded so make a reservation on weekend nights."
"5.0","Always wonderful!The service is spectacular. Every time. The steak is, of course, spectacular. There is nothing in this world that is more delicious that their Kona Crusted steak. Seriously. It is the best place to eat in Pittsburgh. Always top shelf."
"5.0","Rialto has the best Sicilian Cuts in town.  I'm lucky enough to live within walking distance of these guys and I'm very grateful for that.  If I could, I would eat Rialto every day.  It's a must try for east ender's.  Don't forget to add extra cheese."
"3.0","We were in town and wanting to watch his Jets and my Steelers, so we thought Bettis' would give us a good mix of 'being with the crowd' actually attending a game, and 'being able to watch on TV.' We were correct in that regard, though the TVs were a little on the small side. I'm spoiled though, so I didn't actually complain about that or anything. Just something I noted. Being as it was game day we got there early, and despite being told there was a 2 hour wait, were seated within 10 minutes (our first drink at the bar hadn't even been poured yet.) I'm sure it's hard to guess whether a group is staying for the whole game or just trying to eat before heading to the game, so that was sort of understandable.I started with a mimosa, and then found out they were $8....and since they were served in a plastic 5oz water cup....not exactly worth it. We opted for the Miller Light $4 special instead. We shared a pile of wings, and the spinach/artichoke dip. The dip was one of the better ones I've had, and even though I'm not typically a pork belly person, it definitely added a little something something. The wings were good too, definitely meaty! We tried black and gold BBQ and Hot Buffalo. Whoo! That was hot. For serious.Overall, it's good people watching and sports watching, especially on game day, but there are a few things that could be improved upon (like the mimosa situation.) They had fun raffles and whatnot throughout the game too which was fun."
"3.0","My boyfriend and I went here after purchasing a groupon. For being a burger place I expected a little more flavor to my burger but it was very average overall. We both did make your own burgers and didn't realize until our food arrived now small the parties were. It was about the same size as a five guys 'little burger' but at a higher end burger place price. The fries were pretty good but nothing out of the ordinary. Our waitress was good and the overall decor was a modern/industrial feel. However, I don't think the food was good enough to get me back here anytime soon."
"4.0","Antoons is an Oakland staple. The pizza is good after a night out. I found myself here a few days ago. And wow is it still the same. The beauty of this place is explained in a few reasons. First, it is cheap, it is only $6.42 for a large cheese pizza. Second, they are efficient it is amazing how quick they can push out these pizzas late at night. Third, the portion is generous. While not the greatest pizza i've had its worth a visit."
"5.0","Thai Gourmet hits the nail on the head as far as delicious, authentic, quick Thai food goes.  Usually when I'm getting Thai food it is for take-out and the portions, prices, taste, and prompt service at Thai Gourmet keep me coming back regularly.  As far as decor goes, it's quite basic and definitely not a romantic nor trendy date spot.  I typically stick to the thai curries and go back and forth between the red curry and the panang curry.  They do Spicy level 1-10 and level 3-4 is quite spicy for even an american palate that likes spicy food.  The dinner portions are enough for two people to split and the lunch special makes for a perfect lunch as it comes with an egg roll and choice of soup and is enough to eat even if you're quite hungry.  At $6.99 for the lunch special Thai Gourmet is solidly in my rotation of lunch places."
"4.0","Husband and I enjoyed an impromptu visit to this restaurant one snowy afternoon before heading to the Strip District.  We didn't have reservations, but we were able to be seated immediately.  There was a busy lunch crowd with people doing working lunches.  Husband ordered tenderloin sliders with the Parmesan truffle fries.  These were worth trip.  I chose roasted chicken with risotto.  Everything was excellent. Alfonso was our waiter.  In spite of having several tables, he couldn't have been friendlier or more attentive. This is a pricey place for lunch for someone like me, but I will remember this visit."
"5.0","This remains the only authentic Japanese sushi restaurant in the Pittsburgh area. It has been here since 1982, and the chef is 40-year certified preparer - the real deal. I spend a good deal of time in larger cities - like NYC, where you can find good sushi on every other corner and I can say - as an advanced sushi connoisseur (I've been eating raw fish since I was 2) this place is the right place for the advanced palette. There will be things in the back that are not present on the menu so as not to scare away the average customer - but they will have everything that they can obtain safely - simply ask. Sure, it's going to be expensive. You have to pay much more for quality in a land-locked city, and Pittsburgh, though what I like to call 'cutely diverse' does not have the array of resources for quality sushi without a price. Ask the chef here and he will tell you that most of the seafood he has comes in from a very reputable atlantic source - think New York.I would recommend any handroll, and the specialty roll. Order Amaebi (raw sweet shrimp) when in season and you will be a happy camper. The oshitoshi is well seasoned with salmon skin and a delicious soy mixture - not too salty. And the green tea ice cream goes well with a spoonful of red beans.ENJOY!"
"5.0","31 years bruh.  That's all you need to know.  Ole sushi chef behind the bar has been in this place and making perfect sushi for 31 years. I was doing a search and noticed that this place didn't have the high level of rating that other more convenient places have.  And after showing up and looking at the menu it's totally clear that Master Chef is only gonna make real traditional sushi from Japan. Love it !!!     I'm sick and tired of all these suburb type sushi places that make only fried rolls or 'California roll' hybrids.  If you want the real deal and have a good conversation with the man.  Go sit at the sushi bar, have a sake and enjoy."
"5.0","I've only been to this bar one time upon writing this post, but my experience there was so awesome, I'm getting ready to go again here in a few minutes. The atmosphere was very cool. Definitely a bar that you'd see in, perhaps, Lawrenceville, so I think it definitely brings something different to Mt. Washington. The beer selection was fabulous, and the bartenders were very nice and friendly. I agree that a kitchen, when it opens, will make this place even more of a win!"
"5.0","The food was amazing! We went on Sunday and got the 2 for $25 deal! Such a great price for a ton of food! Went home with an entire serving for the next day! They were very kind and offered more rice for us to take home as well. I ordered the vindaloo and it was delicious! Get the garlic naan, it's to die for. Would recommend to anyone!"
"2.0","Ordered the mediterranean calzone, its too oily/greasy and the crust is soft. Nice service though."
"5.0","I don't really know where these poor reviews come from - I've been eating at Kiku for years and have never had a bad experience. Yes, the lighting is dim and it's not exactly chic, but the food is excellent. Kiku was where I had my very first sushi, and it's hard for any sushi to live up to it. The tuna and salmon rolls are always very fresh with the perfect amount of wasabi and their entrees are great, especially for those who don't like sushi or even Japanese food. And one of my all-time favorite foods is their tempura ice cream, with its sweet buttery tempura crust and fresh vanilla bean ice cream. Mmm. Delicious."
"4.0","This gem is located at the rivers casino. I'm not into gambling, just food and beer. The Wheelhouse has an awesome view of the city and a great array of screens, including a huge one, to keep an eye on the game. I have been here a few times and keep ordering their burgers. Drink prices are on the higher end unless it's happy hour. I enjoyed a great burger, fries and 3 beers during happy hour for around $30 and was very pleased.I recommend this place if you're in the area for a game on the north shore. The crowds are never huge. It's also great for a Pens pre-game if you're riding the T over to the arena. My only criticism is that they had a limited amount of beers on tap, but honestly, any cold beer will do the trick at a sports bar."
"1.0","The food is good the service is rude and slow. They make feel that they do not want you in their restaurant."
"1.0","Probably the worst experience I've ever had at a Panera in my life. Cashier was not friendly, did not seem to be engaged or even want to work. My food was missing chicken ... Went back to the counter and let them know.. the Young lady working behind the counter stared at me, did not apologize, but rather threw the chicken in the microwave and put on the counter and turned back around. I will never to this location. So far treatment and terrible food service"
"5.0","One of my favorite places to go in Pittsburgh. I have always thought of the Summit as more of a cocktail bar, but not anymore. The draft selection is excellent with choices from some of my favorite breweries like Stillwater and Singlecut. I brought a friend here to try some new beers as he is an avid 'Untapped' app user. We had a couple flights and the cheese board. Service was excellent, I highly recommend the Summit."
"3.0","I have come to the belief that one thing Pittsburgh has A LOT OF is pizza joints. Some better than others. With that said there is a jewel in the crown of Pittsburgh's Northside called 'Wise guys pizza'. Their menu has a lot of great gangster names and sayings, and adds a bit of mystic to ordering for first timers. Specials like 'The Don', The GODFATHER,  'the Luca Brazzi' fish and The KINGPIN. Additionally there are phrases like; side action, and a hoagie you can't refuse. While the menu is good, it isn't the star of the show. My experience with Wiseguys is that their food is a GREAT meal for a GREAT price. Their salads A#1, their wings not too greasy, fatty, OR dry. To quote my friend Goldilocks,  these wings are JUST RIGHT. Now earlier in this review I spoke of stars. The star of Friday nights show was the cheese steak hoagie. Brimming w/meat FRESH I say again fresh vegetables, and (a pgh thing) fries. Me, and my two growing carnivores left our dinner table quite sated.  Have I eaten there before yes will I eat there again oh heck yes. They are a good bang for your buck with several specials everyday. I end my reviews with this statement and my review of Wiseguys pizza will be no different. I vote with my money and feet, and rest assured that both will be making many more trips to this eatery. If you haven't tried it. Try it. It almost makes it worth your time to move into their delivery area!!!"
"5.0","Stumbled upon this place while walking to go somewhere else for lunch. Decided to go here instead. WOW! What a little tucked away gem. My coworkers and I loved it so much, we came back a second day in a row. I've gotten the burrito, which was HUGE. I couldn't finish it all. It was packed with rice and beans, onion, peppers, beef and everything in between. I also tried the beef empanada which was clearly very homemade and good!! We also shared chips queso/guac. Queso is so creamy and jalape√±o and guac was very flavorful!The second day I got the mole enchiladas and street corn. SO GOOD. Flavorful and satisfying. You can taste all the elements of the mole. And the street corn was sweet and creamy and a little spicy. I can't wait to literally try everything on their menu. Not only does this place have great food, it's run by Edgar (I am assuming) and two other ladies. They are always so sweet and nice! Can't wait to tell everyone about this place and to go back!"
"5.0","Place was so yummy unique and sheik ! Ithere was a Dj who was AMAZINGGG playing tunes I've never heard and ones I love. Mostly pop and hip hop. Some international songs also. Our server was so nice ! I got the rice bowl don't Remmeber the name but it was MORE than enough.  And so so good. . I also got the zucchini with ground chicken which I sadly did not like. It has a sweet taste to it that I would've liked to be spicy instead because I didn't like the sweet mixed with all the pepper... Would totally go back small place. Quick service. Awesome drinks highly recommend!"
"5.0","They were at Helicon Brewing on Saturday and we stopped by.  The bulgogi was flavorful, as should be expected.  The perfect amount of sauce and additions. We tried both the bowl and the tacos and would get both again.  Good amount of food.  Looking forward to seeing this food truck again."
"5.0","the best tea and sweets place northside has to offer . The coconut cream banana tea is the BEST. The almond crousant tastes super.Can't wait to go to an afternoon tea with tea sandwiches"
"5.0","Yeah, well, forget Sesame Inn.  Chinatown Inn wins hands-down.  I will DRIVE TO DOWNTOWN FROM MT LEBANON to get takeout here before I ever order delivery again.  Yes, that good.  Excuse me while I wipe my eyes clear of the duck-sauce induced tears.  Seriously: amazing fried rice and the velveting process they use leaves the meat moist and tender and yum!"
"4.0","Very cool atmosphere, rustic and homey. Larger than I expected on the inside with a side room that has a large couch and tables to work at. Tea is delicious and the staff are friendly."
"4.0","Soup in the breadbowl comes with an apple. Don't know it's usual or it is holiday special. I like soup and bread so this dish is definitely for me and panera does a good job. BTW, I tried mix vegs and chicken noodle. I prefer the latter one since it is less salty."
"4.0","As primanti's is to many Pittsburghers, Peppi's is to my boyfriend. He adores this place. We usually go to the one on the North Side (their back yard area is adorable!) but they were closed on the particular day we were planning to make a visit, which led us to the Strip. The seating is limited, so on a busy day, you may not be able to get a table. My mom, dad, boyfriend and I were able to find a table easily when we visited. My mom and I decided to split the Joey Porter 'Bella' hoagie (steak, portabella mushrooms, swiss cheese and horseradish sauce) and added fried onions, lettuce and tomato to our hoagie. We also ordered onion rings and French fries as well. My dad ordered the Italian hoagie and my boyfriend ordered the New Yorker, which is his favorite.My mom and I really enjoyed our hoagie, although we did find there to be a lot of bread on the sandwich. The bread was fresh and delicious, but made the sandwich extremely filling. The horseradish sauce on the sandwich was delicious and not very spicy. The onion rings were fresh and yummy and the fries were fresh cut! My mom and dad were first timers and really enjoyed their food. One important thing to mention- the service was amazing. The man who took the orders was very patient with my family, while we tried to figure out what we wanted. He gave us helpful suggestions and was overall very friendly. At the end of our meal, he thanked us for stopping in, which was really nice.Overall, I am not as obsessed with Peppi's as my boyfriend is, but I definitely enjoy their food. I don't think I will ever crave it like he does, but I don't think I could ever turn it down either!"
"3.0","While the staff are friendly, the burgers were only ok. I got the Maggie's farm burger and I was disappointed the cheese wasn't melted and seemed like it was slapped on at the end. Same thing with the Mexican war burger, the cheese wasn't melted at all. The green chilis also were one big chunk so it wasn't spread well and would come out in one bite. The buns appeared to be regular white bread buns without sesame seeds. The upgrade to the rosemary fries for $1 was definitely worth it though. Overall, the burgers were just ok and not worth the $13. There is also metered street parking."
"4.0","'One more burger joint'  Oh yes, 'ONE MORE BURGER JOINT'.  This place is the real deal.  I went early on a Thursday evening and no one, yes no one was in the place.  I wonder if the secret isn't out yet that the burgers are great.  When I say great, I mean that they were cooked to the actual temperature ordered.  I ordered Medium Rare and yes, my burger was bleeding.  My BF ordered Medium and again it was perfectly to temperature.  A little pricey, but menu is pretty diverse with a burger for all tastes."
"4.0","This review is for the Market section only.I've always wondered where I could buy a bone marrow - Well look no further. This is the place to go. Looking to buy a Goat Meat? Lamb Meat? or even simply a chicken - Yep! This is the place to go. The prices are very reasonable compared to other Grocery chain Stores. Even though the prices are not fixed and could change depending on the availability - it still beats other stores by couple dollars/lb.Besides, you can also find all sort of spices and masalas including various South Asian food products."
"4.0","the food is well above average and the staff is friendly.  What more could you want? I come here occasionally to get work done and it's a good place to hunker down, connect to the wifi, and knock out some emails."
"3.0","A good place for some decent indian food in Pittsburgh. The atmosphere inside is average and all the photo frames inside are slightly crooked but overall food quality is nice. I ordered the paneer tikka masala. The sauce was nice a rich and the meal came with rice and dal. The dal was nice a light making it a great pairing with the paneer. The rice was regular jasmine rice. Only issue I have had at this place was that the waiter was charging me extra for a side item that came with my meal and was charging me for the item because the menu had a misprint. That was slightly annoying to deal with."
"5.0","Good fresh chicken but it is hot! Order a spice down from what you would usually get at an American restaurant. The fries are good but I do think the mac and cheese is a little bland. The fruit cup is good too and you can get orders to go very easily and they come in cute boxes. They serve beer here too!"
"4.0","I am staying at the Marriott property down the street from this restaurant.  I enjoy when you can find a decent meal within walking distance of where I am staying. Tonight the Patriots are playing so I wanted a venue that would offer a healthy fare and televisions to watch the game. Red Beards offers this! I started with the chips, salsa and queso appetizer. The chips had the right amount of salt. The queso was a unique flavor and I really enjoyed  it! The salsa was more like a pico and was very fresh. I ordered the beef taco salad and was extremely pleased. The dressing was spicy on the tongue but flavorful. The presentation was very colorful and appealing.I picked off the jalape√±os because I am not able to stomach those but they made it look really pretty. I ordered a cocktail from the menu which has pineapple juice and rum. It made me feel like I was in the Caribbean as I watched the patriots play. The person next to me ordered the French onion soup who said it was good. There were plenty of onions and broth. They also ordered the steak hoagie and they devoured it! It was full of meat but not a messy sandwich. Megan W. was my waitress and she was timely, efficient and very sweet. She met every request without hesitation or delay. The establishment is clean and comfortable. If I return to Pittsburgh I will definitely come back here! I recommend this place!"
"4.0","I'm giving this place 4 stars because of the delicious oysters we had last night (Tuesday's are still half price so you get 12/$15).  I really, really want to like this place...  I love the concept, I love the fact that the original & still flourishing Wholeys is right down the street, I LOVE the fact that on every occasion that we have been there- Luke was greeting guests...  BUT their service (at least the regular bartender service) is quite slow and very inattentive.  There are about 20 seats at the bar and there were maybe 6 people sitting there when we sat down.  It took the 'cooler' of the 2 bartenders over 5 minutes to step over to ask us, 'You wanna see menu's...?'  Like, how about 'Can I get you guys a drink while you check out the menu...?'  After-all, we WERE sitting at the bar.  We sat down at 6:30 and happy hour was going on till 7.  We were handed menu's and he walked away.  We weren't told of the HH specials until we asked the 'friendlier' bartender.  The oysters aren't even listed on the menu- I could understand if they were listed w/o pricing or with a caveat that said 'These are some of the types we offer, depending on the season and the fisherman's 'haul...'  The service finally improved when the 'bar manager' stepped behind the bar and started serving the full bar.  I don't know what the other 2 guys did while he was serving but they almost blended into the background.  The manager was very friendly & knowledgeable, making suggestions when people asked about beers & wines...  I just don't know if those other 2 were pulled from being servers and told they had to tend bar for the night or what, but they just seemed like they were uninterested in being there... As for the oysters- we had originally ordered the Blue Points but after waiting about a half hour- the bartender came over to tell us that they were out of Blue Points and he suggested we substitute the St. James River oysters.  They arrived about 5 minutes later- complete with a cocktail sauce & horseradish.  They were delicious...!  The owners- Mr Robert Wholey is about the friendliest guy you're going to meet.  He stopped to talk, told us a little about the restaurant, invited us up to see his art gallery (which we declined ONLY because we were afraid we'd lose our seats at the bar).  He stopped at every table- he would be a favorite of Jon Taffer's (from Bar Rescue).  And his son- Luke... he's also as friendly as his dad and he stopped to talk about the restaurant, his favorite muskie fishing baits & areas, etc.  These guys are a class act and that's why I love this place..."
"3.0","While I agree with most other reviews, that this is the best Chinese restaurant downtown, I definitely don't think it is anywhere near five stars.Nice atmosphere, like a darkened velvety place you would find in Chinatown, NYC.The food, however, is basically the same as any small-town corner joint.  Their 'spicy' items lack any heat whatsoever.  I requested that my last meal be 'extra spicy,' and the receipt verified the order, but there was zero heat in the 'House Special Spicy Crispy Chicken.'  I will say that I was impressed with the fried rice that came with the meal.  Unlike most places, they included bamboo shoots, veggies and egg.  The fried rice was an easy 5 stars.  That's about it."
"5.0","The food is great. Very expensive but that's what you are opting in when you book in a 5 star restaurant. Had the ribeye and the tenderloin with lobster. The balsamic vinegar cost on the ribeye was the highlight of the dinner. Lobster bisque was fantastic but when has lobster bisque ever not be :)"
"3.0","I stopped at Fernando's during lunch time on a Friday.  It was bustling like many of the places downtown during lunch.  There was a line like expected, but it moved very efficiently and the people behind the counter were direct, but not in any way rude.  They ask if you want all the normal toppings in a nice way and didn't seem to mind many people not wanting different toppings.  The place was tidy and what'd you expect out of a sandwich shop.Now the food.  They have a daily lunch specials that make a sandwich a 'meal' by adding a fountain drink and a bag of Herr's chips.  I ordered the Sante Fe Steak Taco wrap and allowed them to put everything on it that they normally do -- tomatoes, black olives, mild peppers, lettuce, steak, and cheese.  Next time I think I will opt for jalapenos.  The wrap was toasted, but was really soggy and did not end up looking anything like the pictured wrap, man that pictured wrap looked so toasty and delicious.  My wrap was good don't get me wrong, but I was hoping for more.  It was a good size for a good price and they throw in any dipping sauce you want, I got their house Southwestern.  I really liked what I saw from the subs coming out for other people, so I will go to Fernando's again soon and grab a sub.  Maybe I'll even update update my rating.  Again it's losing stars only for the sogginess.  Go check out Fernando's to replace your Subway or Jimmy John's sub.***Edit***Ordered the Bacon Beef and Cheddar toasted sub.  It was good, but again just not great.  I still prefer Fernando's over DiBellas, Jimmy Johns, and Subway as far as sub places downtown.  It just falls short when stacked up against other sub places."
"1.0","They close at 8:00 PM.  I was in line at 7:35 PM to order one lamb kabob.  The customer ahead of me took 10 minutes to figure out what he and his friend wanted.  By the time I was able to order it was 7:47 PM and when I tried to place my lamb kabob order I was told that the grill is closed.  I tried to explain to him that I was in line for a long time and he was like, 'no the grill is closed'.  Ironically or rather to add insult to injury, the 'Mr. disregard to all customers in line' (customer who took forever to order) must have ordered about 10 grill items because as I was being told that I couldn't get any grilled items, they were placing about 10 kabob items on the grill!  They should specify that the grill closes earlier and not only that be more considerate of customer waiting in line.  It's not great customer service when your telling me that the grill is closed but you're about to put a million skewers of raw meat on the grill.  Not planning to go back."
"1.0","Truly the worst Panera Bread you will ever visit. The only thing that is good here are the bagels and baked goods (which I'm pretty sure are the same at every Panera). I have had salads here that every single leaf of lettuce inside was dead/wilted/rotten, One time I was actually given a sandwich that had a hole in the bread....an actual hole as if someone took the middle of the bread out. Bizarre! The only reason this place is still in business is because they have a nice seating area and it is one of the only restaurants available on Pitt's campus. This location also has mice....."
"3.0","Whenever we eat in, it's been great. Every time we get take out though, something gets missed! Usually it's just sauce, but I was super bummed today to be missing a side of mac and cheese for the second time out of a handful of times we've gotten take out.Guess we should have learned by now to check our boxes before leaving with our food.I've also noticed the past few times we've gone, the chicken is less and less heavily seasoned, which is what distinguishes Nashville style hot chicken from just regular spicy tenders. And this also means less spicy. My bf got the medium tenders today and found them quite mild, while my hot tenders were less spicy than the medium used to be.The chicken itself was still tasty, but I hope the heat can be cranked up again - being able to get legitimately HOT chicken is what makes this place really unique. Also, I'll definitely check my food before taking it to go from now on, but hopefully some kind of system can be worked out to avoid forgetting parts of orders as often."
"5.0","Amazing chicken. I got the southern style and my husband got the mild because we read the reviews here saying the medium was super hot. I wish I would have started with mild and probably could have went with medium too no problem. Mild had a very very slight kick. Sandwiches are good but wish I would have gone with the strips because those were amazing. The fries were surprisingly crispy which was good because the pictures here look under cooked. They look that way in the restaurant too but they're perfect coming from someone who overcooks fries and tots for maximum crispness. I'm looking forward to my next visit."
"2.0","Setting: 1:10 on a Tuesday afternoon. They close at 2:30pm and reopen later for dinner. I got a lunch special with a friend, which consisted of Tom Yum soup and a spring roll. The soup was unexpectedly spicy, slightly more than maybe a teaspoon of Sriracha. Spring roll was okay. They brought the lunch out within 5 minutes of bringing the appetizer out! But it was quite spicy to me (I got a 4 out of 10 on the spice scale). Of course, we're talking authentic Thai food. So it probably would have been more delicious to me if I was more spice oriented. I ordered the Chiang Mai Mee, which seemed to be coconut milk based, and much more sweet than I wished is was. This is how authentic Thai is made, apparently, so I suppose I'm more a fan of Americanized Thai. My friend's experience was subpar. She ordered a few dishes for her colleagues from the office, which were made quickly. But one of the dishes was incorrect (noodle dish instead of the rice dish my friend ordered), and waitress asked if we could come back later (probably around the dinner time, since it was already 2:20) to pick up the correct dish. At this point, my friend asked if they could just remake the one they made incorrectly, to which the waitress replied, 'Hey, we make mistakes too.' My friend didn't get the dish that she wanted, and she's not planning on returning. Overall, an average place to eat, but the waitress's attitude was uncalled for. They absolutely should have remade that dish for free. If you want authentic Thai food (and have the stomach for the spiciness), then you might enjoy this place."
"4.0","Great atmosphere.. Went on a Friday night and they had a live dj playing good hip hop.. The skewers were delicious especially the Wagyu, the karaage fried chicken was to dry but the gravy was delicious.. Def going back but I am gonna stick to tapas next time..."
"5.0","My girlfriend and I had come here expecting a great dinner and we got just that. Our waiter James did a well job explaining the menu to us and even recommended differed items. The filet was wonderful and I would put it above other places in the city. We will definitely be returning soon requesting James."
"5.0","I thoroughly enjoyed this cafe. The atmosphere is very cozy and very French. Loved all the details in regards to decor. I ordered the Mediterranean omelet it was delicious. I also ordered their chai tea latte which was great as well. I recommend if you're in the area."
"5.0","Since the move, Cafe Raymond is a go to destination for the best eats in the Strip.  They have the best the strip has to offer then cranked up the volume which the prices reflect that at an acceptable level.  What keeps me returning to a restaurant is that one good item, a diverse menu that takes me to a different place with each visit or a good deal, aka cheap.  Cafe Raymond has the diverse menu I plan to travel through on each visit.  They also have a great special every day that is not on the menu which is always a great detour.  I also love the counter ordering, makes lunch visits so much more efficient and you are not worrying about paying the bill while you enjoy your meal.  I also feel that this is one of those places that if there is something you usually do not like, you will like it here, basically there is not a bad thing on the menu."
"5.0","Saw this truck at yArt and tried a vegetarian taco that had mushrooms and potatoes with lettuce, tomato and onion. Sooo good! I've never had mushrooms that tasted like that. It had a kick and a good flavor. I wish I could figure out how to recreate it with spices! The corn shells were not overly thick, hard or rubbery. They were perfect.The people on the food truck were lovely. They had 4 types of salsa, forks and napkins readily available. I added the medium salsa to a portion of my taco, and it went very well with it. I hope I see this truck around again sometime!"
"2.0","I'm so sad this place didn't work out for me as the employee I interacted with was very nice. I ordered a falafel panini and side of mac and cheese to go. It was ready when I arrived but they forgot my mac and cheese so I had to wait in the non-AC building on a 90% humidity day. But... I didn't have to wait that long because I am 99.999% sure the mac and cheese is actually Stouffers. Stouffers mac & cheese has an iconic flavor to it, pretty hard to duplicate, and is just something you recognize when it hits your lips. The falafel panini came with pesto. I should have realized that those two flavor profiles would not be complimentary. Ugh. I couldn't finish it. The only redeeming parts were their french fries and price point.... The fries were flavored well with a food consistency."
"1.0","Great bar.  Horrible treatment by one of the bartenders.  Rude and disrespectful.  I hope that the owner reads this."
"3.0","Food was pretty good - we had the farmhouse burger, kielbasa, and street tacos. That said, it was a bit overpriced for what you get, especially the beer - 2 IPAs for $20 is just a little steep for me. Worth checking out for the men's bathroom experience alone - leave it to the Bus for that one. Good, but I'm not sure I'd visit this restaurant twice."
"3.0","So I was not happy that we ended up here but that quickly changed once I got my food. I'm a sucker for chicken fingers and they had the best honey mustard EVER!! And inexpensive as well. So if you in the Burgh and it's late and everything else is closed this wont disappoint."
"4.0","I love the idea of a spot that served Japanese street food up until late night, and Umami did not disappoint.  Entering the restaurant was an experience by itself, as it's upstairs on the 3rd floor of the building that Round Corner Cantina is located.  The red lighting both on the way up and inside the restaurant itself gave it a surreal vibe that I thought was really cool.The menu is basically set up as shareable and small sized plates.  The Robotayaki skewers were alright, but the items that shined for me were the larger plates, namely the Nash Shigiyaki (eggplant) and the Karaage (fried chicken).  Both were larger in portion than I expected and absolutely tasty in their own regard.  I wish I would have been more in the mood to eat here, as I was looking forward to place for weeks until 60s weather in February came around and day drinking happened.  Really looking forward to going back with a clearer mind and a larger appetite.  It is such a cool spot with a fun menu and highly recommended to those looking for a unique dining experience."
"5.0","Through the years I have been to Alexander's Italian Bistro for private gatherings, lunch, dinner, and just meeting a friend for drinks.Although I was born and raised in Pittsburgh, I live in Alexandria, VA. This restaurant is my 'go to' place if I want great food with great friends.    Kelly took my order and said 'NO PROBLEM' when I asked if they would prepare a large order of food. I wanted to send dinners to the police officers processing the crime site following murders at Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh.  Luckily, my friend could pick it up and deliver it to the precinct.       It made my day that Alexander's were able to understand what was being requested and whipped up a huge dinner (soup to nuts) and that my friend was willing and able to run it to the police.       Nothing finer than ensuring those who protect and serve are having good, soli meals during a trying time."
"3.0","Interesting place...different than most restaurants. Decor is nice, service was acceptable. Pizza was very good, but was overpriced. Probably wasn't worth the money. I doubt I'd go there again."
"5.0","Food was very good a good amount for a very low price it was my first time. I will definitely go back when I am in Pittsburgh."
"5.0","Amazing! You wouldn't expect this much from a little taco stand but their food is absolutely delicious. You order your tacos and then they have a little cold cart w condiments that you can add to your tacos. Even if you don't want to eat a full meal, at least try to stop for one. Edgar's used to be on the corner of Casa Reyna but they moved up the street and now have a small truck in a parking lot. If you go further up the street you will come to their tiny shop. Their hot sauce is amazing and their pickled veggies add a good crunch to the tacos."
"4.0","Went to Grille 36 last night in Pittsburgh.  A nice big sports bar near the stadium.  Decent beer selection, decent food, very good service from LynnAnn.  The place is nicely decorated with tvs everywhere to watch all the sports you want.  The bar is lively and fun. We ate in the more mellow back section with our own TV. That was cool. The food was decent.  My first fried deviled eggs.  They were pretty tasty.  The salad was big but the lettuce was wilty.  The adult grilled cheese w tater tots was pretty good.  Despite being in the back we were constantly checked on by our server.  She made us feel right at home even though I live 3000 miles away."
"4.0","Great addition to the Penn Ave corridor of Garfield. I'd never made it to their former shop on Centre (Everyday's A Sundae) and was bummed when they closed. So very happy to have them in our neighborhood.The food  is so tasty from the Belgian waffles and French toast to breakfast sandwiches and everything in between.They make a really good cup of coffee too.Service is exceptional. Owner Natalie is fantastic.This truly  is one of those wonderful little city neighborhood spots that's sure to make me a regular.Open for brekkie and lunch.All of the sandwiches and entrees are made to order. Can build your own sandwich or choose from a signature sandwich menu.Prices are beyond reasonable and in some cases half the price of similar cafes. Super delicious food and excellent value."
"4.0","Gluten free pizzas are hard to find in this city. I ordered over the phone and the pizza was ready in ten minutes. It was fast, cheap, and easy. I'm grateful there's a place that sells gluten free pizza in Lawrenceville!"
"4.0","This place is very classy. The food is also decent. Capital Grille is a chain throughout the United States however, it does not feel like a chain at all. I've only been to the Pittsburgh location and it exemplifies sophistication. The interior is very dim and gives me cigar den or speakeasy vibes. There are some taxidermy and portraits of famous Pittsburghers that line the walls. The customer service is also very good here. The person that helped my table was very kind and knowledgeable of the food.The food is good. I only say good because I was not particularly wowed by anything I ate. Maybe this place is too sophisticated for me, I'm more into inventive modern dishes compared to classics. Everything I ate was good and perfectly seasoned and cooked. The options are limited and there are not many fun, inventive dishes. Although, if you are looking for good quality classics- this place is for you."
"3.0","Had the falafel panini which was decent but nothing exceptional. The place was completely empty when I walked in and there was no one in the front to take my order. There was one guy in the back who saw me after 5 minutes of waiting, and he said he'll be there in a few. It took another 5 minutes before he walked over to the cash register and at this point I was pretty close to leaving and going somewhere else. Even after I ordered, it took a while to get my food. Overall, it was a very slow process and the employees/owners didn't seem to care about their customers. Not planning on coming back anytime soon."
"5.0","Amazing is not enough. The drinks were amazing very well done Manhattan. Me and my friend went down the drink menu they were all fantastic. Favorite was the orange Julius Cesar. The meat and local cheese plate were amazing choices. The octopi pizza was amazing. The flavored on that were insane between the olives and octopus and squid was amazing."
"5.0","Love! I'm a huge Ruth's Chris fan but Capital never disappoints. Celebrated my bachelorette party there and was treated like royalty. So sweet!"
"1.0","This is probably the worst experience I've ever had in a restaurant. Outside of the server, everything else was absolute trash. The morning shift didn't clean a damn thing on their way out the door. Left everything a mess for the dinner shift to handle. Unprofessional. What's worse is that it was slow and yet no one decided to clean. People were coming in for their shifts just standing around gossiping at the host stand. There were flies and moths flying around. We sat next to a dirty table the whole time we were there and we were there for an hour. That table was still dirty when we left. My sister ordered a burger cooked medium. What she actually got was medium-well to well done. I ordered a chicken sandwich which was a chore to chew. We came to Pittsburgh to see the baseball game and to come to this restaurant. I'm not sure who Jerome has running this place but I'm never coming back. This place is in a prime location and with his name attached to it, you'd think it'd be better run."
"5.0","Even at $20,  the brunch special is a value. The fruit was fresh and piled high. The chef's riff on the cheese steak was one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten. The nutella and banana crepe made me happy. The staff were super friendly, the coffee was good. Everything here made me happy."
"3.0","Way overpriced!!!  $10 for a field greens salad and it sure wasn't field greens. !!!  It's so dark in the restraunt that we had to use the light from our cell phones to read the menu!   but the kicker was that they asked what we were celebrating and it was for birthday and anniversary...  They bring out 2 dessert plates one for each - but only one was complimentary... Which is fine... But they should've asked if we wanted 2 and that only one was free. Probably won't be back"
"5.0","After receiving poor service at Jamba Juice a few doors down, I really wanted to try this place. I went in on a whim one afternoon and LOVED it. The atmosphere was so inviting and on theme. The employees were very friendly, service was quick, line was organized, and my smoothie was delicious. If I weren't a college student, I would so come here more often and try everything (lack of funds). I'll be back soon!"
"5.0","Best Bloody Mary in Pittsburgh! Amazing restaurant in the Strip District, we stop every time we go down town"
"5.0","#7 is an absolute must try when visiting Pittsburgh!! The spicy sausage gives it an extra kick that makes you wanting more. Great bread, great flavor, and great ambience.  Very low key place that let's you enjoy your sub. Highly recommend!!!  If we ever come back to Pittsburgh, we are definitely coming to Peppi's."
"1.0","Oh..where to start, have been here two years before and was decent but it has gone down the drain now. We had flies buzzing around..one fly flew into the water glass. Yuck!!Also, very Poor service. Didnt check back EVEN once during our meal.Missing ingredients in Oothappam, a simple south indian dish. Refused to fix the dish..or offer anything in reduction.Also they sat us near to the bathroom/kitchen area although many othet tables were open.Sorry, not going here again!"
"5.0","The restaurant was nice and quiet. We waited patiently for our food and it was well worth the wait! I ordered the bread twist, which was a very large size so it was perfect for me and it was amazing! The texture, taste, everything was perfection!!! I definitely finished the entire thing."
"5.0","It was so hard to pick just a few item from this gem hidden in the Strip District of Pittsburg. We went full game on the Lobsterfest menu and enjoyed every bit of it! Having lived in CT and enjoying my share of lobster and all things seafood, I have to say I was quite impressed! Prices were also hard to beat!"
"5.0","The whole experience was wonderful. I was a little worried when we got there because we asked to be seated somewhere else and the hostess was definitely not happy about it. When we pay good money for a meal I expect the best of service. Our waiter, Travis, was the best. Very knowledgeable and courteous. I would love to have him again when we return. We had their speciality pineapple vodka soaked cocktail. Delicious. We ordered two appetizers, the crab cakes and calamari with spicy peppers. Both tasted wonderful. I would suggest eating the crab cakes first because the peppers from the calamari slightly took over my palate. The bread basket they served was elegant and the butter very fresh and tasty. Dinner was tenderloin with lobster tail with two sides of creamed corn and bacon and the roasted mushrooms. Simple, tasty, and went well with the meat. We finished off the evening with coffee (was SO happy it was piping hot and strong) and dessert, flourless chocolate espresso cake and the coconut cream cake! Both were absolutely to die for, and a must have. Great evening."
"2.0","Panera is a go to stop for me when I use my Panera rewards and have a craving for a pick 2. You have parking available around the location but can easily walk from one of the nearby hotels or hospital. The location is large and have a good amount of sitting room.The customer service was good the food was below average at best. I went for the Turkey BLT & Chicken Apple salad pick 2. The food came after 3-4 minutes. It was obvious after the first bite the food wasn't fresh. The chicken was partially frozen along with the lettuce on both my sandwich and salad. My side of an apple was delicious though!"
"1.0","I went to this place for a lunch buffet on a Saturday.Everything from the appetizers to the dessert was stale, probably a few days old. The quality was pathetic and had a lot of potential to make you really sick. The Naan was visibly stale, let alone the taste of it. I shall not go there again."
"4.0","This is their newest location in downtown Pittsburgh on Forbes across from the Tower at PNC.  There are about 10 tiny tables in this tiny location, but enough for people that want lunch and want to sit.  I came in around 12:30 on a Wednesday and there were still empty seats.  The counter was laden with spectacular looking pastries and breads.  I wanted to grab something to bring back to the office and share, so I had them put in a variety of macarons and these little tiny cakes that I was told were pistachio and raspberry. The little cakes were amazing.  The macarons are perfectly flavored and very buttery.  For 5 of each, the total came to less than 8 bucks which is pretty incredible for this place.  I definitely want to come back and try the he macarons.  Bluebird Kitchen down the street has some of the best, so La Gourmandine has some competition in the area, but it's a welcome addition to the downtown food landscape."
"4.0","Fast service, clean restaurant, like most Subways I have been to.$5 foot long is genius marketing and a great deal around the world."
"5.0","Cinderlands has such a warm vibe. I had the Pork Schnitzel Sandwich. It was a huge portion and absolutely delicious. I would definitely get it again. My friend had the roasted brussel sprouts and loved them! The staff was very knowledgeable and helped me choose a beer. I had the bog whipper which was really good, it was fruit forward and I really enjoyed it. My friend enjoyed the midnight rambler. Great experience, would go back soon."
"1.0","The setting is very nice but the security staff are incredibly disrespectful and unpleasant. The service was slow and every dish was too salty."
"5.0","Before I review the restaurant and experience, I want to give a special shout out to our waiter, George. George is perhaps the friendliest waiter I've ever had the pleasure of having. He was kind, attentive, and had a wonderful sense of humor. Despite being extremely busy and waiting many, many tables, he still found time to not only take a few minutes to talk to us, but also to leave a hand-written note on our bill. George, if you read this, thank you again for the wonderful evening of service!!!Where to begin? Grille 36 has always been a favorite of mine, but I don't often get down there because the parking situation on the North Shore is always a big tenuous. As my girlfriend had never been there and as we were both in the mood for sandwiches from somewhere different, we decided to brave the Pitt game day parking situation and give it a shot.We were seated within minutes of arriving even though it was busy, which I thought was excellent as it was clear there were many people watching the second half of the game and lingering. Our server, as stated above, was wonderful from beginning to end and was probably the best we've ever had. I ordered the BBQ Bacon burger, which was cooked perfectly and had a wonderful blend of flavors. The fries were also excellent. My girlfriend had the Blackened Fish sandwich and she was very pleasantly surprised as well. We also took George's advice and tried the deep fried pretzels, which were one of the better appetizers we've had while eating out. The queso and mustard dipping sauces were very flavorful. We topped off our dinner with a slice of the carrot cake, which was enormous. We split it in half and still ended up with some to take home! You get a lot of value for what you pay and the selection is quite wide. We'll definitely be back!"
"4.0","This is one cool place.  Awesome meal and awesome service!  We sat in the side room with these cool tables where you have to step down into the seats.  Love the atmosphere and the food presentation was gorgeous.  Great sake and really enjoyed the meal.  We ordered all the dishes to share - make sure you leave room for dessert - so good!"
"1.0","I had such high hopes for this place. The online menu seems amazing with so many delicious brunch options ranging from sweet to savory. Despite some of the negative reviews given to this place, I thought maybe I'll get luckier. However, my experience was a complete disaster. The location is great, right on a main street. The caf√© is spacious with plenty of lighting. However, they did not make very good use of the space. The d√©cors were all over place with Christmas, spring and summer themes going on at the same time. The service was awful as well. The server was inattentive, rude when we asked for an extra minute to look over the menu and he mixed up our order when the food came out.The food took exactly 40 minutes to arrive to our table. There were only two occupied tables in the entire caf√© so there should be no excuse for taking that long. I ordered the Caffe Crepe with chicken, apples, avocado and melted brie. The chicken was overcooked and super bland with no seasoning at all. There were no avocados in my crepe. The only thing I could taste was the brie. The crepe was so horrible and tasteless that I could not finish it. Each bite was a complete struggle and I had to fight to keep my food down. The food was bad. The service was bad. The experience was overall bad. I am ashamed for bringing my dining companions here. Caffe Mona, never again."
"4.0","This is a very nice local Liberty Avenue joint in Bloomfield. The food is relatively affordable and tastes very fresh. The options for dishes are somewhat limited as a vegetarian since they do limited seasonal dishes, but I am always able to find something and I always leave very satisfied. Consistent joint and you can't go wrong."
"4.0","Went here for my birthday dinner and it was wonderful! The menu is a bit confusing to read, I definitely recommend asking your server for help. I also suggest that you order a few items to share as this feels very dim sum/tapas style. We ordered the chirashi bowl and all pieces were great and fresh) the salmon a bit disappointing however, not as soft as I'd like for it to be). The octopus balls were also wonderful and definitely unique! My favorite may have been the pork belly skewer, however. Also, the cocktails were so cute and creative! All in all, the piece at the end felt very reasonable to. While ordering it seems quite pricey but you really do get the best bang for your buck if you share plates!"
"3.0","I just don't know if any restaurateur is going to make it work here. First, this place was 'Roasted' and it was in business for about a year or so. The overall seating arrangement is odd. It's like half speakeasy, half dining area.Service: There is maybe only one other time that I've felt as rushed by a bartender as I did last night. First off, the place wasn't even that busy on a Friday at 8:30. My friend and I ordered a couple of drinks and I got some pierogis. I finished up my plate, got a box, but my friend was still drinking. He brings the checks...we don't put our cards in them. He comes back 5 minutes later and says 'i put these here for you ladies'. Yep, we can see them, thanks! Food: the pierogis were good! Very flavorful and with the pickled onions it was a nice touch. Drink: I had a whiskey apple shrub which was very tasty. I also had the passionfruit Weisse and... no ma'am... will not get that again.Overall, meh. I could take this place or leave it."
"4.0","Salem's Market & Grill was quick, fairly reasonably priced, and tasty. There are lots of options and the meat looked and tasted pretty fresh. We ordered a nan shawarma and chicken shawarma and we enjoyed both of them."
"4.0","The good: really really cute outdoor seating, fast service, and good food. I had the Philly steak crepe and enjoyed it although I feel like it was missing something like an egg or maybe some type of sauce or drizzle of something and my boyfriend had the turkey bagel. For dessert we got a strawberry Nutella crepe that I guess also came with blueberries. I also had a latte and double shot of espresso. All was good, however the water situation was weird. You have to pay for water and you only get a little Kirkland bottle with like 6 oz in it. It just struck me as strange and not very eco friendly, I hope they recycle. The other thing was, while it was not crowded while we were there, the outdoor seating is really smushed together and if it was busier we would have been sitting right on top of another person."
"5.0","These aren't just the best burgers in Lawrenceville, but in all of Pittsburgh! I've tried most of their specialty burgers, and love them all. Their fried chicken sandwiches are also as good as it gets! Their house brewed beer is tasty (though not the best in Lawrenceville, but I'm not reviewing for that.) Great lunch stop!"
"5.0","We have come here a number of times for weekend breakfast and had a fantastic experience every time. This is one of our favorite breakfast sandwiches in the city and they also have amazing vegan/vegetarian options. The staff is also wonderful!"
"5.0","Had some great vegetarian tacos ( hard to find good ones with fake meat). The tacos were very well seasoned. Had a vegetarian burrito as well, which again were very fresh and well seasoned. Would definitely come back."
"4.0","Neat little cafe--good sandwiches, friendly owners, and lots of desserts. The Da Vinci sandwich was an inexpensive and quite filling lunch option and paired well with a strawberry lemonade. Will go for the ice cream next time as per their name!"
"4.0","This is very nice caf√©.The coffee is fantastic. It's strong & has a lot of good flavorThe caf√© crepe was good. It could have a little more flavor in it. But I would give it four out of five.The bacon chicken sandwich was very good with the exception of the chicken being kind of dry. I would give the sandwiches three out of five and probably choose something different next time I go.Besides all of that came with the sandwich in the crate we're good they had balsamic vinegar rat on them.The price was a little expensive for what we got. I was also little disappointed to find out that they did not have tapwater and we got charged for half size bottles of water.Overall the experience was pretty good the staff was friendly and attentive environment was nice. We will definitely be back."
"5.0","I frequently visit the Pamela's in the strip, but this was my first trip to this one.  It's the same great food.  I love Gail's eggs and the crepe pancakes.  The restaurant is smaller than the strip one.  It's clean and the staff were friendly.  You must try it!  Bring your cash, because it's cash only."
"4.0","Sausilido (a mix between Sausalito the place and Lido, the owners grandfather) is a new bistro in Bloomfield. They opened up in October of '08 and are already basically reservation only during peak weekend dinner times. The customer service is wonderful, as is the quality of food and the presentation. We had the smoked Gouda for an appetizer. I'm not the biggest fan of smoked Gouda, but it was good, and prepared well. But the app was served with a delicious, perfectly prepared sauteed spinach salad. Needless to say, Sausalido takes care of the details. And they offer fresh ground pepper for your salad, and fresh ground Parmesan for your pasta, which is something I've never encountered in Pgh, not even at Eleven. My friend got a special, it was steak with potatoes and vegetables (it was more fancy then that, of course). He was very pleased with his food. I had the bechamel lasagna and it was great, but REALLY rich.The place is BYOB with a small per person (not per bottle) cork fee. I think it's $2. It's by far one of the better dining experiences that I've had in Pittsburgh, and it's well above most of the other restaurants in Bloomfield."
"5.0","Outstanding in every way! We decided with somewhat short notice to have a food truck at our summer picnic.  Mike was so nice to work with. He showed up and set up right on time and he served all of our guests with great professionalism and efficiency. The food was delicious and he cooked for hours for us.  We were completely happy with the food, service, and having the BullDawg's food truck at our party was a complete hit!"
"5.0","I was super impressed with this place between the food and drinks. We went for a work happy hour which turned into a 5 hour stay! We ended up trying a lot of their drinks and food, so here's my thoughts...The menu is small but comprehensive. There's something for everyone - from the classic, juicy burger or melt-in-your-mouth short ribs to the flavorful octopus and hush puppy dish. Then there's the ode to Pittsburgh's ancestral roots with perfectly seared pierogi and a haluski and kielbasa dish. The haluski was amazing and I don't like kielbasa but it was a hit with my friends. It was gorgeous and smelled so good - not something I say about kielbasa often. I do have to say that our table's favorite dish ended up being the chicharones - spent grain fried up and served with cheese. Light and crunchy deliciousness with cheese... Yes please. I was so happy that they serve spirits and wine at this brewery since I don't like beer. The rum punch is my new favorite drink in all of Pittsburgh. So dang yummy. They also serve R Winery wines, as well as local whiskey. My husband really liked their double IPA while our friends enjoyed their sour beer. Such a great new staple brewery in a great location."
"1.0","Wonton soup tastes gross like they never change the soup in the pot. There's nothing inside the wonton. Worst wonton I have ever eaten. Sweet and sour chicken is wayyyyy too sweet to me. Yuk."
"4.0","Ah, Eat n' Park. They are consistently... open. What is notable here is the complete and utter absence of hipsters, posers, snobs, or any sort of pretension whatsoever. What you find at Eat 'n Park instead are Pittsburgh's blue collar families, senior citizens, and teenagers out for an inexpensive meal at a surprisingly high-quality local diner chain. The 'super burger' is basically a Big Mac without all the grease,  and is actually quite satisfying. The salad bar is always fresh and kept well stocked (well, sometimes the customers manage to fish out all the chicken and noodles from the chicken noodle soup, leaving only the broth). The service is top-notch, with friendly waitstaff who could teach the waiters and waitresses at some of the more expensive fine dining establishments the area a thing or two about customer service.And, they have pie."
"5.0","Modern, rustic atmosphere with excellent food! Mezzo is the middle floor at Sienna Mercato in Pittsburgh's Cultural District. We stopped here with reservations before a show at the Benedum. It is a very quick and easy walk. It wasn't too busy on a Thursday evening but there was still a great atmosphere. We were greeted promptly by our waitress and provided with a run down of the specials. Being obsessed with pizza, we were already leaning that way; however, there was a special pizza that sounded AMAZING: peaches, ricotta, red onion, oil, andouille sausage, and rosemary. I obviously opted for this and my husband ordered the Parmesan & Peppers. Both were delicious but the special was outstanding. I hope they add it to the menu! The dough and crust were perfectly crunchy and flavorful. Also, the pizzas are really good size! We each ordered our own but were very full! I would say you could split one if you get appetizers."
"4.0","Stopped by after a couple hours at the Heinz museum. Very good sandwiches! Would stop in again when visiting Pittsburgh!"
"2.0","This is one of the worst Indian food I've had in a while. I went there for the dinner buffet and started with the appetizers. The pakoras were too dry. They had no taste in them. The chicken biryani was basically uncooked rice with small pieces of unsavory chicken. And the Tandoori chicken had an unusual smell to it. Coming to the main course: The chicken tikka masala had a rubber-like texture. The saag and the malai kofta, even though had rich gravy, had practically the same taste (too buttery). The chicken curry was good. The only thing I really liked about the food was the dessert. They had mango ice cream, kheer and gulab jamun. Conclusion: If you guys want to taste authentic Indian food, avoid this place! This will leave a bad taste in your mouth. It does not justify the $12 ($10 on student ID) price tag. I would not go there again. Also, my two stars for this place is solely because of the desserts."
"5.0","Gabriel was fantastic , polite and attentive. He made our time there super fun! He was very personable and kept us laughing!"
"5.0","Absolutely delicious! Holy cow, lobster bisque fries! Amazing shrimp scampi (and I'm super picky) with meaty shrimps. Loved it all and the staff is super nice."
"4.0","I was so pleased to grab lunch here after viewing their menu options. There really is something for everyone. I had a veggie wrap and it came in a spinach wrap with a pesto sauce. I cannot express to you how fresh this tasted (after further review, we discovered they make their bread fresh daily)!  The line moved quickly and we were able to grab a table in front of the kitchen. I enjoyed how the inside was set-up and every employee was smiling and friendly. One thing I personally did not like was that my wrap came with Ruffles potato chips. It's a slight pet peeve of mine when delis do this. It's as though you're presenting this amazing meal that's fresh and delicious and you can't do any better than chips. From a bag. It's a desperate cry for help, in my opinion. But I digress....also for my side I was given a delicious pickle. My wrap came with a side salad as well (which came out so fast!), which included a beautiful, homemade lemon vinaigrette on the side. The coffee I added is organic, which was an added bonus for me, and water cups are free with the option of lemon. Breakfast options are available too. I can't wait to come back here- it really hit the spot."
"5.0","We are a big family with a member in hospice...So it was a big order with some special instructions...We were starving, needed something delivered, found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try...And were glad we did!!The delivery was fast, the order was spot on accurate, and the food was fantastic!!!Most of us had burgers, one fried chicken sandwich, and a couple of hot dogs...Sides were fries, perogies, and side salads...Everything was delicious!!! Not one complaint on the food from 8 people!And that is a miracle with this family...Will definitely stop and eat there in the future!Thank you for making a very hard time a little less horrible!!!"
"4.0","Stopped by here for dinner yesterday evening after walking around the Three Rivers Art festival. My date actually recommended their pizzas and that's what I got! I got the duck speck pizza and it was pretty freaking delicious. The duck was so good and the pizza was a pretty decent size. Crust was perfectly toasted!My date got the choose three option. The fried calamari was really good. The shrimp fra diavlo was okay. We got the fallen chocolate souffl√© cake and it was to die for! Super delicious, I had to stop myself from eating the whole thing...Service was really good! She was very attentive to us and super nice. She did a really good job. I hope to come here again in the future! This restaurant is a lil pricey for a poor recently graduated college student, but it's definitely worth a try or for a special occasion. (Food photo creds to my date - HAHA)"
"5.0","I had Maggie's Farm burger, it was excellent. Meat was fresh & delicious, gluten-free bun was surprisingly good. Decor is retro casual. Very pleased with 1st visit."
"1.0","The blueberry pancake was not good. The outside was sort of burnt. The staff were not friendly! I don't recommend the place for parties bigger than 8 even with reservation. You have to arrive about 45 minutes early, otherwise you spend most of the time in line and they ask you out in less than an hour.  They even did not bring my friend's food and he had to ask for a refund!"
"2.0","Disappointed. Everything (white pizza and breadsticks) was very, very bland. The spinach topping is just bagged frozen spinach for a whole $2.50 extra."
"5.0","Great selection, spicy, and incredible.Very friendly and accommodating staff. Very nice atmosphere as well. Parking is slightly difficult but they do have some assigned space. Highly recommended."
"5.0","Wow what a fantastic experience here! They were extremely accommodating for our last minute large group on a Friday night. We got a table right away. Service was excellent and beer was top notch. The food we got was super good, I loved the spent grains (really innovative idea) and the spicy friend chicken sandwich was very juicy and spiced just right. The pickles were also on point! The open kitchen was really cool, they were working so hard to make every dish perfect. Overall we really appreciated the modern atmosphere combined with great beer and excellent service. We will be coming back again soon!"
"3.0","The setting is nice, and the food is fresh.  As much as I would like to give this place more stars, I haven't been impressed by the taste of the food (it's on the bland side) or the serving sizes (sometimes I leave thinking I could have had two portions)."
"5.0","Pleasantly surprised by the quality of food at Thai Gourmet! The pumpkin curry was absolutely amazing, which it quickly became my all-time favorite Thai curry so far. I haven't yet tried a curry quite this yummy. It was such a delicious combination of savory and sweet, but it was also very comforting and perfect for the cold winter day that I stopped in. As other reviewers have mentioned, the spice level at Thai Gourmet might be slightly higher than other Thai restaurants in town. I ordered a 4 spice level and it was quite spicy, yet it was still manageable for me. If you're not big on spice, I recommend ordering a level down from your usual. I'm really looking forward to trying other dishes here. Not only was my food delicious, but the prices were very reasonable. Definitely will be back! Hopefully my schedule will permit me to visit again sooner rather than later!"
"5.0","Perfection.  I wish I'd have found this place on the first day. I had the Arepa Bolleno (the shredded beef, black beans, plantains and white cheese) and it was like heaven. I added the cilantro sauce and spicy avocado sauce, which really wasn't spicy-it just had a very mild bite.I also had the ground beef empanada. It was good, but I like a bit more flavor and bite with mine. I would say that it's a good choice for picky kid eaters. I wish I'd have had more time to try more of the Aprepas but alas, I must leave on a jet plane. Very friendly people, affordable, and simple, good food. You won't be disappointed."
"5.0","I said months ago that the food was too salty, but I tried it again and it was really nicely balanced this time around. I enjoyed it! Updated from 3 to 5 stars."
"5.0","A beautiful out door bar. You can see a lot of buildings from here.The roof is open in the summer. They have tvs and a bar and bar food.This is on the 3rd floor of Sienna Mercato."
"5.0","Everything was perfect. Coffee and food were amazing. Atmosphere was relaxed and felt like home. Server was friendly and helpful.Would highly recommend!"
"5.0","Went here for restaurant week, ordered the tenderloin and my wife had the filet. Both dishes were incredible. Our waiter was very helpful and helped us choose the best option for food and drinksThe regular menu looked amazing but expensive. Would def come back on a special date night"
"5.0","Four of us ate there today, the food was great, love the decor in the back, the owner came talked to us, very friendly young man, he found out we were from out of town, suggested the other good restaurant to eat, events to go to, we were very impressed how warm and heartfelt."
"4.0","Best place to eat in the Rivers. Great food and service for a reasonable price. We ate at every Restruant there. This one is defiantly the best. Friendly atmosphere. They are very accommodating."
"5.0","Small but tasty place for breakfast.  Plan for a wait but service is good and fast.   Also, cash only!  'The morning after' is a good choice which is a sample of all breakfast foods."
"1.0","Didn't make my Lo mein spicy like I requested and didn't give us any silverware. We're in a hotel and we don't have silverware here...you practically gave us inedible food. The review is too short to be a full post so I am still typing to make it more visible so that everyone can see this!"
"5.0","We planned to go to another very popular breakfast spot and there was quite a wait so we choose Raymonds as a 2nd choice. Got right in, and their breakfast was AWESOME! Service was great. All the food is cooked by Raymond-homemade sauces, breads, local meats. Can't say enough. We will be back! Do not discount it for lesser reviews than some other places on Yelp. It will not disappoint!"
"5.0","Please do not eat here because it took me three nights to finally get a table! First off, you can make a meal on the delicious bread basket assortment. Get the slightly larger one. The butters are lightly flavored. The charcuterie boards are out-of-this-world amazing. The pizza - hope you're sitting down- will have NO pepperoni! That is for amateurs. The toppings are things like bacon, arugula, & chicken sausage!Waitstaff was very attentive and pleasant. Again, please don't go here, I love it more!"
"4.0","We visited with a group of 8 for a celebratory dinner. It was restaurant week and we all ended up getting the deal. I had the crab chowder, Oscar filet and cheesecake. Everything was fantastic! I highly recommend the crab chowder, it was the best I have ever tried. Overall fun atmosphere, great staff and excellent food!"
"1.0","There is an out of his mind, hateful, prejudiced middle-eastern guy that works there that actually called 911 on me & 2 African American guys in line behind me 4 absolutely no reason. I had asked politely 2 speak 2 the manager because was really being harassed by drunk guy in there & he screamed at me, then went off on the guys in line behind me. We at no time raised our voices, were rude back, were totally sober, polite, well dressed. I did tell the guys behind me he's just a jerk because they were stunned at how they were screamed at, young guys who happened 2 walk in while he was being rude 2 me, then he threatened 2 call 911 on us , I said why, because you're prejudiced, so he CALLED THE POLICE, screaming at me I HAVE YOUR FACE. We left. Beyond ridiculous. I believe in being honest about my actions, swear 2 God this is what happened. So an urge 4 pizza might land u in jail if u go here, not worth it, was really disturbing. What kind of place tolerates this kind of behavior from employees? At 1 point the cook walked up hearing the dude's yelling, but saw dude was just losing his mind & walked away. So I guess the middle-eastern guy was in charge. happened on a fri around 12 am."
"5.0","We came here aftr 2 long days travel from Niagara Falls nd Pittsburgh temple. Ambience is gud, service pretty fast, buzzing tables, attentive staff (amitoj). 10$ for buffet with fair number of items Absolutely satisfied!! I suggest this place if u want a decent satisfactory buffet"
"3.0","Saturday night. Table for 2. We walked in a little before 8 PM and saw only 4 tables seated (2 of which were larger parties). Despite that, the noise level was insane. I had to shout at my friend and the waiter had to crouch down to hear me. The decor looks like they tried so hard to be cool but it just looks like everything else out there. Or worse - something staged at Target. Our waiter was awkward in his interactions and came off a little unsure. As someone in the service industry, you should know what an Arnold Palmer is. I ordered the Bloomfield and my friend ordered the Fox Chapel (both medium well). It took close to 40 minutes to get our burgers. His fries looked like they were sitting out for a few days and so did my mac n cheese, but to our surprise, both were tasty. Still, you eat with your eyes, ya know? The thing that got me was the fact that they tout F2T, but they drown these burgers in toppings. I couldn't taste the meat at all through the sauteed greens and my friend's burger had so much goat cheese that the meat took a backseat to that flavor. I understand wanting to dress up a burger, but shouldn't farm to table meat be the one stealing the show?"
"3.0","Super small taco joint in Southside with $3 tacos and limited bar seating. I got the carnitas taco and pollo taco, both on a corn tortilla. Decent place for a quick and filling lunch, so I might come back to try some of the other tacos on their menu."
"5.0","Seems like this place always has a new excellent beer on tap as well as a new menu option available. If you can't decide on food the pierogi is very good and you won't go wrong with any of the sandwiches."
"5.0","Great service! small buffet 2-3 chicken choices rice and 3-4 side options but all very tasty best mint chutney I've ever had!"
"5.0","Such a great find for authentic Japanese. The sushi was very yummy and it reminded me of japan. My fianc√© is Japanese and we go to japan every summer so it was nice enjoying the Japanese flavors once more. The building seems a little old - it would be nice if they updated it a bit."
"5.0","First time visitor. Very cool decor in the place, high ceilings and lots of seating as well as a big bar to sit at. Great server that we had , he took our orders quickly and with a great attitude. He definitely made the meal better. 2 If is had build your own burgers and they were super tasty. Nice size and cooked perfectly . The rosemary fries were very tasty as well as the Mac and cheese which was super yummy and cheesy. One of us had the impossible burger which is vegan and I truly could not taste any difference than the full fat beef burger we were eating. I was blown away at how great hat burger tasted. Excellent draft list and cocktail list. Only weird thing was they only had soda in single cans , maybe the other sodas were free refills but a Diet Coke was in a can. I will be back to this place without hesitation . Check it out you will dig it."
"5.0","Tasty and very customizable you can substitute just about anything. They use a lot of farmer's cheese which is a nice change and a pretty good addition. My fave is the chicken taco w shredded cheese. The nachos are a good choice if you like big dishes for cheap. It's a huge dish for like $5.99 or something. They also have Mexican juice."
"2.0","Going downhill quickly,  everything was unavailable that I tried to order.  And no more sugar-free pie"
"4.0","I liked to hide here between classes @ Pitt.PROS:Free WiFi;Great food;Great pastries;nice staff;cleanCONS:  CRAZY busy between 11:30 and 1pm (lunch rush is nuts here!)Parking  (either street on Forbes or surrounding or the Sennott Square garage underneath the building, but the garage is busy after 9:30am)As for the 'takes reservations' question, they have a room that you can rent out for meetings and anything--but that's the only reservations they take.Phone/Fax Order are a 'can do' here."
"2.0","So disappointed in our meal. Not sure if they have new chef or cooking staff, but every part of our meal was bad. Shrimp Cocktail - shrimp totally over cooked & hard. Shaved Brussel Sprouts salad - chewy. Filet Mignon (medium cook)- burnt on the outside. Scallops - Porcini rub recommended, but it was so salty. Scallops were sandy too.For $200+ -totally dissatisfied. Will not be returning."
"4.0","We can to get a quick bite, prior to a show. For a Friday night, and all of the events going on this particular evening, i was anticipating a wait and a big crowd. It was busy, but not to walk packed. We were sat immediately. The service was quick and the server was friendly and attentive. The food came out timely and was good. The restaurant has two floors. A bar and dining room on each. It's kid friendly and clean for a bar. In my opinion, more so than their Mt Washington location.We look forward to returning."
"3.0","I was not too impressed with Gennaro's. I had a slice of the regular cheese. The crust was a thinner, NY style in consistency and texture, yet did not have the crispness necessary to make the crust good. The cheese was decent and the sauce was a little on the sweet side. It was not a bad slice of pizza, just not very good. I wish I would have known to get the deep dish. It looks really good."
"4.0","Great cuban sandwich on a pretzel bun.. amazing!!!!I love this restaurant!  Its conveniently located in the Casino and I often place takeout orders.The bar staff is courteous and so on the ball.  I can place a takeout order - and play some penny slots and in 10 minutes time my food is ready.  I have never had to wait long for food.  I have had the steak hoagie, and the chicken Caesar salad and they too are amazing and fresh.  Wheelhouse is a little bit more pricy than a restaurant chain perhaps but I think its worth it. My fellow yelpers.. I totally recommend."
"1.0","We have been this this place twice. Once last yr and then again 8/3/19. Last yr. We came to Pittsburg for a baseball game and we put our name  and phone # in to be seated. She told us 15 mins. We waited over an hr. Because they forgot us. The waiter ended up being great and the food was as well but being forgotten and she did tell us she forgot. So fast forward 1 yr. We come again for a baseball game and this time bring our son. We did get right in, the lady says our server will be right over to wash down our table. So we waited and waited. A guy comes over and and takes our drink order. 1 of us ordered soda 1 ordered water and 1 ordered a beer. Guy comes out with 2 drinks and says beer will be right out. 1/2 hr later the beer comes out. Mind you it wasnt busy and to boot he wasnt our server. I was just about to walk out when the beer arrived. The waitress took our order which this poor new girl got thrown our table bc the other waitress left early. It left us with no waitress. So this poor nee waitress came and took our order. Over a half hr to get our food. So food comes my husband and sons food was warming. Mine was fricken cold. I truly mean cold. I was fuming because of all the time we sat and wasted. The suoervisor/cook/ waittess( way to much for 1 person) came to talk to us. She ended up taking care of our whole bill. I normally do post reviews however the supervisor told me to. Can you believe that. She said that if I were to call the mgrs would just give me the run around.  Want to mention that as we were sitting there there was a very rowdy and horrible and I mean horrible value group behind us. No one bothered to say anything to that group. So here I am. I will never go back. 2 times to shitty experiences. Jerome Bettis shoukd be more aware of this because his business will sink."
"4.0","After driving for 7 hours from Chicago my friend Alison and I had to pick up my bud Natalia where she was working. Once I called her to say we were close she said she had to finish up something, so we parked across from this place and waited...and waited...and waited. Okay, maybe the wait wasn't that long, but the delicious smells from Chinatown Inn wafted into Alison's car and we decided we should just go there. And go there we did! Instantly I felt comfortable because this place reminded me of the Chinese places in strip malls in Northern Virginia. There were fish in a big tank, cozy booths, and rather dim lighting. They had a lot of regulars there the Friday night we went. Most people were talking to the waiters like old friends. Our waiter was young and adorable and looked like an anime character with his spiky hair. He showed us how to fold the paper bags into the triangle point. We were FASCINATED! I wish I could remember his name to give him proper props. I ate a spicy chicken dish that opened up my sinuses. I split a plain lo mein with Natalia because were just in the mood. Everything was hot and fresh. Lovely!To note: if you happen to be an older gentleman who is bald and owns a beige sports coat, this is where your meetings are held! There were three booths in a row with one of these gentlemen sitting with his back to me. I felt like I was looking at an Escher painting!"

"3.0","Bettis' name is definitely carrying this restaurant. We came in for drinks & appetizers. The drinks took forever and the appetizers were just okay. The mini pierogies came out like warm and the tater tot nachos were just a pile of mush. Cocktails were average, nothing special. People will still continue fo flock here because of the name but food and drinks are nothing to write home about."
"4.0","First, I hadn't realize Cafe Raymond had moved a few blocks. That through me for a loop! Anyway, I had been to the old location no less than 100x for lunch over the years - would recommend lox salad and any soup. But this review is for their brunch, which I hadn't realize Cafe Raymond had. A quick search on Yelp for breakfast places and I just had to go. I met a friend here and she was a few minutes ahead of me. She was able to grab a table and hot tea, no issues. Once I arrived, we placed our order at the counter then reclaimed our table. We were there a few minutes after 10am on a Sunday, which was perfect timing. As we sat waiting for our food, a huge line formed. It seems like people eat and leave pretty quickly though, so I can't imagine waiting for a table would take long. The ordering process is streamlined and they use a number system to locate you when your food is ready. We both ended up ordering the same thing, which was surprising with so many good choices on the menu -- sausage, egg and cheese croissant. I was pleasantly surprised when it showed up with a side of potatoes. For ~$9, you can't beat it. The croissant was comprised of fluffy goodness and the egg arrived piping hot. There's a self-serve water station, which I always appreciate.All of the staff I encountered were pleasant and it was a very successful start to my Sunday. Thanks, Cafe Raymond!"
"3.0","Generous portions and very inexpensive prices.  A somewhat confusing array of Middle Eastern and Indian foods, but all very tasty.  The market has some unusual items that you can't find anywhere else."
"4.0","Delicious tacos! Try to ask them what is freshest and/or best that day as they come up with a special taco most days. They're super kind even when they are packed with customers."
"4.0","Spot on suggestions from the cook when we first arrived! We enjoyed the New Yorker and the Franco...with a side of well seasoned Cajun fries. We'll definitely be back!"
"4.0","This restaurant would make an amazing spot for lunch.Generally, the food here is very tasty. Seafood is fresh and everything is well seasoned. I tried their lobster bisque fries and it was delicious. Big, plump lobster pieces and gravy on top of fries make this dish a great choice for appetizerI had the salmon and tuna lunch meal. Both of the fishes are very fresh and cooked to the right rareness. They are tender and melt in your mouth. I recommend ordering the fish with sweet soy seasoning. This sauce complement the fish very well. The portion is also big so the dishes will definitely fill you up. For beverages, their selection is pretty standard and typical. A bit of everything for everyone. They do have some local draft beer but unfortunately, i couldn't try it because some options were run out. Service is a little bit slow but the staffs are friendly and they do try their best to serve you."
"4.0","I live 45 minutes outside of the city and the drive is always worth the grub! Because Pamela's is so delicious, there is usually a wait on the weekends but the line moves fast. THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH! The Walnut Street location has a PNC Bank a few doors down. Enjoy those hotcakes!"
"5.0","O.M.G. I currently live in Cleveland and I have my favorite breakfast/brunch go to place here (called Coventry Inn). But after going to Pamela's, now I'm depressed that Cleveland doesn't have a brunch place as good as Pamela's! I am craving this spot!Pamela's is your usual diner spot... place looks a bit homey, a bit dirty, and a bit...local. But that's when you know it's good right? It's got some real homemade cooking into it. If you don't want to listen to my suggestions on what to order, just (i beg you) make sure you order the CORN BEEF HASH. Here's my reviews below now:Corn Beef Hash (5+): I don't know what they add in there, but that sh*t is delicious and addictive. I took one bite, and it was like my palette was ready for 5 more bowls of it. The corned beef in the hash is so good. They season the corned beef so well that it gives the whole dish this heavenly taste.Chocolate Chip Banana Hotcakes (5): I think Pamela's called crepes hotcakes. This was just chocolate chip banana crepes. So naturally, it was delicious. The hotcakes was made really well, a bit crispy on the ends. and the melting chocolate with banana was just yummmmmmy.Go to Pittsburgh, and you better stop at Pamela's. There might be a wait, but trust me, it's worth it. And it's cheap!"
"5.0","Every meal we've had at Sausalido has been fantastic, so much so that we decided to rent out the downstairs and have our wedding reception there.  Our guests raved about the food and the service. The bean dip, smoked gouda, vegetable risotto and arancini were my favorites, but everything was outstanding for everyone, including vegetarians and gluten-free guests. The risotto was the best I've ever had, hands down. The staff couldn't have been nicer, especially Jules, who treated us like family. From our first contact with the restaurant, Erika (the event coordinator) was fantastic to work with: responsive and very flexible. The response to everything we wanted to order or do was 'Yes'. In addition to offering superb food, Sausalido does everything possible to make sure that you have a great experience, and does so with very reasonable prices (also, BYOB is a huge plus!!). This place is an absolute must!"
"5.0","My husband and I last minute decided to come here with our two small boys while in Pittsburgh on a trip. It was seriously one of the best places we ate at while here. It doesn't look like much from the outside until you walk in. Super cute and somewhat eclectic. We were quickly sat and our server was AWESOME! Best service I've had in awhile. She was very friendly and sat down to talk to our oldest. We exchanged stories throughout the evening about our kids. She made sure the kids were always taken care, which is HUGE in my book. I got a sangria and it was delicious! They have a good variety for drinks. We ordered edamame and sushi for apps. It was good! Our dinners... EXCELLENT!!! I highly suggest this place. If I come back to Pittsburgh this is a must!"
"5.0","This is probably my favorite restaurant in PGH. Great ambiance. And you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I love the takoyaki and the spicy tuna onigiri, and the presentation of the food is just as good. The cocktail menu is great, too. I highly recommend!"
"4.0","I dropped in on a Thursday night, and place is as always very popular and packed! Regardless, we were able to find seating because of the quick turn around of people finishing their meals.I ordered fries and chicken and waffles - I was super impressed with the chicken waffles. The waffles were absolutely delicious: a blend of savory sweet. The honey butter definitely shines, but I think the best part was the bits of salt crystals within the waffles that provided texture and worked very well with the chicken (which was mild flavored and much more flavorful than 'southern').The fries, although I liked them, tasted very healthy and very underseasoned (and unevenly distributed), which is disappointing because the fries with seasoning tasted pretty good!Overall chicken and waffles were a hit and will be one of my go-to orders when I return."
"3.0","Granted, when I went with a friend, it had recently opened. Tried two of the brews/ nothing standout and the food was typical bar fare..nothing that would make me want to return."
"4.0","As many of my reviews have stated in the past, you get points with me right of the bat if I can easily make a reservation online or with an app. Burgh'ers checked that box. It was freezing on the night we headed to the Lawrenceville location...and when we arrived we were hoping for a warm welcome, but the restaurant itself was so cold I kept my jacket on the whole time. Not so great.We got the pierogi appetizer, which was pretty good - you only get 4 pierogis for $10...which is pretty lame.I got the Polish Hill burger. I ordered it medium well and it definitely came out medium, but I'm not that picky and the burger was good. My husband got the make your own burger and was happy with his choice. The fries were good too.  Overall, the food was good - nothing spectacular. Four stars because it wasn't cooked to order and the price point is steep for what you get (and the chilly atmosphere), but worth a try for the fun menu options."
"5.0","I don't eat meat and they have the best veggie burgers in Pittsburgh. Their veggie burgers don't taste like cardboard. Everything has so much flavor!!!! I love this place!!!!"
"5.0","food was amazing, loved the vibe and the decorations. staff was very friendly and attentive and large dinner portions. will definitely come back!"
"5.0","Hands down, best tacos in town. Fun establishment too. Not fancy, not trying to outdo itself. Just good, quick reasonably priced, delicious tacos. With corn tortillas!"
"1.0","The food wasn't bad. The trash cans were over flowing. Trash was everywhere. And my chicken Alfredo tortellini didn't even have chicken in it."
"3.0","Similar place to raisin canes/slim chickens but of Lower quality, more along the line of Zaxby's just with spice. That being said the venue is cool and having a beer watching the game upstairs would be a fun time. Staff is chill. Rather go to bird on the run or even chic fil a to get fried chicken though."
"5.0","Food and service were great!  We came here for dinner for the first time a few weeks ago.  It's inside the station square building, across from Buckheads. We loved all of the food we ordered and wished we can make them at home.  We tried the kushi katsu, dynamite roll (spicy scallops) definitely spicy but love it, sashimi platter seems like a small portion for two but still worth it if you like sashimi bc of variety and taste.  The sashimi is fresh and definitely the best I've tasted in awhile.  My hubby was still hungry after these, so we ordered the beef maki and curry calamari. The calamari was huge and we liked that the breading was soft but not soggy. It's hard to explain the texture. All sauces were on point as well.  My mouth is watering just thinking about the food.I also tried the fujiyama cocktail which is vodka, pina colada and banana.  The glass was small, so I probably could've had 2 or 3 since it tasted good. Haha.  The price wasn't as bad as other sushi/japanese places.Server was friendly, prompt and attentive. She even offered to validate our parking, which took $2 off.  We didn't know they validated.  I liked the ambience/decor.  I think they're going for an old school authentic japanese look.  My hubby said it was plain for his taste.  Overall, I recommend this place!"
"5.0","Really tasty tacos at a reasonable price ($3/taco) They aren't trying to be the ultra gourmet tacos like at smoke, but this place is much more like a proper taco shop you'd find in Texas and California. The Vegan Tacos can be made vegetarian with added cheese and the loaded nachos were delicious. Lots of hot sauce options at there counter make for a satisfying experience."
"4.0","The Capital Grill, Washington DC.I have been waiting almost two weeks to write a review in regards to my experience in this restaurant. I made a reservation online because it is a busy place to dine in.I thought that arriving on time was going to be at issue because I decided to go 5 days prior to the inauguration. But no, I arrived on time and was directed to a not-so-loud room as requested in my reservation.Service can be described in one word: impecable.Food: I would like to find a place which main entrees would not be beef. But, this is US and the most fanciful traditional American cuisine dish is a steak. I should not complaint because my meal was exquisite. Perfect term, moist but broiled, medium rare, pleasant cut.The salad is one of the best salads I have every eaten. It reminded me the one I ate with Janica while being in NY my last trip.My mother in law ordered the fish. The buttery cream that accompanies the fish had a soft flavor, rich and tasty.The spinach had a combination of flavors that had a not so good acceptance by my palate.The creme br√ªl√©e was, OMG!, a difficult choice to make but a satisfactory one."
"1.0","Inconsistent. Ruins the experience. Some days it's sugary dessert n some days hot enough to kill"
"2.0","Sandwich was disappointing.  Corned beef tasted like generic deli sliced meat.  It wasn't even as good as Boars Head corned beef.  You would be better off cooking your own corned beef to make a sandwich, it was messy and lacking great flavor.  I would not go back."
"5.0","We live in the Strip District and Salem's is one of our regular stops.  This is as good as Mediterranean/Indian food gets!  Let's cut the intro and get right into the good stuff:Pros:The food, the food, the food!Seating area is ample if you'd prefer to dine inTake out is always packed well and convenientInterior is cleanThey have their own parking lot (In the Strip, it's a huge plus!)Dear God the desserts!Staff is friendly and helpfulPrices can not be beatThe value for the price is terrific, lots of foodDid I mention the food??  It's delicious!Cons:Not a one! This place rocks!In summary, if you've missed out on this little gem at the end of the Strip District, you must visit!  Seriously, go now!"
"1.0","Eat 'n Park is passable for certain things. The hamburgers are satisfactory and although the salad bar will never be compared to the extraordinary Souplantation/ Sweet Tomatoes, it is not bad.  My wife and I were desperate for food after a late Pittsburgh Pirates game, which left us few choices, and we made the mistake of coming here and ordering the $9.99 Midnight buffet, which was lousy.  The eggs, fried potatoes, hash browns, onions, and mushrooms drowning in liquid, were tasteless.  Pancakes that are stuck to the container in which they are placed are not likely to please and the soggy waffle my wife had was not enjoyable either. If I had been told that the corned beef hash was canned dog food or that it was made with Spam, it would have been believable as there was no hint of beef as it is known to most people. The quality of the food at Golden Corral is spectacular in comparison to Eat 'n Park and the value is infinitely better, $8.99 for a breakfast buffet that includes an extensive salad selection and so much more well-prepared, well-seasoned, tasty items. Breakfast foods are now served there throughout lunch and dinner.  I do not plan to order the Eat 'n Park Midnight Buffet or the breakfast buffet ever again.  If I do, I will deserve my fate.  I continue to have difficulty understanding why Eat 'n Park is such a spectacular success, particularly given that at its other divisions, including Six Penn Kitchen, it has demonstrated that it knows how to prepare appealing cuisine. I would have been much better off at Primanti Brothers, where one can secure a late night feast: half pound cheeseburger with all the trimmings and which includes enough of the area's best french fries for an army, for a mere $8.19.  This Eat 'n Park location has been nicely remodeled.  It is now more spacious, attractive, and comfortable.  There is not much more  that can be said for it than that."
"5.0","Everything about this place rocks! Excellent food and good service. Definitely get the pancakes."
"5.0","I love this place! Always good service. Always good food. Always good drinks and beer selection. They never disappoint. I also love that they have games available and no TVs. Kinda forces interaction with whom you are with. Much needed!"
"5.0","Very nice atmosphere and amazing customer service food was great. Samantha was our server she was the best with so much knowledge about each entree and selection of beers. Even the hostess was so nice accommodating our last minute request to hold a birthday cake while we ate so we could surprise our daughter :)We will be back for sure !"
"5.0","The Summit is a fantastic bar and now restaurant. It's small, and the selection is somewhat limited, but it certainly has all the right stuff.  The atmosphere is fantastic. Everything from the music to the lighting is exactly what you would want from a neighborhood high class joint. The drinks are better than ever. Since opening in 2013 they've made improvements to their classics and added seasonal drinks that are great. Their beer selection has improved as well."
"4.0","Let me first say I will try this place again because they have pride in what they create.  They are culinary artist, not cooks and it shows in the menu.  I will always give a place a second and third try if the passion shows and here it does.  Unfortunately, my meal was not as outstanding as I hoped, but still better than most.The chicken noodle soup was average, but in Pittsburgh we are spoiled (and I hate to admit it) with Eat n Park's chicken noodle.My chicken wrap cam with lettuce, lime aoli, bacon, and bbq sauce.  It was good, but the BBQ sauce either didn't fit with the rest or was missing that spicy tang I like in BBQ sauces.Thought the prices were slighly high for what you got."
"2.0","Wise Guys is your typical off beat pizza shop. There are no frills, there are no items I would particularly recommend. However, if you'd like cheap pizza and the typical sides that come along with that then this is your spot. No room to sit and eat so pick it up and get out of there. I am not saying it's bad by any means, it just isn't anything special."
"5.0","Chill place to watch a game. Stuffed dates were awesome and the Turkey sandwich and friend chicken sandwich were on point. Very cool to find somewhere in Pittsburgh with bomb food where you can relax and watch a game. Wish I could eat here every day. Can't wait to come back!"
"5.0","I used these guys for box lunches for a meeting with a VIP customer. Service was very personal and top notch. The owner delivered the lunch himself and right on time - even though I was a little vague on the exact address. The people raved about the taste, quality, quantity and variety. Craftwork has a new customer for life. Highly recommend them!"
"5.0","Delicious lunch! I had the polvo guisado and was so happy I did. Quaint, quiet and quick! Felt the service was great and attentive. I'd recommend to anyone to try if you enjoy Portuguese or just in an adventurous mood!"
"5.0","Last night I planned on getting home from work, working out, eating a healthy dinner and going grocery shopping.  Instead I laid in bed until Pens traffic died down and dragged my roomie out to SouthSide with me to finally try some tacos from this place. And then we got ice cream. And I have no regrets.This place is so small you almost miss it, but it is located exactly to the right of Twelve on Carson and is adorable when you get inside.  It's narrow with about 8? barstools lining the counter and maybe two other hightops against the window.  It's decorated in sugar skulls and cool, bright colors and I didn't even mind waiting for my tacos because I was taking in all the d√©cor!It was Taco Tuesday, but there weren't too many other people in there, probably because it was the first really cool day of the season (plus the Pens game!).  Even Tia, the bartender at Twelve who also works behind the counter at Doce was very surprised at how dead it was.  Service was quick.  I got one chicken and one carnitas taco and my roomie got a chicken (minus avocado) and Americano.  We inhaled them and they were excellent.  We ended up ordering one more each.  Our bellies were stuffed full and we paid (a whopping 11 dollars each for 3 filling tacos and a bottle of water) and were on our way!I agree with other reviewers when they say that these tacos are better than Las Palmas.  Doce's ingredients are carefully and perfectly executed and my tacos weren't falling apart in my hand like they ALWAYS do everywhere else in Pittsburgh.  They were so full of flavor and everything worked together so nicely.  I always find myself having to add hot sauce or more salsa or salt and pepper, but here - what they served was spot on.  I really liked this place and I think they are doing an amazing job.  I didn't mind the small menu at all and thought it was a nice thing to have a special of the day where you could get something different.  It would be nice to add a fish taco at some point to the regular menu though :) Thanks Doce..Cant wait to come back!"
"5.0","This is my second 5 star in a row...and I don't give many.  My restaurant selections must getting better with age much like the 28 day dry aged steaks we had here last night!   I had the porterhouse and my wife the New York strip, both 28 day dry aged.  Without a doubt it was the best steak I have ever eaten.  Even better than the 40 day dry aged Himalayan sea salt ribeye steak I had at David Burke's in chitown.  No comparison really.   We had the calamari and roasted pepper appetizer and enjoyed it...could hardly eat it all.  Enjoyed our meal by splitting a yummy spinach salad topped with hot bacon dressing.  What a good night and good meal.  We were surprised with a 'first timer' free dessert.  It was a two sided plate with a chocolate fudge-like delight on one side and a wonderful cheesecake fusion on the other...it was so good we even ate the 'words off the plate'...have to be there know this. Heart of the city which is nice and a wonderful decor and atmosphere.  Comp valet parking makes parking in the city a breeze!  Don't forget this place when you crave good food and especially steak!  They made our 20th anniversary dinner a wonderful night."
"5.0","This was an impromptu family stop on our way to the Pittsburgh Penguins home opener.  Fast and friendly service followed by a street taco made with fresh ingredients and a lot of love.  We had the Carnitas, Pollo, Americano and Carne Molida.  Each taco was presented beautifully and you could taste each ingredient with each bite.  If you are driving through the Southside, please make it a point to stop for a fresh street taco."
"5.0","Fast service, good value. Lamb vindaloo was flavorful  and the chicken Tikka was very good too. To end our meal we had rice pudding which was very enjoyable.They had a Groupon and they do a 10% off discount for UPMC employees. Will be visiting again!"
"5.0","Went here last night during an overnight stay in Pittsburgh. Sampled several of their very varied cocktails and appetizers which were very good. The staff and customers at the bar were very friendly. When we went to pay a local customer whom we were chatting to had paid for our first round, now that is true Pittsburgh hospitality, left us with a very good first impression."
"1.0","The food is decent.... Some would say some of the best inthe city, cool.  The place can get busy and its not overly clear if you should sit and hope to order or stand at the far end to order and then sit (if available).My concern is with the sanitary practices at the establishment. Today, my second visit, the lady with the 3/4 tattoo sleeve that was working/taking orders dropped the top of the squeeze bottle for the sour cream/sauce in the trash as she was switching bottles and just picked it out and put it right back on top of the squeeze bottle. Said sour cream/sauce bottle was then used to dress every order there after.  Foul. There is a 3 bowl sink right to her left not sure why it wasnt washed and sanitized then put back on the bottle. Another customer noticed as well and clearly was grossed out as she mentioned it to her friend. The same lady also removes customers trash from the bar, which is great, but she also was putting tortillas on the grill with no gloves, and munching on chips.  However, the guy that was working the food station seemed to have all his safe serve requirments together.On a side note, they also never informed customers that they were out of avocado for the pollo tacos and when multiple customers asked they just said 'we are out'.  Shouldnt you let the customer know ahead of time?I was impressed that they compe'ed the food of a police officer that came in for lunch.So all in all  sanitation and customer service could be better.  If you are ok with those two being out of whack of sorts the food is decent."
"5.0","The best pizza at the University of Pittsburgh. Cheap pies that are phenomenal in taste. Well worth the parking hassle to get this pizza. I've never had a bad pizza here!!"
"5.0","This review is for the banquet facility. My family had a special event in their party room this past weekend. The point man a the restaurant was Jim and he could not have been nicer or professional. He told us he wouldn't be there the day of the event but he made sure another employee, Dave, knew of our special needs. The event went off smoothly and we could not have been happier with the food, service and price. A great restaurant  to stage an event"
"4.0","SETTINGExtremely spacious with an earthy feel. Wooden floors, wooden chairs and tables. Mostly small tables for two. There is a couch/coffee table in front of a fireplace and larger table in the back. Free wifi. This review is mostly for Arnold's atmosphere, since I was here to do some work. This place just opened, so it was not crowded at all. A great thing for me, but I'm sure they will get busier one word gets out. Shhh! I almost had the whole place to myself! For now, the non-busy and spacious feel of Arnold's Tea is what makes this establishment special. That and the soft smooth jazz (I love me some sultry sax and laidback jams) playing in the background. Exactly what I needed.DRINKSI had the 'Arnold on the green' which was green tea and lemonade. I liked how light and refreshing it was. Not too sweet and exactly how I imagined it would taste like. They also have a selection of sandwiches and pastries. On the back wall is a shelf of jars with tea leaves where you could buy tea leaves that ranged from your typical ones to the more exotic.IMPRESSIONSI would come back to study and do work here. Again, the big open space and jazz music sealed the deal for me. You would never see me studying at Starbucks, Crazy Mocha, or the other chains because they are the complete opposite--crowded and noisy. Instead of sophisticated jazz, I hear unsophisticated gossip and obnoxious laughter. On repeat. Worst playlist ever. Arnold's is the antithesis, and a small business. I respect that. Despite my desire to keep this place hush hush, so I can have this place to myself again, I encourage you to check it out if you need a place to lounge and get some work done."
"3.0","Why can't I give half stars? I'd probably give them a 3 1/2.The chicken 65 was pretty darn good. I like their gobi manchurian as well. Dosa nights are pretty great (buy 1 get one half off). I wasn't a huge fan of the lamb vindaloo.Portions are decently sized. Entrees are a bit expensive but hey the old converted house vibe is nice. They could benefit from a TV playing some bollywood songs. Maybe I'm just too used to seeing those at Indian restaurants."
"4.0","Great food and great service!The Maffalda Alexander is FANTASTIC, I've ordered there many times for dinner for the family, and the family style servings are gret for gatherings and meetings.They also have a GREAT salad with candied walnuts and dried cranberries that is to die for!Definitely a must have when ordering there!"
"4.0","This is review is based off their old location. My wife and I were trying to meet up with some friends at Pamela's for brunch on a Sunday. The wait time was too long, so we got on Yelp to see what was near by. We choose Cafe Raymond. This was a great place to get brunch. Very cute place with a nice theme. I ordered the Ciabatta & Lox - NY acme salmon, cream cheese, capers, red onion, cucumber, tomato. It was a really good sandwich. Plenty of salmon to accompany the rest of the meal. It also came with a side of breakfast potatoes. I was not expecting much from these but they were great. They were not mushy, which was what i expected. Overall a great find if you are in the Strip District."
"4.0","Really like it, not sure that I loved it.  Pizza was good, staff was friendly and soda was cold."
"4.0","To start, the food here is five stars. Period. We tried the beef tenderloin, chicken skins, and pork belly from the robotayaki menu and all were delicious. The pork belly literally melted in our mouths. We followed with the tuna, eel, and scallop nigiri. All were absolutely delicious but, as others have mentioned, a bit overpriced for the amount of food (2 pieces instead of 1 would suffice). We moved on to the pork ramen and the miso ramen, both of which were wonderful but the miso ramen is out of this world good. I would have devoured a second bowl. The crispy chili is the key. Fried ice cream dessert was nice as well. Cocktails were nothing special but good (the 33oz Asahi paired better with the meal in my opinion). I knocked off a star for service. A less-than-pleasant hostess informed me upon arrival that our 8:30 reservation wasn't ready yet (it was 8:30 on the dot) and to grab a drink. No big deal. However, we waited nearly 20 minutes for both the table and two drinks to be maid. Before we could even settle the bar tab, we were being whisked to our table late. Our server, who ended up being great, took nearly 20 minutes to bring water and to even ask if we were ready to order. The service may not have annoyed some, but it was a weird way to start what was an otherwise outstanding experience."
"5.0","I'm so happy my friend invited me to this special place. The food is delicious, fresh and beautiful. Love the atmosphere and open kitchen."
"5.0","Love it here. Feel so lucky this place is so close to our house in Mt Wash. Very different than anywhere else on Shiloh street or elsewhere on the mount. Always a great atmosphere here. Totally chill. Awesome cocktails. Great beer choices. Very underrated food. Always interesting choices. Always fresh and delicious. Currently decorated for Christmas and it's amazing."
"5.0","This might not be for everyone, but this is everything to me. Salem's makes _great_ halal food. Chicken tandoori, chicken curry, and lamb curry dinners are some of my favorites. My friend and I make it a point to go here at least once a week! The food is great and cheap, too!The service is great, the men working always greet me as 'brother,' which you don't hear anywhere else. This location in the strip is much bigger and cleaner than the one in Oakland, if you like middle eastern food or just want to try it out, you should definitely check out Salem's!"
"4.0","Got a pepperoni pizza and a dozen wings with the dry rub and both were excellent. Didn't have high hopes when I walked but everything was great and well priced. The place was good for what it was. Will go back again next time I'm in Pittsburgh."
"5.0","This is my second update to my original review. It appears they have taken constructive criticism to heart. I've been back to the location three or four times since my last update. All I can say is that the quality has continually improved. The french fries are even better than ever, a little less sweet and lighter on the seasoning so that the balance is better. The chicken remains excellent in its cooking. Where they have improved the most is their seasoning mixtures and technique. It looks like they Found the right mixture of dry and oil and seasoning. I have been able to get the plane, mild, and moderate mixes and enjoy them all, I think because the salt levels have come down so much and you can enjoy the overall experience better. I'm very happy to report all this, so I would encourage anyone that had some early misadventures here regarding the salt or seasonings to try it again.  They have really stepped up their game."
"5.0","This place is my cheers! I am here daily for lunch and do happy hours sometimes. The staff is awesome, the food is reasonably priced, especially from 11 to 2 when they have their lunch specials, and it's tasty. I really like their steak wrap as well as their pizza. Service is always quick!"
"2.0","The pizza was decent but the appetizers and service left a lot to be desired. The server's attitude bordered on downright rude.Next time I'll skip the trip and get delivery! Better yet, try out a different local pizza place."
"4.0","What I like: the food is always good, I usually get the strawberry crepe cakes or the chorizo hash and literally the chorizo has is one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. I like how they have different sizes for juice. And I like how service is usually pretty fast and food comes out quick. Some constructive criticism: The checks never come with the total just an itemized list with individual prices and they're usually illegible. The other thing is I think the creams sit on the tables all day and it makes me not want to use it."
"5.0","Wow! What a great find. Authentic Portuguese food cooked by the owner. Her childhood recipes to boot. Obviously she knows what she is doing. The lunch we had was amazing. We had the cod casserole and a octopus casserole. Both exceptionally delicious. My favorite was the Cod. Great prices, great service, an immaculately clean restaurant. Must go."
"1.0","Sitting here watching one of the counter staff wipe her nose on her shirt collar the pick at her nose with her fingers. This is scary."
"5.0","Very glad Yelp recommended this place to me. I came on a Friday evening at 6 PM and ordered a chicken sharmola sub for $8.55 after tax, which came with fries. Wait for food took about 13 minutes, a very reasonable time given the 1-2 customers before me.As for the food, all I can say is wow. The chicken was so, so tender and had a nice coating of spice. The bread was fresh and soft and packed with vegetables. The special beta bites dressing tasted like a variation of thousand island dressing perhaps mixed with curry and a touch of vinegar, and the slightly sour taste added a wonderful flavor to the sub. Also, the sub was huge - about 7-8 inches I'd say - as well as thick, so very fillingThe fries were also hot and seasoned well with salt and pepper, seemingly before cooked.I will definitely be back to try more items on the menu! I'm very impressed considering I usually never order subs since a lot of places only offer plain, boring options like turkey. This place had so many options that I could never get tiredYoung workers there are also very friendly!"
"3.0","Honestly, my mother LOVES this place whereas I on the other hand am not much a fan.  For me personally a pizza has to have a good sauce with flavor and spice. The crust has to have some volume. The cheese has to be melted and not like a thin sheet laid atop the pie. I enjoy eating pizza from here when it's my mother option to order....but for me, I need a thicker pizza with more flavor embedded into the sauce. Be sure to try it out for your self though and enjoy!"
"3.0","I'm lol'ing at some of the reviews here. People going on about freaking miso soup. 'Immortalizing the ingredients.' 'Exquisite.' Get a grip, people. Let me give it to you straight:- This place is better than you'd think for being in a touristy area. - It probably has the best sushi in Pittsburgh except for Umi.- But in any other big city it would probably be right in the middle of the pack- The fish quality is good- The assembly is poor (e.g. sloppy rolls, crumbling rice)If you've never had sushi in your life, this place is 5 stars. Otherwise, nothing to see here."
"5.0","One of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. Come with a heavy wallet or an expense account. The staff is always friendly and attentive. The food is always delicious. The bill is always high. And I always leave feeling it was worth it"
"5.0","If I didn't live in the neighborhood, I would have to come back to get Dora's Veggie sandwich. But I do live here and feel very lucky to be able to walk in and get high quality, locally sourced, usually organic foods from welcoming, friendly people. Every neighborhood should have such a market."
"1.0","Just way too loud for any kind of enjoyable experience.  Not the type of loud in which everyone is having a super fun time, just loud because of bad acoustics.  I'm really not into yelling at my dinner partners or the server and vise versa.  The noise level tainted any other experience of food or service."
"2.0","I've ordered catering from here several times for my company, and I was not too happy with my experience. For catering orders, you choose a 15 minute delivery window and they delivered 30 minutes after the end of the time frame. If it was just lunch for myself it would not have been an issue, but it was catering for a large event at my company, and it was a big issue that the food was late."
"5.0","If I could give this place more than five stars I would! The market section has an incredible range of middle eastern goods from candies to halal meat and a frozen section. The restaurant is straight up amazing! It's not much to look at but the food is to die for and the people who work there are always so nice! I go here at least once a week to shop and pick up lamb curry with paneer and fresh naan. You have to try this place!"
"5.0","This review is long overdue.  My wife and I go to Salem's at least once a week.  Usually we go for dinner on Friday night, or lunch on Saturday.  The staff there couldn't be more friendly.  I get the same thing every week - Chicken Tikka Masala with double cream spinach.  As you can see from the picture, it's delicious.  The portion sizes are always massive, and you never leave feeling hungry. Other than the Tikka Masala, I also took a bite of my sister-in-law's burger one time, which was also of very high quality.  I once had the lamb, but couldn't stray away from the Tikka Masala.  It's tender, and the sauce is amazing.  I will continue to go to Salem's once a week even when I move out of the city.  It's that good."
"4.0","I had a great lunch here with a friend.  Fun, creative menu.  Good friendly service.  Fresh local ingredients.  Nothing here not to like.  No fanfare, no hassle.TBH, I hope it doesn't become too popular.  There's a quiet laid back vibe to this place.  That could be lost if it gets too popular."
"4.0","When I worked in town, I ate here every week, and loved it, but after retiring 2 years ago, I was never in town until this weekend.  The food is as good as it ever was and they have remodeled the inside.Wonton soup was great, as well as the sweet and sour chicken, Kung bow chicken, and chicken fried rice.Service is always good and the fortune cookies crisp.  Don't forget when you read your fortune to add the words 'in bed' at the end.  Makes for a better fortune."

"4.0","The famous corned beef sandwich on Rye is the way to go!"
"4.0","If you're in Shadyside around breakfast or brunch time, Pamela's is a great place to grab something to eat. Note: It is a smaller diner and can quickly accumulate a wait time should it be a peak time (due to the size of the restaurant). However, if you're not willing to wait for a seat, they have a sister restaurant upstairs that serves brunch, as well.They offer a decent amount of breakfast and lunch options on their menu and the prices aren't too bad. My fianc√© and I went with the fan favorites (Tex Mex omelet and Gail's Favorite eggs). Both options came with toast and Lyonnaise potatoes. My fianc√© really liked his omelet and I enjoyed my dish, as well. My only wish was that the eggs and toppings were blended because my eggs weren't warm enough to melt the cream cheese and it was hard to mix. Our service was very fast and friendly and our food came out quickly after ordering (even with them being busy). Oh, and before visiting, make sure you have cash as that is all they accept for payment!"
"3.0","The location is prime and buffet pricing is good for lunch. However, the taste is not all that to my liking. They have chai too post-buffet which is a nice touch. Gives discounts to UPMC employees."
"4.0","Rialto looks pretty unassuming from the outside, but after trying unsuccessfully to find a pizza place to latch onto - one that could make a consistently great pizza - I tried Rialto, which just so happened to be the neighborhood pizza place.The pizza from there has always been fantastic.  A plain cheese is the perennial favorite, but with bonus points for their pineapple and onion pizza, which is out of this world.Their sides don't quite match up to their pizza... the Greek salad doesn't have much about it that could be Greek, the zucchini strips leave something to be desired.But I still keep going back for the pizza.  It also helps that they have a decent selection of beer."
"5.0","Awesome old building adds to the ambiance of this fun, great brewery. Beer is great and food is fantastic allbeit limiter. Street parking is easy and the feel is eclectic and hip."
"4.0","La Gourmandine is a great bakery to have nearby if you love French pastry. They have a good selection of different pasties everything from the basic croissant to multilayered cakes. The downtown location also has sandwiches and coffee in addition to some seating. The macarons are pretty good , but not the best and they never offer that many flavors- they are more of just a tacked on offering. There other pastries - like the marquise cake! Are much better. My only issues with this store is that it is super crowded at all times, there is very little seating, and ordering is very hard because of the set up of the long narrow counter which you have to walk the whole way down to see everything which is impossible when it it crowded. Also, it's pretty darn pricy (a lot of pasties are $4, macarons $1.65, full cakes $27.50) and if you want a full cake or pie call ahead or go early, they often only have one of each per day."
"5.0","Caffe Mona is probably one of the BEST brunch spots in Pittsburgh. Caner and Eto surprise you with flavor pairings that will blow your mind. The crepes range from savory to sweet and each bite is perfect. The service is amazing, it feels like you're dining with family. The best place to sit is on their back deck, which has an enchanting canopy of bright rainbow umbrellas."
"1.0","Ordered 2 large pepperoni pizzas and they still managed to mess that up. Gave me 2 plain pizzas instead. Then when my boyfriend tried to call and inform them of the mistake, they denied sending us the wrong pizza and hung up on him. He called back and once again they said sorry we can't help you. Excuse me? How about you give us the right pizza or a refund. The pizza isn't even great to begin with, so after this experience I would never recommend this place. Quite honestly I'd rather eat anything else."
"5.0","I live in Mt. Washington and The Summit is one of my favorite neighborhood spots. However, I would definitely recommend it as more of a cocktail bar than a restaurant. The food is only so-so. Its decent for some small bites bar snacks, but I would recommend this place for dinner. However, their cocktails are really well put together and delicious and they have a nice beer selection as well. I rarely make it in time for happy hour, but they also have good happy hour specials. They also have big bay windows that open up so its a really nice spot when the weather is nice and you kinda have a city view from certain angles. Overall, a great hangout spot to grab a drink with friends."
"4.0","Stopped in for brunch unexpectedly after a BYS yoga sesh. Small place but big on flavor and fun. My husband and myself shared the Breakfast Tacos and the Croque Madame breakfast sandwich. Honestly, both were so amazing I wish I didn't have to share (lol). The tomatillo salsa that came with the tacos is so delicious I think I'd put it on anything. I also enjoyed a Cap'n Crunch Punch, because why not? Definitely looking forward to making a second trip to try their happy hour!"
"4.0","The #7 is HUGE!! And delicious. Service was good although a bit slow for not being crowded but then again this isnt a 5 minute sammich"
"4.0","Love this place! All the food is delicious and lots of options, I always have a hard time deciding what I want to order, whether its the delicious pancakes or the croissant french toast (my mouth is watering just thinking about it!) The only thing I'm not a big fan of is the corned beef hash - super salty! But other than that, great portions, great taste, great atmosphere. It's cash only but there are multiple ATMs close-by so no excuse to not try this place if you haven't already!"
"5.0","This probably my favorite Chinese Place to get some pretty great Chinese food. The Sweet and Sour chicken is my favorite thing to get here.  The people are very nice and the service is great. The decor is nice and gives the place a very nice touch.  I really recommend my family and close friends to come here cause the food is very great."
"5.0","Best Thai in the states!!!! Doesn't get any better than here! The owners are Thai & they cook all the meals here themselves. Truly wonderful owners. Very kind people & the authentic taste of their foods is so out of this world!! They should charge much more for all their dishes... AND I'd pay more!!"
"5.0","Five stars all the way! This restaurant is located in the strip district of Pittsburgh. It features an urban ambience with clear garage doors on the front on the joint that can be opened if the weather is nice, and hand painted brick walls of sea creatures, waves and a giant ship. When we walked in the restaurant smelled delicious. It put me right in the mood for our meal. We went during lunch time which is when they offer a lunch menu with lunch friendly options and pricing. Our bill for four entrees, one appetizer and one beer was $83. They also have a pretty insane Bloody Mary menu. You can customize your own by adding bacon strips, shrimp and other goodies. They looked insanely good!Our server was amazing; super knowledgeable, friendly and gave great recommendations! He noticed my dad was drinking a TON of water and brought him a giant beer mug of water. Lol. The food was very tasty, unique, and was well presented. It was very appealing to the eyes!Towards the end of our meal, the owner's father (who is the owner of the fish market), came by our table to check on us and we ended up chatting for about 15 minutes. He was a very neat and interesting guy. I'd love to sit down with him over a beer. I definitely recommend checking this place out! Well worth it!"
"1.0","The food took forever to come out over an hour on a Saturday night when the place was not that busy. The restrooms were dirty as well"
"4.0","This is a great location in Mt. Washington, tucked back in the business district, off of the main overlook road.  It was a nice day, so the windows were open in the small restaurant.  They had a slushee stout, which tasted just like a mudslide, complete with fresh whipped topping.  The mussels were amazing with a tomato, garlic, chorizo sauce and the bread grilled perfectly for dipping.  I wanted more and bigger chunks of chorizo!  The fries were hot and crispy.  The wait staff was very friendly."
"3.0","I had heart quite a bit about this place before going and maybe the hype ruined it a little for me. Coming from a place of prime beef I found the waygu appetizer to be supremely underwhelming and lacking in flavor. The fish, although fresh just felt off and it felt as though the price of the fish indicated they were selling ambiance instead of a tasting experience. There are much higher quality sushi spots in Pittsburgh for a lower price. It's a nice place to go for a couple drinks and a small plate, but true sushi lovers may want to look elsewhere. I had the tako (octopus) sashimi and a rainbow roll, as well as several other sashimi pieces I can't recall."
"5.0","This is a trendy little spot in Lawrenceville that is very tricky to find. Even when you think you found it there's still four more doors leading up to the dining area you may mistake as the restaurant.The appetizers were amazing one of the things that surprised me is how good the chicken hearts were.Our table also really enjoyed the fried chicken and the squid. They have a private dining room where you sit on the floor to have your dinner. Our server was great and made great recommendations because we did not know we were ordering sometimes.We will be back"
"4.0","I used to drive by Caffe Mona every day while on my rotation at Children's Hospital, never realizing what a gem it is inside! I finally came here this past Sunday afternoon for brunch with some friends. We made reservations prior and we're seated right away. They have a beauuutiful patio with hanging umbrellas!!! Unfortunately due to the size of our group we were not able to be seated out there :(They have a $20 3-course brunch special which is so worth the price! For first course you can get a salad or plate of fruit, second course you can get any entree on the menu (omelette, French toast, crepes, bagels, sandwich), and for third course you get a crepe (Nutella banana, strawberry or apricot). Also included in the deal is a latte/cappuccino, or unlimited coffee/tea.  I got the fruit plate (so much fruit!), Mediterranean omelette, and the Nutella banana crepe with a soy latte. Everything was so delicious! And the food was plentiful (they didn't skimp considering it was a 3-course). My only criticism is it took a bit of time for our food to come out, but we were a group of 7 so I will attribute some of it to that. Overall, friendly, interactive staff and good food!"
"5.0","This place is a true north side establishment and that's why I love it.  It's raw.  You will wait while trying to place an order on the phone and upon arrival, however the pizza is the best bang for your buck! It's not the best pizza in Pittsburgh, but it is nice for the north siders who are trying to get their grub on- cheap!!  Pizza is def dee-licious , but not Rt.51 good!"
"1.0","Only giving 1 star because I can't give 0 stars. By far the worst Taco Bell in the city. I've been to this place twice and they were closed during business hours that they were supposed to be open. They mess up simple orders so often that I honestly question whether they just don't care or whether some of the stupidest people in the city of Pittsburgh are actually working here."
"5.0","It is hard not to compare KiKu with Chaya in Pittsburgh.  Both are Japanese-speaking Japanese Restaurant, both are on the pricey end (~$30/set). So allow me to do some pros and cons. Opening hours: Kiku is open 7 days a week, lunch and dinner.  Chaya has no lunch and not open on Sunday.Parking: KiKu is in Station Square, so there is a parking lot.  Having said that, parking that you pay for (extra $10 I think...)Food-wise:KiKu has better Toro. And often their Toro are included in the dinner set. So if you are a Toro fan, KiKu is for you. They have Chef's selection set as well, but they do not have set that includes scallops and uni (for certain).  I saw they have uni on the menu, but only ordered per piece. (uni sushi / $6, uni and egg / $6.5)I will just say Chaya has set that includes scallops and uni.  So if Toro is more important than variety, Kiku for sure. If you prefer variety more than just toro, you might need to try both."
"4.0","Great place for tacos! It's small and cozy. Perfect for a quick bite and take out. I had the carnitas and pollo tacos. To my surprise, they had a big selection of hot sauces. I'd recommend the mango habanero! Will visit again!"
"1.0","Belligerent bartender, dirty dishes and broken glassware. Ordering my first (and only) round went smoothly. Conversely, when I noticed my mug had a chip in it, I politely asked for a replacement. The bartender, showing a great deal of condescension, acted as though this was a ridiculous request and illustrated his thoughts by pouting like a petulant child as he poured the beer from my damaged glass into a unclean replacement. Ignoring the poor cleanliness of my second mug, as I was sensing some enmity, I continued with what I thought was proper decorum. I spared him the lesson on classical physics yet tried to explain that the glass chip may have fallen inside my beer, therefore, I would like a new draft. I also added that because I had already had a few drinks from my original, it would be perfectly acceptable for him to pour me only half a glass. I could see that he was already precariously perched at the precipice of cantankerous conduct and possibly personally offended. Apparently, rational thought before asking for half a beer poured into a new glass (or on which to base any decision) became too much for him to handle. This is what must have sent him plummeting over the edge onto the behavior which I base my review.  With arduous focus maintaining a prison yard stare, he slammed both mugs into the sink. At the sound of broken glass I reconsidered explaining the basic principles of physics with an augmentation in decision-making to thwart his poor life choices and their repetitive cycles. However the amplified air of hostility and roll of his eyes made me confident that he now understood how we ended up in this conundrum. Explication would be redundant and conceivably harmful. I nonchalantly looked away in an effort to prevent this volatile situation from reaching critical mass. My labors to recover the situation were rewarded with a full glass of beer crashed onto the bar where it spilled over the sides to become a half glass of beer with a wet and sticky grip. I let it go, after all, I didn't come here with the futile notion of educating a bartender in the suitable customs and cultures of civilized society. If I ever hear anyone mention patronizing this place I'll instead recommend a trip to the great ape exhibit at the Pittsburgh Zoo. From my experience the apes at the zoo exercise a more appropriate demeanor. After the way I was treated I'm embarrassed to have spent money here. Fortunately there are a plethora of superior alternatives within walking distance."
"3.0","It's ok not great, they could really benefit from a refresh, it felt and looked dirty..."
"5.0","Came on a Wednesday for breakfast, the place was empty and we were sat immediately. The farmer crepe and chevre omelette we ordered were both delicious. The back porch with all the colorful umbrellas is a great place to chill out and enjoy your meal."
"5.0","Beautiful space, love that they source from our local Mediterra Bakery, a variety of seating options. I thoroughly enjoyed their cod bites, the butter and cheese breakfast roll (with blackberry jam!), and ice tea. Wanted to buy the sparkling mineral water and a jam variety to go (fig, pumpkin and others), maybe next time! Wednesday lunch time had tables to spare (12:30pm)"
"5.0","Hands down our favorite spot we've tried in Pittsburgh. The staff is super friendly, the drinks are delicious, and the atmosphere is awesome. We took advantage of the happy hour specials and enjoyed the Moscow mule, cucumber press, bohemian forest, and mont brouilly cocktails. The Mont Brouilly was my favorite. We also tried the cheese plate which was delicious. Highly recommend!"

"1.0","This was a horrible experience at this store!!  I never had such rude customer service. I was treated like they just wanted to get me out of the store as quickly as possible and just threw my sandwich together really sloppy and rude like they did not want me there in that store.  I will never be back!!!"
"4.0","We like the pizza and hoagies.  The wings are also good.  I'm editing my review as I noticed they resolved the two complaints I had with them.  The delivery is always fast and they have a good variety of items on their menu."
"4.0","Although the hostess seemed put out at having to seat us, and my first napkin was still damp, everything else was pretty good. I enjoyed the Pierogi flatbread, which tasted like a loaded baked potato, as well as the enormous baby kale salad. The macaroni and cheese was declared delicious, as well as the street tacos, which were surprisingly spicy but still edible. The burger was good too. The table concluded that the broccoli was overcooked but excellently seasoned. Word to the wise: the desserts are enormous. The cake was five layers and could have fed a family of four. The brownies with ice cream was likewise quite large, something like four servings. Brownies were good. Our server handled our booth have sex with aplomb. We are lucky we got in on a weak and that wasn't a game day."
"3.0","Decent burger place that opened in the Lawrenceville area. Apparently this place is well known in the North Hills area and they decided to open a location in the city. Great timing as I was coming off work & decided to drop by to try their wares. Ended up taking a Maggie's Farm (smoked gouda, horseradish, caramelized onions, roasted chilies, rum aioli, plus patty [medium rare, I chose]) and a half side of rosemary fries to go. As for the fries, they were decent though I found the rosemary a bit overpowering to my taste buds. Would recommend they go a little lighter with the use of such seasoning in general. As for the burger itself? Pretty good overall. I wouldn't place the patty quality as good as that of BRGR or Burgatory as it was also rather lacking in flavor/juice, but I'd probably consider such passable and better than fast food burger patties (a slight step up). It's nice that they have a build-your-own option though that's probably more expensive, sandwiches, shakes, sodas, salads, other sides, and more so that's a plus for food variety. Will have to try other things and update accordingly. Overall though, would recommend other places to go for better tasting burgers."
"5.0","Such a great experience eating here! Thank you For the delicious food Umami and for the incredible service.  I truly left Pittsburgh feeling as if I had found a new special spot to revisit, in the future!"
"5.0","Just ordered the Mediterranean Hoagie + Eggplant Parm Hoagie last night and had it delivered at 1AM. Not only were they delicious and huge (saved half for lunch the next day), but they were one of the only places open in Pittsburgh who actually delivers past midnight. And they have a huge vegetarian selection. Highly recommended."
"3.0","Mediocrity at its best. I got the sausage egg and cheese croissant with a coffee, and it came to $13.50- pretty overpriced if you ask me. The food was decent- sausage and potatoes were extremely greasy but still tasty. It was also disproportional. The egg was omelette styled and massive compared to the croissant. Im not sure if there is a single person on this planet who could fit the whole thing in their mouth. I ate the sandwich with a knife and fork. Coffee was terrible- not surprising, though. Service was really fast. You order at the register and they will assign your party a table, and they will bring you your food when it's ready. They have two self service water dispensers, one plain and one infused with cucumber. Love that! I will be returning, though next time around, I'll probably choose one of the lunch sandwiches. Overall, a fine experience. I'm willing to give it another chance!"
"4.0","My husband and I were downtown to see a show and stumbled upon Redbeards after encountering a wait at the restaurant we had planned to dine at beforehand. Redbeards was busy on a Friday evening around 5:30, but they had tables available (they have two spaces, upstairs and downstairs). They call themselves a sports bar, and there certainly are some TVs, but the music was turned up SO LOUD that it made the place feel almost club-like. Anyway, from 4-6 on Mondays through Fridays they have happy hour specials, so we were able to catch the tail end of those... $2.00 off appetizers, as well as drink specials. The menu is mostly pretty standard bar fare. We ordered 3 appetizers (pretzel sticks, mozzarella logs, and pierogies), as well as a half dozen wings. Well, let me clarify...we attempted to order a half dozen wings. The music was so loud that it was hard to converse with the waitress (and ourselves, frankly), so she must've thought we just said a 'dozen' wings, because that's what we were brought. Similarly, we tried to order queso sauce with our pretzel sticks, but I don't think she heard that either, because the dip accompanying the pretzels was definitely not queso. The food was solid bar food. The mozzarella logs were big rectangular hunks of fried cheese with a tasty marinara dipping sauce...who can't get on board with that? Frankly, I might eat all of my food in log shapes from now on. The pretzel sticks were soft and warm with just the right amount of salt. My biggest complaint about those is that I didn't care for the dipping sauce that accompanied them. I have no idea what it was, but it definitely wasn't the queso we ordered. Maybe a mustard of some kind? It had a really strong fake smoke flavor that I hated, although my hubby thought it was super tasty, so different strokes, I guess. The pierogies were also respectable. Not the best I've ever had by a long shot, but they were seasoned well and had plenty of fluffy potato and cheddar filling. I would've liked them to be a little more buttery and served with onions, but they were pretty tasty as is. Lastly, the honey mustard wings were quite delicious. They were perfectly fried, very meaty, and the sauce was sweet and tangy. Overall, we were satisfied with our food, especially since everything (except the wings) was $2 off because of the happy hour. If we had paid full price, however, I'd probably be less pleased, because the regular prices here are very expensive (both food and drinks). You're definitely paying a premium for the location. Note that if you check in on Yelp (at least as of the time of this review), you'll receive 10% off of your bill, but it's not valid on already-discounted food (i.e. happy hour) or any alcohol. Service was very prompt and efficient.I'll probably return when I'm in the area during happy hour....I just hope next time they'll turn down their damn music! (Why yes, I do have a collection of children's frisbees that have landed in my yard, why do you ask?) :)"
"5.0","Absolutely excellent sashimi & sushi They serve super fresh and thick pieces salmon and tuna. I will go back definitely"
"5.0","The catering options are wonderful. My department orders from Sausalido every week, and the food is always prompt and delicious.

"5.0","Yesterday, after a hard day of cleaning, Chris and I ventured out late at night (aka 9) to grab a bite. I have been wanting to go here since I saw reviews popping up for this place. It is close so we made a reservation with open table and got right in.If you cannot climb steps due to joints/vertigo/anything this is not the place for you. The steps up to the restaurant are steep and you have to go two flights up. It is a warning for those who might not make it. This place was thumping for a Tuesday night! I could not believe how packed it was. People were at tables, at the bar, and at the sushi bar! The tables are all high tops (eh) with backed chairs (a plus). Our table slightly sloped so that when we moved our water to the right it slid off the table along with my glass. I do not know if the table was sloped, the floor was sloped, or if the table was so waxy that it just slid right off. After that we kept our food and drinks to the left. So we started with the bites! These all were grilled on little wooden skewers. It was nice to be able to watch your food being cooked in the open kitchen. ROBATAYAKI W/TARE & TOGARASHI:Japanese eggplant -- Three medallions of eggplant. It was grilled perfectly and had a great taste to it. Chris and I both agreed for $1.5 we would get it again.Beef tenderloin -- Again about 4 pieces of tenderloin on a skewer. These pieces were really good. The marinade plus the grilling flavor, yum. But the bites were smaller than a bite so while good, probably not again. Then we moved to our 'main course' which I say in quotes because Chris decided he was not going to get a real meal but just dumplings.YATAI:Pork Gyoza: pan fried pork & cabbage pot stickers, rayu shoyu. Ok, at first I argued with him about this. I was like, 'this is $8, I could buy a bag for cheaper than that....' But I was glad that he talked me into it. These were not the usual frozen from a bag from the strip gyoza. These were handmade, delicious, and we ordered two of them. TWO! After Chris devoured one plate he said, 'can we get another?' I was not about to tell him no. They were fried together into a circle and had thin cut hot peppers that were slightly fried. I only ate THREE dumplings out of the two orders we got. He really enjoyed them. Tonkotsu Ramen: pork char siu, bamboo shoots, 5:10 egg, scallion, nori. I am a fan. This was a great dish. I will say that the waiter said it was totally split-able but in my opinion (so take that as you may) it really wasn't. There wasn't enough meat/broth/noodles to get a full split. I mean, I could have had more noodles and broth just for me. I really liked it here. It was a little dark so I didn't take pictures, we were seated pretty close to another couple and I didn't want to ruin their night by flashing pictures! Can't wait to go back!"
"3.0","I will make this quick because we only ordered lo mein and a eggroll for takeout. I happen to agree with Lucretiz about the eggrolls...way too much goop. It made me feel like mush mouth when I took a bite. So, we won't do that ever again. I do have a good word about the chicken lo mein tho. Let the church say 'Amen'! The chicken was juicy and flavorful but not overly salty which is perfect. The veggies mixed in were fresh and full of flavor. It was worth the bill. While the food from here wasn't stellar, it was good enough to make me keep the menu to order takeout again in the future. They've been in business for a long time and it was packed when I dropped in-- good sign. Crowds say a lot to me so I can't wait to order something different for us next time."
"5.0","Awesome! The turkey burger was amazing and my server George was the the best. I'd definitely go back. 5 stars!!! Keep up the good work Bus!"
"5.0","1000/10. Would always go again. I got the Morning After special with a side of wheat toast and a hot chocolate. The crepe pancakes are amazing, their wheat toast is huge, they know how to make eggs and keep them warm, the bacon is delicious and very flavorful, and the whipped topping on the hot cocoa was abundant and tasted natural. Service was fast (got my food in less than 5 minutes) and very friendly too."
"5.0","European ambience and great patio with umbrellas, I ordered chicken pesto salad that was really good with fresh ingredients, servers are nice, def coming back thx guys"
"3.0","I dined here for the first time about a month ago when I met a friend for an impromptu dinner date.  I'd been wanting to try the food here for quite a long time so when my friend asked where I wanted to eat that night, I suggested that we meet here.  We arrived around 6 PM on a Tuesday evening and the place was completely empty, which made me a little nervous, and overall our visit was mediocre at best.  We were seated near the window, which typically happens when a restaurant is empty - they try to give the appearance of having customers in the restaurant.  Our silverware was dirty and we had to ask for fresh, the waitress explained that the silverware had been set up on Saturday night just before they closed as the reason that the silverware had food particles on it (they are closed on Sundays and Mondays).  I ended up ordering East Coast Caesar with salmon and my friend had the Beets and Bleu salad.  The salads were fine, but really they were just that - 'fine' and reminded of countless others that I've over the years at various restaurants around the US and granted, it's 'just a Caesar salad' but I've had some spectacular ones and some really awful ones and this fell squarely in the passable but nothing remarkable category.  I do want to give them a second chance and perhaps try and entree the next time as maybe they were having an off night.  I will post an update if I go again, but as for now, my review stands at 3 stars."
"2.0","Good food. Service was horrible. One of the workers was extremely rude and made comments about what his customers were wearing. He claimed he was going to kick out his customers for wearing low cut shirts. The other workers just laughed it off. Whoever owns this place should learn to hire respectful staff. Shame because they're tacos were actually decent."
"1.0","Ordered delivery, never came. Called restaurant and the man told me I had ordered it for pick up. I didn't but ok I asked him to send it please. Three hours later I called back and he told me first that it had been picked up in store. Wrong. Told me a completely different order twice before finding my order from 4 hours earlier and insisted for the second time it would take a half hour. Don't order from here unless you want to argue with a man who keeps calling you 'honey'."
"2.0","Salumi Plate - asked waiter, specifically, what was on plate.  He said '4 types of salami and one of something else'.  It arrived and was only 2 salami's and 3 other things my partner nor I would eat.  Disappointing he was so uninformed and just defensive.   The pizza's -- one was FAR TOO SALTY, had to ask to remake without putting salt on it.  The pizza chef went nuts with the salt.  Pistachio/porchetta pizza was VERY heavy, not thin crust, me thinks.  Charred broccoli was the best of the dishes.  So, not planning to return.  Mezzo=mediocre, disappointing."
"2.0","To sum it up, the food is decent/good but the service was very bad.  Be warned - It took about an hour and 10 minutes for our food to come out for brunch last Sunday.  We're talking pancakes and omelets.   And it wasn't even full when we went in - the patio was full but there were several empty tables in the inside area.   The kitchen must be an unorganized chaos; they need serious help back there."
"2.0","Over-priced and mediocre. I had the pear appetizer, which was lacking in any discernible flavor, and a green salad which I swear had those same onions in a can you use for green bean casserole at Thanksgiving. The service was stupid and even though I said I was a vegetarian, they did not volunteer that the peppers that came with my bread were cooked in pork fat till I asked what they were (why did they bring those to a vegetarian at all?). I had a delicious cocktail to start the meal, which is responsible for one of the two stars I am awarding Mezzo."
"4.0","I see a lot of potential with Freshii. I would give them 5 stars if they weren't too shy with the seasoning in some food items like flavorless rice or the parfaits."
"1.0","My daughter and I were excited about trying this place for weeks and finally had the opportunity this past week.  We were disappointed.  The atmosphere was extremely generic and had no unique character.  The service was average, at best.  And although the burgers werent bad, they were no better than the ones I make at home.  And then finally.....2 burgers 2 orders of french fries, and 2 waters.....$32.24 with tip.  Needless to say, the next time I have a hankering for a burger, I'll just make it myself"
"1.0","The food is awesome, but Tamarind is poorly managed. Don't order form them on Yelp. I've had so many issues with my online orders that I honestly can't remember all of them. I almost never receive my food within two hours. I've been on the phone with Grubhub customer service because of Tamarind orders at least five times now, it's just unbelievable. They actually called me this time! I feel bad for the delivery drivers because they probably get blamed, but this is definitely Tamarind's problem. They shouldn't offer this service if they aren't capable of performing."
"5.0","We always enjoy coming here when we are in the North Shore! Our waiter was top notch, knowledgeable about the menu, and prompt with all our needs. Keep training them well!!"
"5.0","The East Carson Street Pizza Gauntlet Part 5: The ConclusionThe three of us; Kay, her brother RJ, and I were battle-weary. I was feeling especially overloaded since I'd also had pizza twice the previous day. After resting at the Burger King, we found ourselves cold, stuffed with food, and slightly dejected that the last pizza place we wanted to try had changed hands and morphed into a rowdy bar. There was, however, one more place that caught my eye, a parlor I didn't know was on Carson until tonight. To recap, we encountered the 4 sisters; Zeeno's the fun, happy, pleasingly plump one. Sal's the darling dimbulb, Pizza Sola is the gorgeous geek, and Pi is the duplicitous doxy. Lo there would be a 5th sister, one that would snatch the breath from my lungs and run with it, daring me to chase her down for it, giggling playfully all the while like Catwoman stealing diamonds only because it ensures that Batman will be in hot pursuit. Gennaro's is the mystery blonde from either 'Fast Times At Ridgemont High' or 'American Graffiti.' I kept catching glimpses of her throughout the evening, encountering her briefly only to lose her in the crowd. We arrived at a small pizzeria with only the aforementioned sign in the window. We were the only customers. The seating was sparse, the decor minimal. The trend had been seemingly reversed drastically. I stupidly asked 'Do you sell pizza by the slice here?'Everyone chuckles, including my companions. I could blame it on a long, busy day, but in truth, I was just blinded by her beauty. No, not the girl behind the counter. Jeez, she looked to be about 15 and was preoccupied with her iPhone and makeup mirror. I'm talkin' about a pizza that comes out of the shadows, walkin' like a dream, makin' me crazy, makin' me feel so mean. Suddenly, I was Freddie Wilson...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmf8rZfGTKQ&feature=relatedMy compadres had no appetite. I barely did either, but I took a few bites and had it boxed up. I didn't want to tax my stomach any further. Or did the pizza slice want to play hard-to-get? The pizza already gave off an aroma akin to perfume. You could see the spices and herbs in the sauce. The cheese was oily or rather, glowing. One doesn't call a pizza like this 'greasy.' The pepperoni turned into perky, crispy little goblets. The crust was built like a brick shithouse with a soft side. Instantly, it was a perfect 10.  But again, I only got a taste. I would take it home and not revisit it until the next day. That's when she came out of her shell. It was even better after toasting it in the oven to reheat it. This 5th sister was obscure, unattainable when you first noticed her, but after pining for her for months, you finally took her home after she became tipsy, only to allow her to sleep it off in your bed while you took the couch. The next morning, she awakened wearing your clothes with a breakfast prepared for you on the table, not due to any patriarchal need to please but rather because she likes to cook for people and woke up starving. After that it was a few hours of Nintendo during which you discovered that she's a gifted, knowledgeable gamer, all before the Steelers came on, of course (she's a fan!). A week later she was keeping toiletries at your place. A year later it was co-habitation. 3 years later you're both standing at the altar side-by-side. Zeeno's is weeping and smiling, anticipating the birth of your first child so she can babysit. Sal's is bored and eager for the reception so she can self-medicate with free alcohol. Pizza Sola can't wait for it to be over since she thinks marriage is archaic but came only because she loves her sister dearly despite fighting with her over silly things many times while growing up. Pi's is just bitter, hates what everyone's wearing, and is wondering how much money your obese and balding boss, whom you had to invite, makes and whether or not he and his wife get along.The One, The Love of Your Life, was found at Gennaro's. Thus ended our adventure. No, I never expected that the last pizza I would try would be my favorite. There was no poetic license at work here, I swear. Gennaro's is the true gem of South Side's slightly disappointing pizza scene.P.S. Thanks to Kay's brother and trained chef RJ for providing valuable insights during our excursion."
"3.0","We went on Saturday.  Service was ok, very disorganized.  Took well over an hour to get our food.  My food and my husbands food were both wrong.  Disappointing."
"5.0","I'm kinda sad to see any bad reviews of Alexander's on here. But come on people, who can actually write a review of an ITALIAN restaurant when they've only eaten the tuna or a hoagie? PASTA is in their name, so you should probably try the PASTA before commenting on something that isn't their SPECIALTY. Sorry for the sarcasm.I've been going to Alexander's for years, and I can't remember ever getting a bad meal. I love that you can pick what kind of pasta you want, what sauce, and the toppings. My favorite is the marfredo sauce. It is spaghetti sauce mixed with alfredo sauce. So freakin good!!! My only 'issue' is that they never seem to add enough sauce on your pasta, but you can ask for some extra on the side and they bring you a little bowlful. It's perfect!!!I get hot sausage on top (which isn't too spicy) and broccoli (which is always steamed just right, so it's not limp). The bread always comes with olive oil and parmesean cheese that you can dip it in. I love that.  We always get a carafe of their Chianti. It seems to go really well with the pasta. And lastly, the price is right. Why pay $20 for a plate of pasta? Alexander's agrees. With wine and 2 dinners, we get outta there for under $50. Not bad.This is an all-around good italian restaurant. Sorry to the haters, but this place blows Joe Mama's outta the water!!!"
"5.0","I heard so much about this place and wanted to try it for some time. The situation was perfect when the traffic and parking on Penn Avenue were telling me to go no further.  As I walked in, I was pleasantly surprised by the large, orderly space.  I was quickly greeted at the counter, where I placed my order for a chicken shawarma salad.  After being given a number to display on my table, I sat down and enjoyed watching the activity and meals around me.  Within minutes, my meal arrived.  The lettuce was fresh, the chicken was abundant and steaming, and dressings were provided.  As I sat eating my flavorful meal, I noted the food items I saw others eating and resolved to return and try a variety.  I also noted the steady stream of people at the counter, which moved quickly for a Sunday afternoon lunch rush.I was impressed by the smooth operation of this establishment.  Most notably, the service throughout my visit was so friendly and gracious toward all customers that I observed.  I look forward to returning!"
"4.0","As I continue to travel, I indulge in random, some times hole in the wall places or more trendy upscale places. The Summit is a great spot for my 4th meal ever in this city. But before I comment on the food. Let's start with the Glogg: a warm mix of cab, port, almonds raisins and a few other details. Wow. On a cold winter day, I can only ask why no other bar/resto serves this. Truly enjoyed this drink..As for the food menu, it's the perfect size. A few snacks, a few small plates and then some large. I went for the pork dumplings, delicious! The stuffing is well seasoned and the soy sauce come out warm with a slight kick. I could've eating a box! I finished with some mussels, which were enjoyable. Two details I would change are the chorizo and the toasted bread. The chorizo is not as bold and if it were a nice ground Spanish/Mexican chorizo I think the flavor profile would go along way. And the toast, it would probably be better with buttered/olive oiled French bread rather than sliced white bread.. The. Bartenders were both extremely friendly and welcoming. Explaining the seasonal items and rotating menu. I didn't have any other cocktails, but they all looked great! For a Monday night alone, Tuesday date night, or with friends, be sure to check this place out!"
"5.0","The Num Num was WOW, the Fig and Turkey sandwich was HUGE and delicious, the Egg and Cheese Bagels were standard but delicious, and the  Apple and Brie Crepe was good (but not great). Overall, the food came in huge portions, and tasted amazing on a Saturday morning at 11am when accompanied by some coffee and sunshine."
"4.0","Chinatown Inn serves up tasty dishes in a very short amount of time. I have been seated for lunch and out the door in about 30 minutes. Perfect for a downtown lunch break when you have one of those massive cravings for Chinese food.A waitress will take your order quickly, and provide iced tap water (not a fan of the taste) and a pot of black tea (very good). A typical lunch special for me that comes in under $10 is General Tso's chicken with white rice, and either a bowl of soup or an egg roll.The two adjoining dining rooms are very nice and clean with a combination of booths and tables. There also seems to be a small bar in the back of the dining room where you first walk in, but I haven't had a chance to explore what they offer.Definitely give it a try."
"4.0","Found this burger place while searching for a late afternoon bite. The burger was quality and the fries were nice & crispy. Waitress was really pleasant and personable. I'd come back again."
"3.0","So I'm giving Mezzo Three stars. Which they are receiving for the attentive wait staff, wine, and ambiance. I personally was not impressed with the food at Mezzo. I ordered a margarita pizza which was placed on top of an old tomato sauce can, which I thought was clever; however, the two person table I was seated at was a bit small for this set up. The pizza itself looked good, but came out tepid. The basil leaves were rather large and unfortunately there were a lot of them on the pizza, so they overpowered the thin, insipid sauce. I ended up having a few slices left over, but I let my date take those home. I'm a huge fan of pizza, so if that isn't good then I'm probably going to sulk the rest of the evening. Overall, the whole building is zero for two with me. I hope when I try the first floor meatball place I'm impressed or I will not be coming back to dine at any of the three levels."
"5.0","Very tasty French Toast with Spanikopita! Good prices, friendly staff. Would definitely come back to try the other items in their menu. The french toast is big and I could not even finish!!"
"4.0","For 3 bucks a slice of pepperoni, that was a good slice of pizza. I was there at 11:30, the day after Christmas so it wasn't really crowded. But, I did like the pizza. That was the only thing I had there so I can only judge on that.People were nice, got my order up quick.If I get a chance to I'll stop by again."
"4.0","A bit crowded, but amazing blueberry and strawberry pancakes. I fought to go here and waited about 20 mins for a table (weekend) but it was totally worth it."
"4.0","Stopped in for dinner the night before our visit to the University of Pittsburgh with one of my kids.  We were quite hungry and ordered both appetizers and main course.  In summary, this was really very good Indian food, definitely exceeded our expectations for Pittsburgh.Appetizers were Samosas and chicken with Manchurian sauce.  The samosas were tasty, well cooked and served with a very nice plum  sauce.  The chicken dish was delicious!  Coated, fried chicken pieces topped with a fantastically hot and spicy sauce.  Highly recommended and we would order again.Main course was chicken tikka masala, mutter paneer and shrimp korma.  The best of the three was the mutter paneer, peas and paneer in a creamy sauce.  Next best, the chicken masala had a great sauce, but the chicken was a little overcooked and a tad tough.  Bringing up the rear was the shrimp dish, again sauce was good but the shrimp got lost in the dish. We also ordered the bread basket, a mix of different types of Naan and Roti.  Greta deal, and the bread was delicious,Will we come back?  Without a doubt."
"4.0","We stopped here for apps and dinner the other night. The atmosphere was lively with a DJ and lots of young people. I would return for a cocktail and apps. I had the pork ribs ramen and it was just OK. The rib meat was pretty tough and the broth was not so tasty."
"2.0","Ordered a burger combo with Lettuce Ketchup and Mayo. What did i get a burger with onions and tomatoes on it. Two things i hate. Smh. I will say the food wood was good and would have rated higher if my order was correct"
"5.0","Doce is the best! My first time in I made the mistake of ordering flour instead of corn tortillas, luckily they made me try the corn because that makes all the difference!  The carnitas are delicious and the weekly specials can be great too!  This is my go-to place in the south side, dinner or late night. Also, I don't typically like beans, but theirs even get me.... I'll put Doce up there as tied for the best tacos in the city!"
"5.0","Yinz goin dahn to Sammy's for corned beef sammich n'at? The answer to this question should always be yes. Sammy's may not be the nicest bar, but its a very Pittsburgh bar. If you know that is a compliment then this is the place for you. Tender meat on local bread is not a good enough discription. I love Sammy's, its a pick me up after a hard day. The meat, cheese, and bread sorta meld together to become a smooth buttery burst of flavor.  I suggest 'the special half and half Pittsburgh style with everything on marble rye and a potatoe salad' half corned beef half pastrami  with thousand island dressing 'pittsburgh style' means with Cole slaw on top comes with a pickle . The potatoe salad is nothing special but it completes the meal. The beer is cheap with an ipa on tap for 3.50 so drinking suggested. The only suggestion I have is get some Turners tea up in this place!"
"3.0","We had the MVP burger and the Hall of Fame Burger. Both were great and properly cooked. The french fries were hot, and crispy.  One of the burgers were supposed to have coleslaw on it, but it came with lettuce instead. The fries had a little bit too much salt.Our server seemed to be in zombie mode (Sam, I think).  We never got napkins or flatware; When we asked for napkins, we got paper cocktail napkins, not the cloth type at the other tables.  When we pointed out that we never received flatware, so that she wouldn't think we stole it, she blamed it on someone else. We had to repeatedly ask for refills on water and soda. Her heart is definitely not in the game.The bathroom (women's) were messy, the floors were very sticky, and there were wadded used towels on the sink top.  We were in the house around 2:30 PM on a Saturday afternoon."
"1.0","Ordered pizza on Grubhub and the deep dish was under cooked and doughy.  They also did not include one of the toppings I paid for.  Not worth it!"
"5.0","This place is great. We've been wanting to try it since it opened and stopped in for breakfast today. We had breakfast sandwiches and home-fries, both of which were delicious. I also had one of the best lattes I've found in bloomfirlf. Very chill vibe and super friendly staff. Will definitely come again!"
"5.0","Food was excellent! I love this place because it has amazing quality food but the atmosphere is so fun yet relaxed. It's definitely not some stuffy seafood restaurant. I had the crab stuffed salmon and my husband had the shrimp and scallops. Both were amazing and very filling! We also had small salads to start and I have to say that the lemon ginger dressing g was the best dressing I have ever eaten. They seriously need to bottle that up and sell it because I would buy a case!!! The only thing that I would say that was not perfect was the fact that I didn't know they served sushi. I'm not sure if you have to ask for that menu because we didn't get to look at it. I only knew because the table beside us got some. I would have definitely ordered that as an appetizer if I had known. Looking forward to going back and trying the lobster bisque fries... Who ever thought of that must be a genius because they sound amazing!!!"
"5.0","My husband and I grabbed a late lunch here this past weekend. We hit the jackpot because they just happened to be in the middle of their Crab Fest. Our waitress was named Tammy and she was fantastic. The service was great for sure! We had the saut√©ed calamari as an appetizer and a sample dish as part of their crab fest special feature. It had a full lobster, a pound each of King, Snow, and Dungeness crab legs, corn and Yukon gold potatoes. The atmosphere was great! We had a nice two seater table outside and were able to have a nice conversation. We will definitely be back. The food and service was impeccable. We also enjoyed some cocktails and shots. Overall a wonderful experience."
"3.0","Eh, I wasn't particularly impressed with my time at Redbeard's.The good: On Wednesdays all day, they have all you can eat wings and chips for $10. Great deal considering 10 wings off of their menu are $10 themselves. You can only choose one flavor at a time. You start off with ten and then receive them by 5's. For my first batch, I tried the honey bbq which was good (i love honey bbq) The second batch, I ordered the Redbeard's Signature sauce- sweet chili sauce, BBQ sauce & some hot sauce. I really enjoyed that sauce. Their chips are nice too and are seasoned with a litte kick of something.. can't put my finger on it.The Average: Everything else. Our service really wasn't too good. She seemed to be new and we waited awhile to put in our order. In her defense, I do believe she was new  because she pulled out a list whenever we asked her what the craft beer options were. For drinks, we started off with a long island each.. terrible! Too much Sours were in that drink which literally can ruin the drink.. and it did. Also, at the end of the night we found out that each long island was $12. wtf?! $24 on 2 crappy drinks? We gulped the drink to get it over with then ordered 2 vodka and orange juice.. aka a tall glass of OJ and a splash of vodka. So in conclusion on drinks.. We spent $20 each on drinks  ($40 total) and didnt even walk out of there with a buzz. -_- Also, Bobby ordered the stuffed mushrooms with crab (appetizer) to eat. It was completely bland and both the mushroom and crab were not seasoned. It would've been completely delicious with a nicely seasoned mushroom and a tad of old bay on the crab.The menu seemed large and had nice selections.. pub food plus some entrees. If we do stop back it will be for all you can eat wings.. and we will stop there. Totally disappointed with both the food & drinks for what the final bill ended up being :("
"4.0","Wood-fired pizza that hits the spot. These guys have been at the traveling food truck/stand game for awhile and they excel at it. It's always going to be a good event when you see them parked, cooking and serving up yummy pizza.Prices range $9-$12 per pizza and not sold in slices. Pizza size is equivalent to four small-medium slices.The margherita pizza bursts with flavor from fresh mozzarella, basil and red sauce."
"5.0","Stopped in with a co-worker on a recommendation from a bartender on the north shore. We were working as photographers up at the Tough Mudder in Slippery Rock this weekend, and the event put us up in a hotel in Cranberry. Neither of us had been to Pittsburgh before, and we had driven out from Maine for this job, so we decided to use Sunday afternoon to explore downtown, not having any idea what to expect. I was told by many people that we HAD to get up on Mt. Washington just to see the view of the skyline, if nothing else. While having beers at a bar over by PNC Park, I asked the bartender where to get dinner, and he said we needed to get into The Summit...so we did, and what a great decision that was. Absolutely everything about the place was awesome. Extremely friendly and conversational staff, fantastic cocktail menu, and the food was incredible! Highly recommend the smoked gouda mac & cheese. That, along with the mixed olives and a couple of cocktails was one of the best meals I've had in a long time! If you're visiting Pittsburgh, get up to Mt. Washington, check out the view (especially after dark), and get dinner or even just drinks at The Summit!"
"5.0","The best sandwiches in the city. It's the most low-key bar in the city. If you want to grab a sandwich and a sixer this is the place."
"4.0","Hidden in the underground tunnel below the USX Steel Tower, this little place dishes out a funky vibe to go along with the sandwiches and wraps they create.Breakfast provides several great burrito and sandwich options. Lunch sandwiches are all different and good.Today I had the chicken sandwich and a side of Mac and Cheese. I added some Buffalo Chicken to the Mac for an extra $2. I have also had the 'Porkgasm' sandwich before which was also good.There is always fun music playing out of this place that goes along great with the playful, upbeat atmosphere and the staff. In the summer months they also have a tent outside USX Tower serving mostly tacos."
"5.0","Honestly, never been here, but I want to give a shout out to this particular Eat N Park. My friend recently visited and here is his quote:'We had a fantastic hostess at enp who happened to have his pronouns on his name tag to allow for his identity while in transition! Glad enp is open and allowing its staff to be who they are!!!!'Thank you Banksville ENP for rolling with the times!"
"5.0","Cute place with soft welcoming decor. Felt welcomed as soon as I walked in. Dishes were simple and delicious. Seating was a bit limited but we found a seat in the back facing the television. I picked up a pineapple chocolate to go for the road."
"4.0","We visited for my BFs 31st birthday! It was super nice, very upscale and the food did not disappoint. We have definitely had better steaks but they were still absolutely delicious. As were the mashed potatoes!! I couldn't stop eating them. It's definitely a special occasion type of place, and it wasn't cheap. But I'd say this is the type of place to splurge if you're going to. They even brought out a complimentary dessert for his birthday, and had confetti and a card on the table for him. I thought it was a nice touch!  Service was great as well."
"4.0","Capital Grille is consistently very good. It's this consistency that brings me back. I've dined at many Capital Grilles in different cities, and they never let me down. The steaks are top notch and always cooked to proper temperature. Medium is pink in the center, as expected. The meat always arrives very hot, as if it's straight off the grille (out, hot from the oven), which I really appreciate. Sides are typical of a high-end steak house: potatoes several ways, some green vegetables, all served with enough for 2-3 to share.  Table bread is very good; don't miss the brown raisin bread, it's excellent. Salads and deserts are also pretty standard fare for a good, old-school steak house. The wine list is vast. But the SERVICE is impeccable. Servers are professional but warm, and they know all the specials and all the menu items. There are others who keep the drinks filled frequently. So, yes, I highly recommend this Capital Grille location. One final tip:  just valet park. You won't find anything better."
"5.0","By far my favorite subway location! If you work at the university/hospital or ride a bus line on Atwood this location is super convenient‚Äã. Usually in my experience when subways are close to major places their customer service and quality of food tend‚Äã to suffer but I'm really happy about the sandwich and service I received‚Äã here today. The guy who made my sandwich was SUPER speedy (if there was a subway record for fastest sandwich-making‚Äã I'm sure he would win). The nice lady who checked me out was also really friendly and asked if I wanted a cup for water before I even asked. The veggie toppings were also very fresh and they're‚Äã pretty generous with how much they slap onto your sandwich. Keep being fresh, subway. Keep being fresh."
"5.0","All of their teas are delicious! Try the Yerba Redhead - it's the best! Plus local honey and tons of food options for lunch."
"4.0","I work in the USX tower, love having the old school for breakfast. Tacos are great in the summer, nachos are good too. The staff is very friendly and fun too."
"5.0","It's restaurant week and I am so glad I finally had an opportunity to dine here. Having made a reservation I was seated promptly in one of the side dining rooms near the bar. Although the place is upscale the daytime dress is usually business casual.For a $20.19 3 course meal they had a good selection to choose from. I decided to go with their tossed salad to start followed by their seared honey glazed salmon with green beans and almonds. For my dessert I chose the flourless espresso chocolate cake. Service was top notch and I was given both heated dinner rolls as well as a huge delicious wafer I could break off and enjoy my meal with. The restaurant is adorned with paintings of local notables such as Andrew Carnegie. I noticed that being centrally located in the city the Capital Grill is a great place to hold a business luncheon and as others have noted a good place for special occasions. Free WiFi is available. My salad was delicious and my salmon entree was served on a very hot plate. Although it appeared small it was fairly dense and cooked to perfection. I got the opportunity to meet the manager Nick who welcomed me and asked if I needed anything then to see him. Service was exceptional and they made sure I had plenty of drink as well as cleaning my table. Can't forget the piece de resistance-the flourless chocolate espresso cake with cream and a raspberry. Cake was small but oh so rich and yummy! Best known as one of the city's many steakhouses I was glad that they have other options to choose from. Located in Piatt Place on 5th Ave across from the Milkshake factory public transportation as well as nearby parking garages are available."

"5.0","I'm not one to throw around 5 stars all Willy-Nilly. I have quite literally nothing to complain about. Service was great and the food was incredible. Might be a tad pricey, but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for."
"3.0","I get that people love this place. It's hip and dark. The food was fresh and really good. The service wasn't great."
"4.0","A solid 4 stars. The burgers are delicious, the rosemary fries are great! It's surprising rosemary fries aren't served in more restaurants. The quality of the ingredients is apparent. The drink prices are surprisingly below market value. The location and large windows are perfect for a Lawrenceville eatery. The only drawback were slightly cloudy and water spotted water glasses."
"3.0","I must agree with Monique and say that for this review I wish we could give half stars- because this place would be a 3.5 for me. Alas, that's not how the game works, so I have to fall on the side of 3 rather than 4. The primary reason for the 3 star is simply because I've had better Thai food in Pittsburgh. Second, I (like others have said) have hardly tasted Thai food I haven't liked, so I control my Thai food bias by using the metric of comparison to other Thai joints. Nonetheless, this is a nice place to sit and enjoy some well made food in a place that has a bunch of character. I've eaten here many times with friends, and I definitely prefer this place over Thai Cuisine right down the street. These guys do a mean curry, and the staff have always been very friendly to me. I'd recommend that people stop in if they're in the area and looking for good Thai."
"4.0","We went there on our visit to Pittsburgh. We heard a lot of praises for this place and decided to visit. The food was good. We ordered beef Sichuan, sweet and sour chicken. They also give a chicken roll with the food which was out this world delicious. All the food comes with either plain white rice or fried rice."
"4.0","Great little place for a sandwich or homemade soup.  The chicken chili with cornbread was delicious, just like my mom's.  The cornbread was good, too.  Split an Eastender sandwich that was on freshly baked ciabatta bread.  Prices are so reasonable, just $6.95 for the sandwich.  Open for breakfast & lunch.  The menu has breakfast sandwiches, homemade soup, lunch sandwiches and some baked goods.  If your in the area be sure to stop by and grab a bit."
"5.0","Edgar came to my work the other day and it was totally great!  I had the lengua tacos and a beef empanada.  Not only was the food delicious, the salsa was awesome too.  I always like spicy stuff and the hot salsa delivered and had a punch of garlic too."
"4.0","We did all three floors at Sienna Mercato.  This one was my favorite.  We had the chef's choice charcuterie and wine, and my friends also had a pizza.  The charcuterie was just wonderful with many different flavor combos that would please any palate.  My friends enjoyed their pizza very much and said they would get it again. Service was underwhelming (on all three floors, actually). Atmosphere on this floor seemed to be slightly more upscale than the other two, though none of them were 'stuffy.'"
"5.0","#1 coffeeshop in Pittsburgh, go hungry !best crepes i had in a long time , definitely coming back"
"4.0","$8 flat rate for any pizza. It's definitely a good deal. They have some signature pizzas that you can choose from or you can choose to build your own. The concept is very similar to the many fast casual restaurants that are popping up (Chipotle, Qdoba, Subway, etc.) If you choose to build your own, you get unlimited toppings for the flat rate of $8. They have numerous sauce options that you can pick from for the base of your pizza, so it makes it easy to be adventurous with your creation. The meats, cheeses, and veggies are plentiful in choices as well. They do not have a shortage of toppings to choose from! They have something for everyone here! I have eaten here a few times and I have not been disappointed with the quality of food or service. I have had a chance to have a conversation with Tony, the owner, and he is genuinely a good guy who cares about all of his customers. It's a good place to pick up a quick meal, and I plan on returning for future visits."
"4.0","Here's my first time. Little wait time but food was tasty. Must and should try Lamb Biryani. I really loved the taste. We were three friends. I expect a little more customer service and a person to take care of customers. Usually place seems to be busy thoughThis is my Second time. I came here for buffet. I was but disappointed. I want to mention few little things which can improve your rating. Few items are cooked and were not refilled. Couple of Plates weren't cleaned properly, it was with food particles. I would suggest you please keep a extra staff who can refill things and food and Amongst all items only chicken , shrimp ( though served late after asking couple of times) and mutton Biryani were yummy rest They weren't tasty. Idli was refilled late and dosa was satisfying. Chutney for it not up-to the taste I expected. Desert no  good at all. I was expecting the Mango lassi. But that too was finished. Finally they don't have spoons and forks to eat. I end up eating the desert with my hand. When I asked for answer was negligent. I don't suggest that this place is good for buffet unless you go for the first hour. And don't go with high expectations. And if you want more items in buffet and no wait time for the table to serve. Better try All Indian restaurant. You will feel happy satisfied."
"4.0","It has to be at least 25 years since I ate at Pamela's. It was one of my mother's favorite places to grab a quick bite. We met a dear friend on Saturday midday for brunch/lunch, and I ask myself, why did I wait so long to go back, after a multitude of trips back to the 'Burgh' throughout the years? I had an omelet -- cooked to perfection. I am a picky omelet eater. My eggs have to be cooked just so . . . and so they were! Truly a rarity. The accompanying potatoes were heavenly. My husband loved his corned beef and hash with eggs and potatoes. The short stack of pancakes that our friend ordered was huge . . . and after one bite, I was in Seventh Heaven. Oh, how I wish I could make pancakes just like that! The thin pancakes, almost crepe-like, with their crispy outer edges are divine. This location begs for an aesthetic makeover . . . looks like the same furniture as 25 years ago, but what it lacks there, it makes up for in the yummy food. Service was quick but unremarkable. Next time we're back in town, we'll definitely stop by for breakfast -- early so we don't have to wait!"
"5.0","My sister took me here since I was visiting her for her graduation. She said this is her go-to Thai restaurant!Pros: This place is sooo good! I didn't expect much for Asian food in Pittsburgh, but this place really impressed me. We got the green curry chicken, red curry beef, basil chicken, basil fried rice, and pad kee mao. For the most part, everything was good! And cheap too! In my experience, Thai food is always about $11-15 per entree, and they don't give much. But Thai Gourmet's dishes are about $8-10, and they give you SO much!! I was really impressed. And this place is SPICY!! They ask you what spice level you want on a scale from 1-10, and we got 5 for most of our dishes. It is definitely spicy for a level 5! But my family loves spicy so it was a nice spicy. And the service was great because the waitresses were ON POINT with topping off our water! They're probably used to it since they're food is so spicy haha. I really liked the green curry chicken and the basil chicken. Cons: It's kinda in a sketchy area, but at least there is close-by parking. Overall: This place is great!! Cheap, big portions, and super tasty! I wish I had a Thai place like this where I live. Definitely check it out if you haven't!!"
"5.0","My friend and I were just strolling through the Strip District and landed ourselves in front of Cafe Raymond so we decided to give it a try.  I was surprised at how big the cafe felt.  We also went on a Saturday at 2:30 (right before closing!) and there was absolutely no wait.  We both had the Chicken Cheesesteak which came with a pickle and potatoes.  It was the perfect meal for shopping in the Strip District.  The waitress/cashier was really nice and answered a gazillion questions we had when ordering.  It was a great quiet place to eat and catch up with my friend."

"4.0","Beta Bites's falafel panini is awesome! It is nice and warm, and the flavors are unique and delicious. The fries are also seasoned really well and are slightly tangy, which I love. Beta bites also has some zucchini fries that are pretty good. The employees/owners are really nice. The only downside is that it can take a while to wait for your food, so it's best if you order ahead of time. Portion sizes are also a tad small (the falafel panini is a little bit small for the price in my opinion) but I love this place and will keep coming back! Definitely my favorite late-night grab and go food in Oakland."
"5.0","This is an awesome place to eat for seafood!! Food is tremendous!! Bartenders are great! Shuck the oysters at a station right in front of you (depending on where you are seated). All appetizers, drinks and entrees are great! Reserve early for weekends! Also, right in the Strip ... make a day/evening of it... go shopping at the wineries/shops or go bar hopping while you're parked there. Mexican, Asian, Greek, Italian markets and restaurants are all there."
"5.0","This place is amazing! The beer, food and the crew are fantastic! Highly recommend! Grace is the best server I've ever had the pleasure to be served by and Joe is the best chef ever! The Brassica was amazing. I was full 3/4 of the way through the dish but had to finish it because it was so tasty!"
"5.0","Everything on the menu is great. Everything. The bacon cheeseburger(made with beef bacon) might be the best in town. The falafel and schwarma are awesome, as is everything from the hot bar; chili chicken and palakpaneer are my favorites. The service is very polite and prompt, and some of the friendliest folks around. Next door is a fantastic market with a top notch halal butcher. Don't hesitate, go to Salems."
"4.0","My favorite Indian spot in Oakland! I always go for the buffet as it's a better deal and the regular menu is a little expensive. I'm never disappointed!"
"4.0","I love this rooftop bar! We decided to go here after Billy Joel, and I am only writing the review since we got food. As far as drinks go this place is a great place to go anytime of the year! (It has a retractable roof!!!!) The view and atmosphere are absolutely amazing, the only other comparable thing would be Biergarten at the Hotel Monaco. The reason for the four stars is because even though the service and flatbread pizza we got were great the late night snack menu was seriously lacking. Being from out of town, maybe I overestimate Pittsburgher's appetite for a decent late night appetizer menu. I understand cutting costs by only offering flatbread pizzas, but having the choice of bruschetta or nachos or anything other than pizza would have been nice. That being said, the bacon and egg pizza with maple glaze we got was a solid decision and tasted like breakfast morning. I will keep coming here with friends and family, but maybe just for drinks next time!!!"
"4.0","Another new spot that's sure to please. No flights yet so we made our own with two ounce pours. The pours are tasty and interesting. Definitely worth trying out. My fave is the coffee milk stout. Interior not too different than when it was Roasted but it feels lighter and more open. Really digging it here. Next time we come will include dinner."
"4.0","My husband and I recently went to Sausalido with our Groupon ($20 for $40). We had a nice dinner but wouldn't rush back. I had the peach-stuffed chicken, which was delicious, cooked to perfection, and plated nicely. It was a huge portion. I requested mushroom risotto that came with a different dish rather than the squash risotto that was supposed to come with my dish. It was excellent. My husband had the London Broil. It tasted good and also was a generous portion, but the plating/presentation was pretty bad. The biggest thumbs down is the decor. It's not very warm or especially comfortable, and there are a lot of tables in a small space. (In fact, it was through overhearing the woman at the adjacent table order that I had the idea to swap the risottos.) At times our service was great, with the waitress stopping by often to refill our water etc., and other times during the meal we were wondering where she was, especially when it was time to pay and we wanted to leave. The owner or manager stopped at our table before we left to ask about our experience.Overall, it is a nice restaurant with wonderful food, but there's nothing pulling me back right away."
"4.0","Went for a late lunch on New Years Eve. Expected a crowd, but the restaurant had a very light crowd.  Waiter was very attentive, food was absolutely outstanding. Soup, fries, burger, tenderloins and chicken were all done superbly, some creme br√ªl√©e for dessert was a great finish. Only issue was a phantom charge on our bill for somebody else's drink."
"3.0","Latest addition to the already booming Lawrenceville. The food is ok. Maggie's Farm burger is smoked Gouda horse radish caramelized onion roasted chiles and rum aioli is decent. Honestly I've had way better burgers elsewhere. Rosemary fries fell flat in flavor and came out cold.Decor is industrial and fresh with modern twists on soda fountain, etc. For being open less than a week I will give another shot. Service is friendly but the server we had was confused, unsure and our initial order came out wrong.***update***It's been a couple of weeks and I'm sad to say all I've written above still holds true. The food is just ok; nothing more."

"4.0","Sienna Mercato's Il Tetto is Open: Let's Shout It From the Rooftop!I am infatuated with delicious eats, but I'm a sucker for ambience.  Find me a place that has both, and I will be your number one customer.  I'm excited to say that the visionaries behind Sienna Mercato are now two for two with the recent opening of Il Tetto.  Now you have the mother of all dilemmas.  Will you get your meatball on at Emporio (located on the first floor) before or after you take the elevator ride to Il Tetto's gorgeous rooftop beer garden? As some of you know I've been anticipating the opening of Il Tetto for some time.  As the cosmos would have it, their second night in operation just happened to be my birthday.  No lie, I was a tad nervous bringing my band of friends to a locale I had never been before, but the idea of a spacious rooftop bar in downtown was just too darn tempting to pass up.  My imagination had nothing on this place.  Upon exiting the elevator, my jaw dropped a bit.  The rain had stayed at bay, allowing the retractable glass ceiling to reveal a portion of the city's skyline and a pleasant nighttime breeze.  Seating options varied from cozy nooks to sizable party tables.  The bar, which lined an entire stretch of wall, was inviting as well.  No matter where you sit, be sure to look up and admire the gas lamps and charming strings of lights.  The d√©cor is pleasing to most anyone I'd wager, from sports fans (there were several TVs playing the Buccos game) to those seeking a romantic rendezvous and anyone in between.  So, Il Tetto is picturesque, you get it.  But looks will only get you so far (as my grandma loved to remind me when I'd get 'gussied up.')  I needed to get my hands on a birthday libation.  Lucky for me, the draft list is equally as impressive as Emporio's.  The reason?  Each of the 32 drafts that are downstairs are piped up to Il Tetto's bar.  You can also imbibe on wine and specialty cocktails if you prefer. In regards to food, the menu provides a select list of small plates ranging from munchies like house-made Pork Rinds to heavier dishes like the Duck Confit Steak Fries.  We ordered the latter.  The fries were crisp, yet tender and the duck fat gravy added a velvety richness to the plentiful shreds of duck meat.  The topping of a sunny side-up egg added yet another level of richness and texture.  In other words, it was...To read my full review and check out delicious food pics, please visit: http://fork2mouth.blogspot.com/2014/05/sienna-mercatos-il-tetto-is-open-lets.html"
"4.0","Nice cafe with unique outside seating. I recommend if you're looking for a casual brunch spot in the area. One thing I wasn't a big fan of is how they served water from mini Costco‚Äã water bottles, but maybe it was a temporary‚Äã thing. I ordered the Mediterranean‚Äã omelet‚Äã and it was delicious. The outside seating area is fun, it has a bunch of rainbow umbrellas‚Äã hanging above to block the sun. ‚Äã"
"4.0","The fried chicken is alright, but there are other places with better fried chicken. The chicken seems like it is seasoned with ramen packet seasoning, which a lot of people like but I feel as if the chicken isn't as crunchy."
"2.0","I really wanted to like this place, but...16 taps: 1 sparkling ale, 1 dark ale, 1 sour, 3 IPAs, 1 cider, and....yep, 9 taps empty. Meh.And then the food: Pretentious descriptions that bordered on the unintelligible (how many Americans know what 'chicharrones' or 'raillettes' are?*), to which the plates themselves did not really live up. This place should spend more time producing beer and having their taps full, balance the 4 IPA/sour taps with some barrel aged beers or at least some more variety, and make the food more approachable.*I do, I am fluent in 4 languages, but c'mon, this is Lawrenceville."
"5.0","Excellent beer and service, the head chef joe makes some killer dishes the brassica was very different and really good if you're a vegetarian. the wait staff is extremely friendly Grace was exceptional with the recommendations I'm so glad we came in here!"

"1.0","Overpriced, overrated, and really just a frustrating and mediocre experience as a whole. For some strange reason, they don't allow substitutions of any kind. If you want to switch the cheese on a burger that you're ordering from the menu, even if the cheeses cost the same on the customized menu, they charge you a dollar extra. Want to trade out one veggie for another? That'll be a dollar too. They even charge 50 cents for putting ketchup on your burger, despite the fact that there are already ketchup bottles on the table! The burgers themselves are pretty mediocre, honestly no better than fast food burgers that you can get for a fifth of the price. And the service is unbearably slow, with orders taking ages even at off-peaks hours of the day. Given the fact that burger places are ubiquitous these days, I seriously recommend staying away from this place and finding somewhere better to eat."
"5.0","Salem's is my all time favorite halal  place in Pittsburgh. I have been coming here since I was seven and ever since they expanded and opened the grill, they have always provided me with quality food. An absolute must is the halal bacon cheeseburger and the chicken shawarma with the chipotle mayo sauce. The hot food bar is also good if the grill is closed and they have really great spinach and chicken options."
"3.0","CHiKN was on our radar since the opening and we were so excited to try. Now that we have, I am not sure if we will return. Parking in Oakland can be a challenge but luckily this restaurant is just two blocks away from a parking garage on Meyran 'Forbes/Semple Garage'.  I heard the 'hot' was unbearable, so I ordered a 'medium' chicken sandwich and was told by the gentleman that rang up my order that their medium was really hot too.   I still went for it - because I love hot n spicy food.  Within the first bite - I can feel that my lips will be numb after eating the sandwich lol ..   it was a great-n hearty sandwich. WARNING:  'medium' is very hot.  I loved the coleslaw on the sandwich. I am a fan of crinkle cut fries and when they arrived looked appetizing but were so bland! I had to dress them up with a lil pepper n ketchup.  The mac n cheese we liked.  My boyfriend got the mild sandwich and loved it.  Cards only NO cash. *PROS:  *Small Menu: I like the fact that the menu is small - you know everything is fresh (well at least you hope).  *Spacious seating*Good service - with ordering and the food came fast. *CONS:  Extremely loud music:  We could have done without the loud rap music that was playing.   I like rap like most but the volume was a bit extreme and we couldn't wait to get out of there to have a conversation.  *Expensive for a chicken sandwich*No sides of bbq sauce offered?!"
"3.0","Okay, for every negative there is a positive with this place. And I put the 'positive' part after 'negative' because it's really not BAD at all. In any sense of the word. I'm always a fan of BYOB places...so there's that.The place is small but the service is very quick and eager (perhaps too much...she checked on us way too much and there was a definite feeling of her trying really hard to come across as super friendly and nice. It kind of felt like she was part of our conversations). It has a friendly atmosphere and a comfortable vibe to it.My boyfriend got the pork chops which I'm never a fan of but it was well prepared and the cabbage/mashed potato bed it was on was delicious. Reminded me of a German eisbein.I got the beet and bleu cheese salad and it was delicious.  Wayyyyyyy too many beets but I love a little beet dish by itself so I'm really not complaining. Really, it's a great salad. I also got the mussel appetizer and they were the biggest mussels I've ever seen. The only negative is that they were extremely gritty and I felt way too many times like I was crunching on sand and I couldn't finish as it was turning my stomach.Side note: they have an interesting dip for their bread...a white bean puree in balsamic vinegar and oil. It would have been better had they 86ed the white bean puree. Just really an addition without adding anything."
"3.0","I went to Cafe Raymond for the first time the other day.It is in the strip district and parking can be a challenge.I see a ton of 5 star reviews and I have to say for me at least I was a bit surprised.My first impression walking in was Cafe Raymond was a nice looking place and staff seemed very nice.Then I found out you had to go to register first and order then sit down and wait for food.This is not your typical diner were you sit and a waiter or waitress takes your order.Once you order at the counter they give you a number stand to put at table so they know were to serve food.To be honest when it comes to breakfast I am not that adventurous, I order the same thing all the time.I had 2 eggs over easy and bacon and home fires and white toast.The coffee is served at the table but if you need milk or sugar you have to get up and go to the area that has that.The coffee was a bit bitter for my taste I really did not like it at all.The meal itself was ok, The eggs were cooked fine and tasted fine.The bacon was ok nothing special.The wait staff and cashier were very friendly and very helpful.The service was excellent overall.Unfortuanlty I do not think I would not go back again unless my wife wanted to.I like sitting down and someone taking my order and then being served.I do not like waiting at the cashier to order first then sitting down and then having to get up to do your coffee.Cafe Raymond was not for me at all.overall the service was excellent, The place was clean and well run.MY only big complaint is the waiting at the register to order & the coffee was terrible.I would of given Cafe Raymond 2 stars , But the food and service was good overall so ill give them 3 stars."
"2.0","While the food is good,the service is bad.We arrived as a group and waited for almost 15 minutes with no response and walked away.If you are hungry and need quick food bite this is not the location.This is not the second or third experience we had in the past one month."
"5.0","First time at Arnold's today and it is a great addition to East Ohio St. They clearly know their teas and what I really liked was when the tea-rista brought the tea over to me -- which was a nice gesture itself -- she let me know how much longer to keep the tea bag in the mug. I usually have no idea how long the bag has been in when I order tea. For those who are not into hot tea, they have a wide selection of iced teas, as well as coffee too. They did a really nice job on renovating the space, giving a fairly large space a warm and inviting ambiance."
"4.0","Excellent, fresh fish.  Nothing terribly interesting about the rolls, but the did the standard stuff (and the Steelers Roll?) very well.  And the waiter was helpfully able to tell our group about what fish was the most fresh.Location not ideal, tucked away in an empty mall.  But, that doesn't really impact the food, does it?"
"1.0","We went to Luke Wholey's for the first time as we were eager to try something new. We had an 8pm reservation and were not seated until 8:30. There were plenty of open tables and plenty of upset guests waiting for their table who also had reservations. The restaurant was so backed up they were turning away anyone without a reservation. We finally sat down and didn't see a waiter for about 20minutes when we were finally able to order cocktails and an appetizer. After about 15 more minutes we finally got our drinks but no appetizer. 45minutes later the appetizer finally arrived. We got the lobster bisque fries which did arrive hot (I was worried with how the evening was going they'd be stone cold) and were delicious. After waiting an additional 45minutes our dinner finally arrived. I was already slightly annoyed by the length we'd waited and how long it took to get even the simplest thing like a fork. I ordered the Baja shrimp volcano. When I ordered it the waiter even commented that it was a fan favorite. The dish consists of mashed potatoes, shrimp, asparagus and a lobster claw. The dish was pretty good with the expectation of the lobster 'claw'. What I received was a small chunk of lobster used in a lobster roll or lobster bisque, not a claw. It was hidden in the mashed potatoes and I had to dig to find it. this restaurant up charges customers for the lobster in this dish and thinks the lobster they served can pass as a claw (photo attached). I saw another customers bowl of lobster bisque and commented that that dish had more lobster in it than my own. Overall the food was okay but I would seriously think twice about returning. We have been one other time when we just stopped by for drinks at the bar. The bartender informed us the kitchen was closed for 45 minutes and no one could order because they were so backed up. Seems this is an ongoing problem for this restaurant  and they are unable to keep up with the demand."
"1.0","This place stinks! Literally. It smells like the janitors closet at the YMCA in Swissvale. If the smell doesn't turn you away the minute you walk in the door Rosie O'Donnel's twin sister Bertha the no clue what it means to be a server at a restaurant that fancies itself to be a 'fine dining' establishment waitress will.  I get tired of telling hippie chefs that grew up 'dining' at Eatin' Park, went through the culinary arts program at Allegany Community  College and now think that this justifies them charging $29 for a bowl of Orrichetti, how to run their restaurants but here I go again. Dude (it is dude isn't it?) cooking isn't brain surgery. Ninety percent of your customers can cook at home just as well as you can. People don't go out to dinner for the food. They go to be pampered, to feel special, to feel welcome and to have their ass kissed. I spend all day kissing my customers asses so when I go out to cut loose with some hard earned coin it's time for someone to reciprocate. Pucker up baby daddy's home. I see a food truck in your future."
"5.0","An update from 1 year ago. The 5 stars is for the sushi.  I have not had anything cooked so I can't review that.  Yes the atmosphere is lacking but the sushi is the bomb.  If you are looking for crazy rolls and sushi mixed with this and that go somewhere else.  If you are looking for authentic top quality sashimi or sushi go here.  I had bonito, king mackerel, toro, red snapper... All were served with just the slightest embellishment, the fish speaks for itself.  Even the soy sauce is homemade!Some of the best sushi I have ever had at very reasonable prices."
"4.0","Always a fan of Alexander's.   The food is great at a reasonable price and the service is good."
"5.0","Really cool breakfast and lunch spot. I noticed a bunch of people ordering the authentic Turkish coffee so I can't wait to try that next time I visit. I ordered a sweet crepe and a chai latte which were both wonderful. They have limited outdoor seating but it's worth it to wait to sit on their balcony. The price is very fair and the staff is friendly."
"3.0","Have been here twice, and the second time felt rather unappreciated as a customer. The food is alright, but I felt like the customer service was lacking. We were trying to go on a nice early breakfast date as a 2-person party and got seated next to another person at a 4-top table. We raised our concerns with the host, but she just walked off.Sure, the place is busy, but did you have to seat us shoulder-to-shoulder with somebody on one side, and employees brushing past us with food on the other? We were practically in the kitchen area and kept getting bumped into or brushed up against, all while being shoulder to shoulder with another party (they bussed the table and put another 2-person party at our table after the first person left).We made it clear to the server that we wanted to move to another table, but she seemed to shrug it off with stuff like 'oh, yeah, this is an old school diner, the tables are bolted down!' I said 'well, I think that we are going to be leaving, if we don't get re-seated somewhere else.' After it was clear that we were going to be sitting with strangers while being bumped into or brushed on by employees, we just got up and left to get breakfast somewhere else where we could have some space.While we were on our way out, we were walking past about a dozen other 2-person parties who had their own 4-top tables that they weren't sharing with another party and not getting in the way of employees going back and forth from the kitchen.I wish that either the host or server took our concerns more seriously, and moved us to another table. We would have stayed if it wasn't for the complete disregard for our preferences. I don't think that we were asking for too much, especially since many other 2-person parties were able to sit at their own tables, away from the kitchen area.The previous time I was here, we did enjoy the food, but found the cash-only policy to be an inconvenience, as well as the general hustle and bustle going on all around us. It was fine though, and I'd rate my first visit a 4-star experience."
"5.0","The is a great little place. The staff is friendly. The food is always fresh. The chili is awesome. There is a wide variety of sandwiches, salads, a soup of the day and two types of chili.

"2.0","It pains me to give such a low review for a pizza shop with such amazing pizza. The reason is simple, they keep raising prices. The final straw was when a large pepperoni pizza and fries came to over $20. Ad in a tip and it's almost $30. I have heard my neighbors complain about this as well. I'm sorry to say that I will not be ordering or eating food from Rialto's until their pricing comes back to reality. It's price gouging plain and simple."
"1.0","Warning: Be sure to demand an ironclad written contract for any catering provided by this establishment, a mistake we made in not securing at the beginning.  The dishonesty of the proprietor has soured our taste for visiting Caff√© Mona again.Several months ago we enjoyed a wonderful Sunday brunch at Caff√© Mona in the Lawrenceville section of Pittsburgh.  We had excellent crepes and coffees, and on the way out inquired about the availability of the establishment for a bridal shower in June.  One of the owners showed us an inviting outdoor deck area and suggested that we could use the outdoor space, order off the menu and bring in our own alcoholic beverages for no extra charge.  Given that the most expensive crepe on the menu was $13, we assumed a $20 budget per person was adequate, especially because we were providing the tablecloths, alcohol, and dessert.  We reviewed the menu, set a date and time with the proprietor and headed home to Connecticut.  We felt we had discovered a wonderful place for the special event.Then everything changed.  Two weeks before the event we confirmed our arrangement and agreed to visit the venue two days beforehand to make final arrangements and to provide a requested deposit.  Upon entering the establishment, I was informed by the other owner Eto that instead of ordering and paying off the menu, I would be required to pay a set fee of $40 per person in cash, even though the restaurant accepted credit cards for breakfast and lunch all the time.  Insisting that such a fee was never the agreement, Eto argued with me, stating that the fee included a room charge and a corking fee per person.  In the end he agreed to $30 per person, even though even that arrangement was excessive.  I requested a receipt and written invoice for the full charge; the owner scratched out an unprofessional handwritten '$140 deposit taken, owe $250, Eto M' on a piece of  scrap paper.  Given that it was only 48 hours before the shower, however, I felt I had no choice but to swallow the demand.After the event that included crepes off the menu that ran from $8 to $13, a plate of cut fruit, and non-alcoholic beverages for 13 people, I prepared to pay the remainder of the $390 charge.  Eto again demanded cash payment only and then stated that he expected a $90 tip for the two owners and the waitress.  I refused to pay the tip for an already over-charged event, and he nastily told me to eat at McDonald's next time. We won't return to Caffe Mona for even a cup of coffee."
"5.0","fantastic food and cute host, the spider roll is yummy,  and especially the corstini bread in the mussel dish is the best corstini I've ever had. Crab cake is so good as well, and i love their oyster combined with different two types which are fresh and worth to try."

Our waitress was kinda rough not amazing service but overall good place."
"1.0","Sad to report that this was a total bust. We used the no wait app as suggested by their website. We got there a little early, checked in, and went to the bar to order a drink. We asked for a drink menu and after deciding what we wanted stood there for about 10 minutes without speaking to a bartender (and they were no that busy). Deciding that we didn't really want drinks in a small plastic cup decided to wait and order from our table. Stood there a bit, tables were available, and others were being seated. The hostess forgot about us. We were finally seated and sat at our table for 15 minutes, never spoke to a server, no water, nothing. We walked out.  Disappointed."
"4.0","Small and easy to miss place in the heart of Little Italy. BYOB with a reasonable $2 corkage fee per person resulting in an inexpensive evening.Entrees are in the $20-$26 range an include a salad and a wonderful white bean/balsamic/rosemary dip with bread cubes. Actually, I think all of us would have been content to forgo entrees and have a glass of wine and enjoy the bread and white bean dip, which appears to include unlimited refills.That said, the entrees are varied including trout, duck, porkchop, risotto, crab cakes. Many dishes included brussell sprouts, which two at our table aren't enamored with and were easily substituted for other accompaniments.The person at our table with the gluten allergy found the waiter able to offer many choices to meet her needs. Definitely food-allergy friendly.Service is fine. A bit noisy until the owner turned down the Lionel Richie music upon request.  Portion sizes were reasonable and everyone enjoyed their meals.Not five stars, but a solid four star entry in Bloomfield.As an aside, we miss D'Amico's."
"4.0","Very good. I went with coworkers the day before thanksgiving. It was a Wednesday which is wing day - $12.99 for unlimited and they didn't skimp. It was no wait and food came out fast for a group of 8. One coworkers was a vegetarian and they were able to accommodate.It was fairly quiet inside during lunch. Could've been that many people took off from work that day. That made it easy to hear and quicker service. I enjoyed a bacon turkey wrap with fries. The portion of fries was on the smaller side but still seasoned well and tasted good. Overall very good- basically what I'd expect from a burger place with god service and i had no complaints at all."
"5.0","Another amazing dinner experience with my husband. I don't think the food could get any better. Drinks are great too!Do the YUM YUM sushiCrab stuffed salmonAnd key lime pie..and you will leave happy!"
"4.0","Kiku is a great and quaint restaurant. The service is good and the environment is very relaxing. The food took longer than I expected. The quality of the sushi was excellent. The Sake sampler was something new and nice."
"5.0","Had breakfast on Labor Day. Egg/cheese on a croissant with potatoes. Excellent dish. 2nd floor seating offered a nice view of Penn."
"5.0","Amazing place so underrated. The settings outside couldn't be better, and the inside was amazing with all of the different paintings on the wall. The service was great and the food was pretty good for brunch."
"2.0","I had a table for four last evening. We were thanking someone for help that they provided us all year long. I made a reservation about three weeks in advance. I typically thoroughly enjoy dining here. On this evening, not at all. We were seating in the lounge right next to the doorway. The foyer area was packed which allowed the bar and lounge to back up with unsafe crowding. The table was not a normal sized table for four. The waitress had to yell when speaking to us. There was little opportunity to have conversation with the noise level. I had countless ass in my face from people standing near the table. Constantly be bumped as well. At 6:30 pm they were out of shellfish platters and augratin potatoes. How can that happen? I can't afford to come here but once or twice a year. After spending about $440 with tip all I got was 'it's really crazy tonight. Come back another time, I'm sure it will better.' Guess what it will probably be a long time. Again the food was good. But I come here for the full experience - no excuse was going to be acceptable. There are other overpriced steakhouses. Very disappointed!"
"5.0","Pamela's: Naturally a Pittsburgh staple.Pamela's is as Pittsburgh as things get.  A fast, easy dining experience, kind caring staff, and Lyonnaise potatoes.What exactly is the correlation between Lyonnaise potatoes and Pittsburgh?  I don't really know, but the correlation between those potatoes and my tastebuds are pure deliciousness.What's really cool about Pamela's is that each one has its one personal touch and decor, so it's pretty fun checking out a new one when I go.I know that I can trust Pamela's for some reliable, consistent and quick basics.Gail's favorite eggs are my current go to.  Somehow the eggs are perfectly moist, the cream cheese a nice touch, complemented by those Lyonnaise potatoes."
"4.0","The idea of people going to restaurants and ordering things that aren't on the menu only to slag them ruthlessly for not having those items is one that has always confused me. I assume these cranks want to dislike particular businesses and have churlish fun doing so. Sammy's is nothing more than what it is, and I'm not sure why some diners can't appreciate it for that. If one wants the Big Apple delicatessen experience, one should board a Greyhound, and coincidentally, a bus station is blocks away from this Sammy's satellite. So go. Far. Away. Please. At Sammy's, you'll find adequate service, a mixed, civil, quiet clientele, old-fashioned tavern decor, and fine, fine sandwiches served in normal proportions. Are they really 'Famous?' I don't know, don't care, and hear no one 'raving' about Sammy's aside from its haughty, eternally malcontented detractors. Sammy's makes sandwiches and serves alcohol, soft drinks, and a few other things. Cope with that. Regardless, I still feel that Sammy's makes a fabulously fatty yet fragile and flavorsome corned beef, but they do offer other kinds of sandwiches as well, and for some reason I was feeling like having tuna salad en route to a Symphony X concert at Altar Bar one evening last week, so that was what I treated myself to. See, I often crave that chilly, mushy, rich, creamy, slightly crunchy tuna filling between slices of sturdy white bread from time to time, and Sammy's delivered it unto me without fail, building the beast to my specifications (white bread, lettuce, tomato, onion, American cheese, and mayo). And I'd never ordered such a thing from Sammy's before, either. So take a chance for you I did, the Yelp lurker, coming out happily unscathed.What I have ordered before is their luscious potato salad, and I ordered it again due to its abundance of waxy, yielding spud cubes, tenaciously velvety dressing, and whatever other good, good things comprise it.  A fat, cold obelisk of dill pickle completed my basket nicely and kept me going for the rest of the long, strident night ahead, so to me, the portion was adequate and destroyed Subway with a bolt of lightning. Including a tall cup of Pepsi, my bill came to less than 7 dollars. I left a dollar tip and was thanked by my server who told me to 'holler' if I needed anything else.P.S. Over two years ago, I reviewed the corned beef sandwich itself at Sammy's sadly defunct Lawrenceville location...http://www.yelp.com/biz/sammys-famous-corned-beef-pittsburgh-2"
"5.0","A neighborhood gem. Arrived without a reservation on a Saturday night and no tables were available, so we were offered seats at the bar. Very good classic Italian-American food served in huge portions. It's a casual place, with patrons next to us enthusiastically watching football. Alexander is clearly a hands-on owner; we noticed him staying on top of the staff throughout the night, and kindly helping someone who seemed to be an elderly regular patron navigate their way out the front door after their meal. Alexander chatted with us after we ate, asking if everything was satisfactory. When we asked if desserts were made on site (specifically, were the canolis pre-filled, which they are not), he offered us two, on the house! I'll return next time I'm in Pittsburgh."
"3.0","I went during Restaurant Week since it was a perfect opportunity to try some Indian food in the area. I got a to-go box from the lunch buffet. The selection isn't large, but it's good--there's a small salad bar, galub jamun, naan, rice, and about six entree-style options. The food is good.However, the person at the register seemed annoyed at me when I asked about their Restaurant Week special and when I paid. He left before I handed him the signed receipt and told me to leave it on the counter, which I didn't feel very comfortable doing. The second time I went, I was charged full price until I asked about the Restaurant Week special. I guess this is understandable, but I didn't feel comfortable paying for my food. However, this place is the closest Indian restaurant to where I live, so I'll probably be back when I'm craving some."
"5.0","Great service and really cool area for brunch. The French toast was awesome and the chorizo hash was even better. Pittsburgh never disappoints man. Never."
"1.0","**I reviewed this restaurant on their other page with the ordering option embedded in the webpage (http://www.yelp.com/biz/chinatown-inn-pittsburgh-2?ob=1), but wanted to share it here as well.I placed an online order for delivery for lunch and I won't be doing it again. I ordered a vegetable egg roll and the eggplant in garlic brown sauce and requested that the spice level be medium. The egg roll was just okay - the duck sace that was provided came in small compote cups instead of the typical packets, it was also slightly brown and was bland. The eggplant dish was also unbelieveably bland. I've never experienced bland Chinese food, and all it did was highlight how greasy the food was. Since there was no taste, it became all about texture."
"2.0","Very poor service tonight, over 1 hour to get our food which was cold.No bread, ice cold vegetable.Kitchen seemed to be backed up or understaffed. Waitress was nice.No apology from the manager.I would think they would offer a dessert for the problems, but no.   This place was so good when it first opened in the new building, but has gone downhill. It's sad, they don't seem to listen to customers.  The newest menus are physically a joke, cheaply made.They discontinued some of their best items ( snow top buns, crumb buns, Pittsburgh sandwich etc).The cream pies have an artificial whipped cream topping that's pretty disgusting, very greasy.The chicken noodle soup is still great.It's a shame that one of our only 24 hour places to eat is lacking in customer service."
"5.0","These burgers are juicy and flavorful! I got the burger with the pepper on it and it was spicy but perfectly cooked. It came with hand cut fries that were great. I also got the perogie appetizer which I would recommend! The nice china plates were a great touch also."
"3.0","One of the popular steakhouses downtown. If you're looking to have a special night out and splurging a little, this is the spot. Service quality is great but expect long wait times during the popular lunch and dinner hours.Although I've heard great things, as a vegetarian diner, I was not overly impressed. They offer two off-menu vegetarian dishes: pasta with tofu/veggies or a rice dish with tofu/veggies. You get to select the vegetables and how your tofu is prepared. It was disappointingly bland and dry. The rice must've been sitting out for a while because it was crunchy by the time I got it. I had to ask for a sauce to drench over the tofu to add some flavor. It was like biting into styrofoam. The truffle fries saved the meal because they were delicious. Although they didn't have a house aioli, our server whipped up one last minute and it needed up tasting fantastic. We ended with ice cream for dessert that our server loaded up with berries, chocolate syrup and whipped cream - plus it was on the house for their Valentines' Day special. Everything tastes better if it's free."
"4.0","I'm not sure I have ever met a Thai dish I didn't like so perhaps I'm not the most unbiased reviewer here, but Thai Gourmet is one of those places that makes me salivate just thinking about it.This small little joint gives a hole-in-the-wall impression from the outside, but inside everything feels very crisp and clean.  There is a little bit of an art explosion on the walls, but I consider it a plus to get to muse about the various scenes, random portraits, etc. while enjoying my meal.  Everything I have ordered from here has always been fresh and a HUGE plus in my book is that they are incredibly consistent with their spiciness levels.  I can handle heat but nothing too extreme and I usually order a '6' here, but my boyfriend sometimes convinces me to kick it up a notch to a '7'.  Neither is overwhelming, but I can almost never finish my entire meal and have learned that the heat grows as the food sits and a '7' makes for some mouth-numbing leftovers.My current favorite dish on their menu is the baby bok choy in garlic sauce with shrimp, but I really think you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  This particular dish is cooked to perfection... the bok choy leaves wilt just the right amount and soak up the sauce while the stem stays a bit 'al dente' to create texture.  It is served with a healthy portion of shrimp and if memory serves me correctly fits the bill at around $10.  To be honest I have never paid attention to the price because 1) whatever they charged I would be willing to pay for it and 2) I'm always amazed at how little the total cost is when I have a full second portion to take home with me.If you order takeout, they also include a delectable little brownie to go with each entree.  My ONLY gripe with them is that they sometimes go on extended vacations (like right now, for example... tried to go there last week and saw that they are closed until the end of August).  I know, everyone deserves a vacation.  But maybe they could give me some warning so I can order up a full freezer's worth of food before they go???"
"1.0","I just got the Lemon Chicken Orzo soup and it was really awful. There was barely anything in it and the broth tasted like water. The one piece of chicken I got in it was so gross looking I had to take it out and throw away (it was attached to a string of purple weirdness and fat) so disappointed."
"5.0","I almost don't want to keep this to myself, but...La Gourmandine is downtown! Read that with a Kermit flailing arms voice, because I am *that* excited about it.  I do like a certain other regional chain bakery with the French name just fine too, but nothing beats the realer deal, La Gourmandine. It's located just across from the PNC Tower and is stacked with all my delicious familiar favorites that I usually get in the Lawrenceville location, but with the key difference that it's spacious and has seating for dining in. Which I haven't done yet, but will strongly consider for lunch in the future.  For now, I use La Gourmandine as motivation to get out of bed on cold mornings and come downtown instead of working from home in my pjs, haha.  I used to get my once-in-awhile-treat of almond croissants from the Gaby & Jules counter in Market Street Grocery, but even though they are closer to my office, I will be getting them from here because the former can't be bothered to deliver their baked goodies downtown before 8:30 am. The staff is very friendly and fast and is great about explaining what each pastry is, and is quick to tell you what to get in the morning before it sells out for the day."
"3.0","I stopped in on Saturday for their Ros√© event which had been heavily advertised on Facebook. I'd never been to Il Tetto before, and I have to say, based on this experience I doubt I'll be back anytime soon. Maybe I'll give it a year or two. It really left a bad taste.First and foremost, I understand the challenges of the space. To get to Ill Tetto, you have to take an elevator. Before which there is a very long line to wait in. Thankfully, they had a server there to take charge you out the wazoo by 'offering' you an alcoholic beverage.When you do finally get up to the rooftop, there's a huge wall of people. As far as your eye can see, people everywhere. The bar is 2-3ppl deep. All the tables are taken. There are groups of people hanging around a table that had raffle baskets on it.So everyone rushes out of the elevator and go in search of more beverages, and maybe a place to sit. It's important to mention here that usually Il Tetto is open seating, first come first served. I know this by looking at past reviews all over the internet. Thus when the crowd from my elevator rushes out to find seats, I follow suit.Well eventually I find a table, and join 3 other ladies already sitting there. Thankfully they agreed to let me join them. I was planning on being in for one and done, but judging by this crowd, it was going to take an extremely long time to get anything delivered to the table.A server approached and took my drink order (a froz√© ros√© or something similar sounding; basically a frozen ros√© wine cocktail) along with a debit card to close me out. Right after that is when a manager (assumed based on the suit and earpiece) who asked all of us if anyone had sat us there. The girls said no, and he proceeded to tell us that we couldn't sit there without being sat by the hostess. We also overheard his talking to our server who exclaimed 'that's on you' (I'm assuming about the table controversy)Well that's terrific. Because none of us had seen one; much less a hostess stand or a sign directing us to wait, or heck, even a reserved sign for the table. The manager proceeded to kick us off the table, and only started to apologize when I exclaimed that this was the worst run event I've seen in a a long long time. He called me 'honey' a couple of times and I was quick to correct him and make sure that didn't happen again.He apologized for the confusion, and promised a couple of things. Firstly, that he would find us a table ASAP. Secondly, that he'd comp our round of drinks. Then it changed to send out some appetizers. And finally that he'd send out a round of shots.Eventually we got moved to a table; but not before being forced to wait against a wall, while my dining companions desserts came out and they had no where to eat them, and while this group of girls who were standing near us sat at the table and proceeded to clink their glasses and boast how they eventually got a table and were ecstatic they had to kick someone else off of one to get it.When we did get to a table, there was further confusion on which server we would have. Let me repeat that. It was apparent that for a space filled with atLEAST 100-150 people that at the tables, there were 2-3 servers max. That's insanely vastly understaffed. We did also see a hostess, eventually. She stood behind the table that held the gift baskets, which was apparently a host stand. Still, there was no communication with anyone coming off the ekevators during the time we were there and more mad dashes for tables. Finally, there were 2 bartenders for a bar that spanned the length of the rooftop, and was 3 people deep at times down the entire length. Also incredibly understaffed.The manager did make good on a few of the many promises. He comped our first round of drinks. Or rather my first, and my dining companions second round. He also brought out a round of fireball shots. In the meantime, it took about 45 minutes to be told they were out of the frozen ros√© drink; and I'd need to order something else. I did so; which then took about another 15 minutes to obtain it.All said and done, it was getting late. I had already been there for two hours and had only been served one drink during that time frame. That's just ridiculous and uncalled for.So why 3 stars? I feel like an effort to recover was made, and that deserves at least a decent well thought out review and stars that are contemplated. The manager did everything he could do make us happy, and that's sincerely appreciated. He did forget about the appetizers, but again, they were so short staffed, I'm not surprised.So will I return? Maybe. If a friend wants to go, I'll be suggesting someplace else. If I'm left with no choice, I guess I'll resign myself and dip out early. That's the only way I'll be able to stand it if usual service is like the above."
"5.0","Everything about this place is awesome! I just wish it was closer to me. They have a great happy hour with $4 craft beers, $6 cocktails and specials on a lot of their food. Their food is amazing. Especially loved the mac and cheese, brussels and cauliflower and cheese plate to name a few. The service is always top notch too which I really appreciate. The space is romantic and intimate but is small and can get pretty busy late night. Parking can be challenging too but that's really with anywhere on Mt. Wash. Overall a solid place to grab some good drinks and even better food!"
"3.0","This place is full of potential. If they had enough people working here, I would give them five stars. But every time I have been here, I have waited a very long time to get my drink and/or food. This last time when we visited, they had run out of the buffalo chicken salad we wanted so we opted for the pear arugula salad. After we sat down, the cook cane over to apologize that they had run out of arugula so we opted for spring mix, a few minutes went by and they told us they were out of the pear   We fully enjoyed the two hot teas we ordered but I'm afraid we left without eating lunch. We hope they can solve the staffing problems. Everyone was very nice."
"3.0","Nothing spectacular, service was slow. Many tables that came in after us received their food and finished before we even got ours. Food was good, prices were decent, just wish the service was better. Might go back but there a many choices to choose from in the area."
"5.0","It's 6 months later and I decided to give CHiKN another shot. I went shortly before the lunch rush again. No wait. The cashier was very prompt, attentive, and very nice. The place was very clean and the music wasn't as loud as I remembered which would be a plus to some people I guess.My food was up by the time I could grab a plastic bag and napkins which was insane! There did happen to be a grill person on his phone but he didn't have gloves on and it was pretty slow at the moment. As long as he didn't stick his gloved hands in his pocket then handle food, I was good.It's about a 15 min walk back to my desk and everything maintained temp. Food was delicious and service was much better!"
"4.0","SOOOO GOOD!I went to try Burgh'ers on a groupon because I was interested in the locally sourced meats and produce. I am generally a 5 guys fan but not really into places like Burgatory. I found this place to be an awesome in between place. The d√©cor is bright modern and industrial. Very bright and clean. I was greeted warmly at the door and directed to the bar. My order was for takeout and as I waited I was able to take advantage of the $4.00 Faber drinks special. The bartender was very pleasant and very knowledgeable about the drinks and the menu. never having had Faber spirits before he was able to answer my questions about the brand.I ordered the Fox Chapel and the Maggie's farm burgers on potato bun with added bacon with the standard fries and salad. These burgers were good, very good. I tried them both with #theblend patties which are half beef and half mushroom. The burgers were better than any I've had. Tender and perfectly cooked. The reason that I gave them 4 stars is because even though I paid for bacon and ordered these on potato buns they came out bacon less on brioche. That being said, and I don't think I have ever said this before, I didn't miss the bacon. The burger was so good I didn't even notice the bacon was missing until halfway through. The brioche bun was soft and sweet and perfectly complemented the flavors of the burger. So even though they didn't get it right they got it right. This is not a cheap burger joint so expect 10 -15 per burger depending on add ons but it is worth it. They have chicken and blt's that I didn't try but turned my head when they came out of the kitchen. They even have the option of wild game meats and fried pierogies. Groupon is running a few different deals for this place and you should get one. I just bought 2 more and am going back tomorrow. Hope to see you there."
"3.0","The food was good.  But the one staff personnel was so very unpleasant  and NOT friendly at all.  Asked what kind of bread and we asked for the baked fresh bread that was on the menu and she told us we don't have fresh baked bread.  Asked for soup and her replied that it's not ready, no explanation as to when.  She was just so short and snotty with her answers, did not make the dining experience very good.  Thank goodness the rest of the staff was very nice included the gentleman that put the sandwich together, the young lady that got the drinks, the bartender and the gentleman that ran the cash register.  Just takes one rude staff person to to ruin the experience!"
"5.0","Great little diner! I used to work near Gabriella's and always enjoyed the special treat of the Greek breakfast sandwich. Gyro meat, egg, feta - all in a delicious pita. So good!I stopped back in (for the first time in a long time) and learned that while the ownership has changed the sandwich hasn't! Pete was so friendly and made a great sandwich, fries, and breakfast platter for us. There always coffee, hot and iced tea, and there is a cooler with beverages as well. The shop is tiny, but has seating for over 10 between the counter and two bar areas.The menu has so many options - breakfast and lunch. The location sits between Station Square and the Southside - but it's worth it to plan to stop in for a great meal!"
"1.0","I would have loved to have eaten here but the only item the worker would let us order was a personal dish pizza. This was not an issue, but after paying and waiting for the pizza the employee gave my meal away to someone else. When I questioned this, she simply told me she already served me my food. Absolutely terrible way of doing business. I will not be back."

"5.0","What an awesome place! Fascinating artwork. Hip, trendy, friendly, professional... Oh, and did I mention delicious food & drink?!? Fresh, perfectly cooked & seasoned seafood. Tantalizing, spot on cocktails-- watermelon/mint mimosa & best Bloody Mary in town!"
"5.0","I love this place. I come here multiple times a week, but what prompted me to write this review was something that stands out as amazing customer service. The last time I visited Doce there was an issue with my boyfriends order. We called the restaurant and not only did they immediately rectify the situation (refunded our rather large order) but the next time I came in they gave me a generous gift card for future visits. The employees and management really went way above and beyond to make up for the incident in a way not many restaurants still do. That is why I love this place ..great food from people who appreciate their customers..I'll be back ..probably tomorrow ..oh yeah they have amazing tacos too"
"3.0","So apparently this is the best breakfast in Pittsburgh? Alright! Well, it isn't bad. Three stars seems a little low but four feels too high. I got Gail's favorite eggs (scrambled eggs with cream cheese and scallions) and they were pretty good. I was hoping the cream cheese and scallions would be blended in, alas, they were just on top. Still a good combo, though. Their famous potatoes really are amazing, definitely the highlight of the meal! My friend got the corned beef hash and it was UBER SALTY. Like, super ridiculously salty. I know hash usually tends to have a lot of salt but this was outta control. I like that they have rye toast. I don't like that they have Pepsi products and super rude employees. Ya win some, ya lose some, I guess."
"5.0","I highly recommend Mezzo!  The entire wait staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and timely.  I had Le Genovese - there aren't enough positive adjectives to describe this dish.  Savory, flavorful, tender... I could go on & on.  Bravo, Mezzo!"
"5.0","The food at Genoa is good but the service is much better.  The blue haired princess named Nichole was very attentive, prompt and professional.  While working the register, making drinks, taking orders and delivering food she was on her game. I would definitely return to this place to see her again."
"5.0","We had the most amazing dinner last night for our anniversary. They had the table set with heart confetti and a lovely handwritten note to mark the occasion. They even had a gluten-free menu ready for me as I have a few dietary restrictions. Our waitress was extremely attentive and helpful. We both really enjoyed our meal; from the salads we had (Caesar and a field greens) to the main dishes (surf + turf for the husband and sirloin for me) to the sides (grilled asparagus for me and mashed potatoes for the husband). They even brought out a complementary dessert (cheesecake for the husband and raspberry sorbet for me) with happy anniversary stenciled in chocolate. Highly recommend for a delicious meal and a top notch experience for any celebration (or fun night out)."
"5.0","My wife and I came here before the Toby Keith Concert and we really liked this place! Food was great, service was good and staff were friendly! And one of the few places that permits Smoking which doesn't bother me at all! Would definitely go back!"

"2.0","Really disappointed. I ordered wings and they were not extra crispy like I asked and had hardly any sauce on them. the chicken tasted like it had been frozen and microwaved and then deep-fried. Very very bad. I got to say the pretzels were pretty good but the queso was not. And everything was super slow coming out of the kitchen for a restaurant that was ridiculously empty"
"4.0","The service is prompt and they keep you moving don't be turned away by the long lines at the door.  The prices are extremely fair too, coming from comparing this to brunch spots in Denver.  The portions are huge and just knocking off a star for how greasy/heavy it all was.  If that's the kind of food you're looking for, this is is!The short/tall stacks are the flat laying hotcakes you'll see in pics, while the specialty are the rolled up ones you see.  Came here the morning after Girasole while Bryan was TDY to Pittsburgh."
"3.0","Friendly waiters, nice vibe, but food and drinks are not good enough for me to come again."
"4.0","Stopped by the market and had to have lunch.  What a treat!  Look at the menu board and get in line.  Most items for a meal are $10 or less.  You can get a half portion.  My Chicken Tandoori over rice with Spinach Paneer was so flavorful and enough for 2 meals.  If you are in the area, don't miss it."
"4.0","Went to Pittsburgh recently and this place is a cute gem tucked away on a busy street in either shady side or squirrel hill. It not only feels vintage inside, but they also only accept cash, giving it an older kind of vibe. The staff were friendly, but not in that overbearing sort of way. Very refreshing! They are very laid back, but still make sure you get what you want. I ordered the chorizo hash and it was quite a lot of food! I ate it all of course, and I don't even regret it. Even if I could hardly move for a few hours following :P The eggs were cooked perfectly (over easy) and the broken yolk tasted great on top of the chorizo and hash browns. Definitely a great place for hangover food! The entire meal with two entrees, a side of bacon, chocolate milk, and coffee was only $30. Compared to San Diego prices, I found this to be amazing! Hit it up if you ever find yourself in Pittsburgh!"
"1.0","There I was, enjoying a night filled with libations, good conversation, and merriment when it all came grinding to a halt thanks to a 'wolf in waitress' clothing.' Being a poor student, yet feeling magnanimous, I decided to pay for my table's drinks. I sacrificed a small animal, and lo and behold a demon appeared. With fiery red hair, and a scowl to match, she told me she'd be happy to fetch the bill. She said her name was Melissa--I assume this was her 'human' name, since revealing her true form would surely destroy the entire establishment. I paid the bill with my debit card and fearing that my funds were running low, I left a 10 percent tip on the bill (just drinks mind you). Before I could leave the rest of the tip in cash, the check was snatched by her talons, and in a blaze she was gone. Moments later, I felt the icy touch of death on my back, with the words 'was there something wrong with the service?' spoken through forked tongue, sending a chill up my spine. Apologetically, I began to explain that everything was fine, and hurriedly fumbled through my wallet for a greater offering to the beast. Ashamed, I left the required (apparently) cash on the table, taking the tip to about 18 percent. Wanting to make a quick getaway lest I receive another dirty look, I gathered my party (about 4 people, each of whom tipped tipped to compensate my portion) and we began to exit. On my way out the door, Melissa felt the need to announce to the entire building that 'that guy only left a 10 percent tip!'Defeated, degraded, and emasculated I left her lair and called the manager the next day. He told me that 'this is really an issue for the owner' and never called me back. Overall, summit gets 5 stars for location, board games, and food. My waitress, however, gets 1 star and can go eat a fart."
"5.0","Charming restaurant in an old converted house. Great food & service too! Would highly recommend and come back."
"5.0","This was seriously the best Japanese food I have ever had. Everything was so fresh and delicious. Moreover, the service was just perfect. She came by just enough to make sure we were OK, but not enough to not disturb our meal. She was very sweet.I love you the homemade ginger salad dressing. The tuna roll, chicken yakitori and dumplings were delicious. Definitely returning here when I come back to Pittsburgh."
"3.0","Cool ambiance and an open kitchen, but calling this a sushi place is a bit of a misnomer in my opinion. They only offer rudimentary nigiri/sashami at fairly high prices. The cooked selections - like the octopus balls are quite good and more resoanbly priced. Drinlk list not bad, but somewhat weak/small for my tastes. Overall this is far more of a $$$ than a $$ place IMHO.The reason for 3 versus 4 stars is the level of service - while our server was friendly, we went 20 minutes waiting for  our first drink order. The food came out in a rush, then another long wait to order second round. when it gets to the point that i'm annoyed, its worth mentioning. I can't lay this at the establishments feet, but i found the clientele offputting somewhat. Neither my son nor i felt comfortable - and i'm the gregarious sort. Just not our kind of crowd i guess - not really hipster, but a vibe i can't put my finger on."
"5.0","Came in from Columbus on a business trip.  I noticed they had some very good beers via my Untappd app.  To say the least this place did not disappoint.  From the moment I walked in as a solo traveler I felt welcome.  Everyone at the bar and the staff were super friendly.  Very cool laid back vibe and atmosphere with open windows on this warmer October day.  The burger I had was amazing and I'd venture to guess everything on the menu is good.  The highly rated brews I consumed were only $4 for happy hour- extra bonus.  If I lived in Pittsburgh I could see this becoming my favorite bar/ gastro pub.  Can not recommend enough."
"5.0","I have been meaning to try out the tacos from this place, and I finally received the chance to do so this weekend.  I visited the Strip to try some of the hot chocolate from Mon Aimee (alas, it was out--apparently, they run out around noon) and visit a winery, and was not planning to order food.  However, as I walked around the corner on my way out of the winery, I was seduced by the smell of roasting meat, despite it being around 4pm.  I ordered two tacos, one chicken and one carnitas (pork), with everything, which cost $5.  When I ordered, the guy at the stand (Edgar, I assume), asked me if I wanted anything to drink, but I passed.  As I was waiting for my order, two women came up and ordered some tacos, and one also asked for a cup of the hot chocolate, which made my ears perk up (why did they not mention that drinks meant hot chocolate?!?).  Of course, then I had to get some hot chocolate, too!Upon receiving my hot chocolate and tacos, I sat down at one of the adjoining tables to consume them.  True to their claim, the tacos were some of the best I've had in Pittsburgh--the only other ones as good that I've had are from Las Palmas in Oakland.  In fact, I ate the chicken one so quickly that I didn't even think to add salsa to it, but it was still delicious!  I added salsa to the carnitas one before eating it, which made it all the more flavorful and delicious.  Both of the tacos were savory and crispy, and I greatly enjoyed them both, though I slightly preferred the chicken one.  The hot chocolate, which was a Mexican version with cinnamon, added a nice sweet note and finish to the meal, and filled me with warmth on this chilly day, helping to make up for the earlier disappointment from lack of the hot chocolate that I'd sought.Aside from the quality of food, the service was very friendly and pretty efficient.  The only drawback is that this is a food stand, which means that if the weather's unfavorable, you're stuck eating outside.  (Of course, there's nothing they can do about this, hence why I'm not detracting any stars.)  Given that I live and work in Oakland, Las Palmas is generally more convenient when I'm craving tacos. However, when I'm wandering around the Strip and am hungry, Edgar's surely hits the spot!"
"5.0","Love this place! Open late, friendly staff and most importantly, great pizza. My go-to spot after a night out in Oakland."
"2.0","Called late night from work, 3  hungry nurses...I asked the pleasant- sounding guy if the steak calzone was big enough for two to share...he replies, 'It's really big,  I can't usually finish half and I'm a pretty big guy.'  So I ordered it with confidence...asking for sauce on the side...along with breaded mushrooms and zucchini.  Imagine my surprise when the delivery guy hands me a small (10') pizza box...that's how small the calzone was, it didn't fill the box...no side of sauce...zucchini was very greasy and not crisp at all, very little flavor, mushrooms were 'good' per the nurse that ordered them (I wasn't impressed, but then I never order fried mushrooms).  I called them just to say how small the calzone was and two nurses who are working all night had to share the tiny calzone..with no sauce...I said it's our first time ordering and it would probably be the last...I got, 'that's understandable, sorry about that.'  The steak calzone tasted ok, but didn't have a lot of filling, alot of crust with not enough topping.  Too many choices in Oakland to waste $26.74 (30.00 with tip!) on this place that obviously doesn't care about retaining  new customers (we nurses talk, too! Word of mouth goes a long way in the hospital!)"
"3.0","Last night I dined at Capital Grille with my date to celebrate my birthday. This restaurant had really great reviews. I ordered the filet mignon with the Au Gratin potatoes and my date ordered the scallop dish. My steak was very tender and the sauce made it more flavorful but it was still bland for my liking. I didn't like the au gratin potatoes and my date didn't enjoy his scallops. The manager came by to check up on us and my date expressed his distaste for the scallop dish and was brought out a different scallop dish with 15 year old balsamic and it was delightful. I don't know if I would return to this restaurant. I wasn't blown away by the meal."
"5.0","Had dinner here after we arrived in Pittsburgh. It was located inside the station square. We had tempura, sushi rolls, teriyaki and some desserts. We chose Monongahela roll, which had eel, avocado and tobiko in it. We had shrimp and veggie tempura, which included shrimp, potato, sweet potato asparagus and etc. They all yummy! The chicken teriyaki was a little bit over cooked. I had matcha cheese cake and my friend had mochi ice cream for dessert, which served as a nice ending of our dinner."
"5.0","So, I will start by saying that I no longer live in Pittsburgh (Shadyside) but during the two years that I did, I went to Pamela's just about every weekend for their AMAZING crepe style hotcakes. I have never had anything like them - nor have I been successful in trying to make copycat recipes at home, much to my dismay. Now that I have moved away from Pgh, I have such huge cravings for these things and it is a shame that they are not readily available. For those that aren't into eating sweets for breakfast, just about everything I ever ordered was delicious. If visiting Pgh, this is an absolute MUST. You deserve a swift kick in the shins if you pass this breakfast place up. Cheers!"
"4.0","This is located in a great part of Pittsburgh near the universities and my favorite suburb, Shadyside. Fresh, hot, authentic Indian food and a clean, welcoming atmosphere. Servers are quick and on their toes filling up your water glasses, which you will need to wash down the few pounds of fresh food you consume from their buffet. However, a few things that were missing (may have been the day) was paneer and some sweet treats at the end of the buffet. Other than that- great bang for your buck!"
"5.0","All of their pies are delicious.  My favorite is the white boy.  The staff is extremely friendly.  Best pizza in Pittsburgh"
"5.0","Remarkable food, great service, and quality beer. Cinderlands is packed for a good reason, this is a good place to go for wonderful food and a fun evening.The booths create a fun personal space. If you want to watch a game you can sit at the bar, but otherwise, the screens are not obtrusive. The food is creatively prepared and everything is rather delicious. For example, the apple and smoked goat cheese in the Brussels Sprouts made it a tasty combination. Our server knew the menu quite well and was able to make helpful suggestions.  My only criticism is there could be a few more vegetarian entrees.  There are several veggie sides, enough to make a meal, bit nothing much to choose from on the entrees without making substitutioms. Cinderlands is a place to keep coming back to."
"4.0","This place is surprisingly good!  My family and I were captive customers, having already ponied up for pay-parking and having paid our admission to Phipps.  Then we got hungry.They have a nice menu, with plenty of fresh items, NOT the standard frozen chicken nuggets and hot-dogs.  I had some vegetarian chili that was very good, and came with some interesting flat-bread instead of crackers.  My kids enjoyed their lunches, as did my wife.Overall, this is a solid choice, so do not hesitate to give it a try and let us all know what you think."
"4.0","Great American Breakfast!  Very reasonably priced, and the service was spectacular!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the home fries were a tad cool at the center.  But the flavor was flawless, and everything was was spot on.  I recommend you give it a try.  You won't be disappointed.  Kudos to the restaurant!!"
"1.0","There pizza never tastes the same Also if you order a salad always ask for dressing because they will not offer any. There are other better pizza places in the area."

"5.0","Several unseasonably sultry evenings ago, as I trekked on foot from my job on 39th Street in Lawrenceville to Altar Bar in the Strip District to catch Iced Earth in concert by my lonesome, I noticed a building bedecked by vibrant colors, and therefore, saw an opportunity to try a restaurant I've passed too many times over the years without stopping in.When I entered, I saw a virtual United Nations in front of me dining in what very much resembled a cafeteria. Black people, brown people, white people, Muslims, Jews, and Libertarian Socialist Semi-Agnostic Caucasian Metalheads (well, at least one) could be seen partaking in Middle Eastern fare...as the Golf Channel (?) was on the telly.The counter was a display of ethnic culinary glory. Pies, rice, proteins, and many spicy, exotic dishes beckoned for my attention, but I didn't want to dally, so I ordered a sandwich. 'Hey, bra, what'll it be?' a man, also bald, with a husky frame, moustache, olive complexion, and accent asked me as if I was an old drinking buddy.'I want the Lamb Shawarma with fries,' I said. 'You been in here before?''Nah, but I've been wantin' to stop in.''You headed somewhere?''Yeah, a concert down at Altar Bar.''Nice, man. This will fill you up. Get a fountain drink, sit down, and I'll take care of you.'And sit down I did, close to the counter so that my new friend wouldn't have to walk that far.Yes, fountain drinks are self-serve here, and there's a 5 minute wait for sandwiches.What arrived in front of me was an Arabic hamburger. The plush pita bread held chunks of a shockingly fresh, abundant, minced, moist, and flavorful lamb that oozed juices and was surrounded by pickles, tomato, lettuce, onion, and...mayo? It certainly didn't taste like the tzatziki I am accustomed to, but therein lied the charm of the sandwich. It was almost as if Salem's wanted something on their menu that would be familiar to Americanized palates, giving the everyday diner a worldly twist on fast food. Also comforting were the golden, battered fries that crackled between my teeth. Not that I am at averse to ethnic food in the least. Regular readers of mine should know that. It's just that I was surprised at how 'American' this shawarma came off and didn't mind at all. In fact, I practically annihilated the shawarma out of its sheer delectability, all while feeling more than welcome in this microcosm of an increasingly diversified city and nation. And for under $10, does one really need to hit up The Clown or The Redhead? After I finished my sandwich, one that was nearly as large as a rolled-up newspaper, I tried to stifle a belch only to get a smile and a nod from one of the employees. 'Man,I knew you'd kill that shawarma,' I heard the man who served me say. I laughed, bid the folks at Salem's farewell, and made my way down to Altar Bar with a satiated stomach and a blissful heart. Note: I was so full, I didn't eat again until 11AM the following morning. That shawarma kept me nourished as I fist-pumped, shouted lyrics, and dodged moshers past midnight in the hot, magnetic concert environs.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGPNeNVAzw"

"5.0","Fantastic little place with delicious comfort food - something different every day. Everything I have tried so far has been fabulous, from the wagyu smoked brisket sandwiches to the housemade fudges and wide array of housemade barbecue sauces, and an amazing plate of Schnitzel  with spaetzle halusky (really good), carrots and gravy. I am looking forward to many more visits!"
"1.0","Wed. 10/7/15 4-5:30pmI walk into this unremarkable hole-in-the-wall pizza joint, I order a single slice with a few extra toppings, it comes out to $5.31. I hand the cashier my trusty debit card and after a couple times running it, she informs me it doesn't work.'Oh, that's odd. Shoot, I didn't bring my wallet on my bike. Okay. Well, thanks.'I take a step back and make a call to my bank, with all the traveling I do, occasionally security will red flag the card, but a quick phone call will unlock it. Unfortunately, 'due to a massive information leak, a lot of cards have been cancelled for security reasons'. After an extremely tedious round of 'brief holds' and being disconnected twice, I'm finally able to make a one-time transaction at the ATM. Success! Cash! That's the last time I leave the hotel with just my ID and one card!It's been nearly an hour. I'm spent. And really hungry. And now late for my massage appointment. But at least I can finally get this delicious pizza my friend talked about. I go to the counter and reorder my slice. I notice that now it is happy hour and one of the specials reads 'free appetizer with $5 purchase.' Pleased that some good has come out of wasting a hour on the phone, I ask about adding that happy hour deal to my order. The goateed cashier says, 'if you want to order a beer you have to go to the bar.' 'Oh, no beer, thank you, just the appetizer.' He repeats himself, I repeat myself, and accepting we must be experiencing a language barrier, I go to the bar anyway. I try to order my slice of pizza and an appetizer. The bartender says, 'You can't have ordered at the counter already to get the appetizer here. You have to order over five dollars at the bar.'I look back toward the counter, confused. 'No, I didn't order over there, I was told to come here.''You ordered earlier.' (I come to realize it's the same girl who ran my card before.)'Oh. Yes, I tried. But my card wouldn't go through so I called my bank. I have cash now. I'd like to order with the bar so I can get the appetizer for happy hour.'Her tone is escalating in rudeness, 'Yeah, well, you'll have to pay for that pizza from before and then order over five dollars from the bar.' She walks away to another customer at the bar. The gentleman next to me offers to let me order an appetizer on his tab since he has spent well over five dollars at the bar. Gratefully, I accept and we let the bartender know our plan. Again with the rude tone and a roll of her eyes, to boot, 'no. We can't do that.'I'm so frustrated. I give up. I've had it. Forget the damn pizza.'Okay, you know what, I don't want anything. Thanks.' I pick up my twenty from the bar and startto leave. The bartender apparently can't help herself from viciously spewing, 'Well if you can't afford it, maybe you shouldn't be here.' I'm stunned. 'What a rude, bitchy thing to say.''Hey, the truth hurts.'Then she ran away to the kitchen before I could respond.Of course you think of everything you would like to have said later... It would have gone something like... 'Broke? You work at a fucking pizza place, Bitch.'Shocked, frustrated, humiliated, I asked for the manager at the counter. A tall, thin, Indian-looking man stretching pizza dough in the back stays rooted to the spot and hollers, 'I'm the manager, what's the problem?' 'Could you come over here, please?' He sighs and begrudgingly approaches the counter. I take a breath to calm my irritation so I can communicate effectively. At the end of my account, he looks at me blankly, unsympathetically, and says, 'what do you want me to do?'I can't believe it. 'What do I want you to do?!'With attitude he says, 'We are busy right now. We don't have time for this. You want a piece of pizza?! I'll make you a piece of pizza!'(Busy is not what I would call the place. The large first room of tables is completely empty. On the counter side, there is a table of six, a table of four, maybe six people at the bar, and no line to order. Five guys making pizza and two serving girls.) I'm disgusted with this place and appalled with the alarming opposite of customer service, 'No, I don't want your pizza.''Well, what do you want me to do? I can't fire her right now because we are very busy.''No, I don't want you to fire her.''Well, what do you want me to do? I can't fire her right now because we are very busy.''No, I don't want you to fire her.''Well, what do you want me to do?!''Nothing. Forget it.'That was it. I left. Wow. My day really went down hill with the decision to go to Genoa.As I rode back to the hotel, I was frustrated with myself for letting some snotty, trashy, pudgy, $8-an-hour-plus-tips bar tender get to me. I've done my time in customer service and food service. I was great at it. Then I moved on and built a career. Now my work pays me to travel all over North America and Europe doing what I love. Who's broke now, Bit"
"4.0","Great little bar, with a nice selection of draft, craft beers and even more bottle beers including my favorite Ballast Point's Sculpin IPA. The music is very good, Etta James and Van Morrison along with more contemporary artists. Ordered the olives and charcuterie.  Nice presentation for the simple order and it came out quickly. The food was perfect for a slow afternoon of gazing at the peek-a-boo view of downtown Pittsburgh. The server was helpful, knowledgable and gave us plenty of room to just enjoy the ambiance. The music was a tad loud to carry on a deep conversation, but to just sit and reflect, it was a great spot."
"5.0","I just have to say how absolutely impressed I was with our experience this evening. First of all, the food was absolutely delicious. Everything we had was so good and well worth the reasonable prices. The best of all was our waiter George. He was funny, attentive, made friends with all of us including the children. He was so well versed in all of the menu items and answered all of our questions. Being my birthday, he even helped my family surprise me with a candle lit dessert. It was by far the best dining experience I have had in a long time. We will definitely be back and telling friends to stop by."
"5.0","I've never eaten in the actual place because I always get takeout.  But, they have the best pizza.  There isn't a inch thick layer of rubbery cheese.  Its melty and delicious!  The crust also isn't soggy.  Its not greasy either.  It's my favorite pizza place downtown!  I never had a problem with them!"
"4.0","This is a fancy place for special occasions. It's clearly an expensive restaurant, but the quality of food and service matches the price. The filet mignon was perfect; I savored every bite. And for dessert, the flourless chocolate espresso cake was rich, but not overly sweet. I wouldn't go here often, but if I did end up here, I know it would be a wonderful experience."
"4.0","I came here while visiting a friend this past weekend and ordered the bacon, egg, and cheddar on a croissant. The croissant was so light and fluffy and I really enjoyed it. Their ordering system did confuse me a bit and seemed quite inefficient. You stand in line and order at a register and  they tell you a table number, which you have to search for after you order."
"3.0","I didn't have a bad experience here, but I was a little underwhelmed. I got the Mexican War. It was good, nothing spectacular. There were very little chiles (maybe 1.5 small pieces) - the bites that included them were definitely better than without. The patties aren't very thick, which I wasn't a fan of. Of course, I had to get a milkshake. I got a simple chocolate shake and I was pretty disappointed. I paid $7 and it tasted the same (if not worse) as a McDonald's shake. NOT worth the price at all. I also tried the rosemary fries, and they were decent - very little rosemary was pathetically sprinkled on top. Overall, the burgers are okay, the shakes aren't worth it, and the fries are overrated. It's still a good place to try, but I don't think I'll be going back."
"4.0","Came here from out of town great food great drinks and even better staff. Ashley was great and never let our drinks run low!"
"5.0","Coming from a place where beef is king, I am usually weary of establishments that do their own blends of burgers. Usually you can sort of identify the taste or concept they are going for, but rarely does it actually amount to something great. In this case it was perfect. I had the fox chapel burger and the flavor profiles were absolutely amazing. Even the salad was excellent. Although a little pricey, it is well worth it for the level of burger craft that goes on here, easily my favorite burger in Pittsburgh in terms of flavor. The beers were also excellent and reasonably priced, I will definitely be back to try more Burgh'ers soon!"
"3.0","Enjoyed a couple of drinks here with friends after dinner downstairs. The atmosphere was super nice and there's plenty of space, so it wasn't too crowded even for a weekend evening. Drinks were pretty good; we enjoyed a couple classics (moscow mule & mojito), and tried one of their watermelon cocktails which was okay, although too sugary for our liking. Service was also alright - although we were seated at the bar, it took quite some time to flag down a bartender, and even then, our drinks were forgotten several times. It was a busy night and the bar was definitely pretty lively, so we'll have to try again sometime when the crowd is more manageable."
"4.0","Delicious as always.  What more can really be said?  I always get the crepe pancakes with brown sugar and sour cream.  I remember when you could only get them with strawberries, but blueberries are now an excellent alternative.Their coffee is as spectacularly terrible as ever.  It's been bad for as long as I can remember, like they're intentionally not serving good coffee.  It's the only thing from keeping Pamela's from being a 5-star breakfast place.  Regardless, Pamela's is still a Pittsburgh classic and always a great breakfast destination."
"2.0","This is a sports bar in downtown Pittsburgh with a long narrow setup. There is a bar along the wall with six screens behind the bar. On the other side there are tables. It has the layout of a bar, not a restaurant with a bar attached. I came in and sat at the bar and asked for a screen to be changed to a game I wanted to watch. They obliged; there was not much else going on in sports. The beer list has about 10 or so drafts, though not everything on their published beer list is in stock. I asked for a Dogfish 60 Minute IPA, but it was out of stock so I ordered a Southern Tier IPA. The food menu is standard sports bar fare, with a selection of burgers and sandwiches. I ordered a Tuscan chicken sandwich, which was fine, but the menu said it came with steak fries but instead came with chips. The main problems were in the service area. They had one overtaxed bartender working behind the bar, who had a little trouble keeping up with all her patrons. To top it all off, they committed what I feel was a violation of sports bar etiquette: despite the fact that I specifically asked to watch an NBA game, when the Pirates game started and a patron asked to see the Pirates, they proceeded to turn all six screens to the Pirates game. Despite being a violation of etiquette, it was unnecessary as the bar was not crowded and there weren't Pirates fans throughout the bar.  At other bars I go to, they leave a screen on a game in progress that a patron is watching, or at a minimum they could ask if is OK to switch the game.  This bar would do well to heed that rule. The prices turned out to be a little on the high side. The IPA was $7 for a draft. That's kind of high, as I can usually get drafts of similar quality for $5.50 or $6.00."
"5.0","Amazing. Arabic/middle eastern restaurant and store. TRY THE NA'AN , it's to die for."
"4.0","We went early on a Sunday and it was pretty empty. The staff was friendly. They had a good range of beers and they offer a flight of 4. The fried chicken sandwich is a good alternative if you don't want a burger but their fox chapel burger is delicious. It's a mixture of beef and mushrooms but mushroom lovers won't hate it bc you don't really taste them. The goat cheese is creamy and the balsamic gives it a great taste. Mac n cheese is not really worth it, so order the rosemary fries!"
"1.0","Horrible experience.  I wish I knew the bartenders name she tried her best to get things done. Wait time for a party of 1 (me) was 1 1/2 hours.  A seat at the bar opened up so I only waited an hour. After sitting I order lunch and got it an 1hr. 40min later. Came in from CA to watch a Steeler game and wanted to give this place a shot. Overall wait time, I walked in at 12pm walked out around 3pm. Also I still had to pay full price. Fist time last time."
"5.0","My husband, seven month old daughter, and two friends met at Cinderlands in March and had a fantastic experience! Though the entrance is small and assuming, the interior is beautifully updated in an industrial aesthetic and twice as large as I had anticipated. I was skeptical about taking my infant, and she was initially the first child in the restaurant. However, (thankfully) she was well behaved, and eventually, one or two other children arrived as well.The beers were literally made for us! My friend and I love Belgians, and there were two delicious Belgian offerings on the menu that weekend. I also enjoyed trying a rich stout and a crisp pale ale (which I loved, though I normally dislike that style). Everything that we ordered hit the spot!The food delivered as well. We ordered a number of things including the Marcona Almonds, Pierogies, Scotch Egg, and Brussel Sprouts. The Scotch Egg was definitely the table's favorite dish, and we inhaled the two that we ordered.I had a fantastic experience at Cinderlands and can't wait to return in the future! Do keep in mind that the menu -- particularly the beers -- change frequently, so have an open mind every time that you come here."
"3.0","I have been there a couple times, the food overall is fine except for the dessert. The reason why I give 3 stars is because the experience of making an reservation through phone call. The lady hang up on me twice. After the first one I don't even know if the reservation is done so I have to call again and the lady on the other side just said yes and hang up directly again. Are them really this busy?"
"4.0","Good value for the dollar. I had a western omelette and the lyonnaise potatoes.  Both were good. ServiceWS speedy and efficient. This is a greatPlace to grab breakfast and go. Two small issues. First they are cash only. Second, due to the high noise level it's not a good place to have a meal and chat. The flat unfinished walls may play a role in the noise level."
"5.0","Affordable, authentic, and delicious food at a great price! The nachos with the queso dip and guacamole dip were the perfect appetizer. Both dips as well as the chips had a unique flavor and texture and really impressed us. The dips were very creamy and reminiscent of the flavors they were suppose to represent with the perfect level of kick to them. The chips were freshly made and had a uniquely soft crunch to them.The chicken quesadilla was HUGE and was big enough for both of us which we both felt was a great deal for the price. Succulent chicken, a toasty tortilla, melted cheesiness and some veggies to add freshness is exactly what you look for in a chicken and cheese quesadilla. We look forward to coming back here soon and trying some of the other delicious food on the menu."
"5.0","I love this place!  I wish I would have tried it earlier!  The quality for the value is excellent.  There is no booze and seating is limited so be prepared.  They write your order on a post it note and it's made right behind the bar.  I love the beef nachos.  I might be addicted. The chicken tacos are great too.  As much as I hope this place is very successful, I hope the word doesn't get out.  Right now the small space seems to work well for the volume of customers. The"
"5.0","This place never let's me down. Great beer and always fantastic food. The asparagus plate is great. The roasted brussel sprouts are like no other. I have never ordered anything that I was not very happy with. Service is always good, even when it is crazy busy."
"4.0","Came here for a date night before going to see Nightmare Before Christmas symphony at the Heinz. We made a reservation the day before which seemed to be handy, as the restaurant was quite full on that Thursday evening!They have a pretty concise and straightforward menu; small, medium, and large plates as well as pizza. We ended up sharing the chicken sausage pizza and the squash gnocchi medium plate. The pizza was a good size for sharing (11'), and the squash gnocchi was a perfect portion. In my opinion it was a great modest portion for someone like me who isn't a big eater and didn't want leftovers since we were about to head to a show. The pizza had a good amount of the chicken sausage as well as some pickled sweet peppers for great texture and tanginess. The squash gnocchi was served with some great smoked chicken, mushrooms, and a delicious sauce. Many of the other menu items, charcuterie, as well as dessert looked interesting, although we didn't get to try them out. It looked as though they had plenty of options for different dietary preferences. The service was also polite and efficient; we were in and out within an hour easily. Definitely a great choice if you're in the area and looking for a nicer meal out!"

"1.0","Wow.  The Manager is one of the biggest toolbags I've ever come across.    Scenario: 18 ppl at the bar, 11-12 women.  The  rest of the bar is empty.   They have several TV's behind the bar.  My cousin and I were at the corner, and requested the Notre Dame Football game be put on TV in front of us.  Now, I'm a bar guy, so I completely understand the ins and outs.  This clown says, I'm sorry, we don't switch games on any TV, that's our policy.    What???? You fool?  There's nobody here.  Nobody is watching any of these games you have on said TV's?  Nope, sorry, we don't do Me:  Check, please.  Whoever the owners are, your Managers is an asshole.  Your bartenders are great,  and fyi: they all hate the guy as well. Apparently this has happened before.  He's costing you business.Oh, and the food ain't exactly bringing ppl back either."

"4.0","Came here a few days after opening. Our server was very nice and attentive. The burgers were great--juicy and flavorful! Upgraded to the rosemary fries and was verrrry happy with that decision!Ended the evening with shakes made with Millie's ice cream...so delicious.All in all the experience was great, my only qualm was the price! Husband upgraded to a bison burger and it was ~$18!! Yikes!"
"5.0","I absolutely love Caf√© Phipps, and eating here is always a treat. Combined with an actual trip into Phipps, and a meal here can easily be part of a perfect afternoon or evening.The cafe itself is a lovely, bright, colorful part of Phipps' main lobby and floor. In my experience it's always been well maintained, i.e kept very clean with plants and candles put out on the tables. The framed photos of fields and fresh produce hanging on the walls just complete the cafe's fresh and vibrant look and feel.While the menu itself (and the ingredients of what's sold here) often changes with the season and availability of produce, the general idea of the menu is always the same - you can order or mix-and-match soups, salads, sandwiches, a couple entree-items at times, and a quiche of the day. There are also usually smaller bites and side dishes like fruit cups, as well as dessert options like cupcakes. And as far as I know, all of the items are made from fresh, organic, and local ingredients, or brought in from local vendors.And I have to say, nothing here has let me down. The soups in particular always impress me - you can tell that their tomato soup is freshly made and it's always very think and pulpy; I feel healthier and happier just looking at it! Their salads are always a lovely blend of veggies and dressing (and meat if you opt for it, although Phipps is very vegetarian friendly), and the sandwiches have been perfectly toasted and to die for in my experience. Honestly it's impossible for me to leave without a smile on my face after eating here, the ingredients used are just so wonderful and perfect together.Oh, and since Phipps is one of the green leaders in town, it should come as no surprise that they aim to recycle and compost the few dishes and silverware items that can't be washed and reused.I seriously have no complaints about this little eatery. The best part about the cafe is that a visit to Phipps, while recommended, is not required. So if you want a healthy and/or tasty meal, this is definitely the place to go!"
"5.0","Hands down best tacos I have ever had! The price being super reasonable is just an added bonus. I would easily pay $5 a piece for these tacos, so you cant beat $3/taco. I have only tried the carnitas, chicken, and one of the specials and they were all amazing! I always want to order three tacos because they are that good, but two tacos will fill you up just fine."
"5.0","Exceptional as always. Great wait staff. Perfectly executed food. I highly recommend the Kona rubbed bone in New York strip."

"4.0","The lines on a weekend are a pain, but in the end, on a beautiful summer night, you arrive on a gorgeous rooftop. Being on a rooftop on a nice night feels like the world is open and full of possibilities; I love it.Strung lights, nice wooden tables, trendy atmosphere. Fancy drinks that are pricey but delicious and I guess you pay for the ambiance also.I'm so excited for good weather to come (consistently) so that we can celebrate rooftops again! :D"
"4.0","I stopped by here last week with my wife for a happy hour with some of her coworkers.  Upon entering the building on the first floor we saw that the steps were closed and knowing that the beer garden was on the third floor, we had to ask how to get upstairs.  The hostess directed us to the elevator which is in the exact opposite corner of the restaurant as the one that you enter from.  This seemed to be somewhat counter intuitive as I would think you would want people to be able to get to all of your spaces.  Once we finally made it upstairs you could tell that this was a pretty awesome place. There was a bar the length of the roof as well as a good number of tables.  The tables were not crowded in though and left plenty of room for standing around and hanging out.  The decor consisted of gas lamps with some stringed lights in-between and also what I think is a retractable glass roof that was open the night that we were there.  Their beer list was pretty decent and had about 20 different beers.  Most of these I think were seasonal since it was autumn and the list was dominated by pumpkin beers.  Our server ended up being pretty nice to us and I found service to be decent especially for the number of people that were there.The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  While I found the beers themselves to be somewhat overpriced, the vibe of the place was pretty awesome and is what would get me to come back again."
"3.0","I've waited a bit to write this review because for me this branch deserves a 3.5 star review; however, Yelp confines me to whole stars so I lean towards a 3. I've been here quite a few times for lunch and in between writing sessions in the library. It's always quite busy, particularly during semesters, and sometimes it's a bear to wait in line for a while. The quality of the food is always good, and the staff seem competent and friendly. I've been disappointed here a few times that the types of bagels I want are not available later in the afternoon. Sometimes, there are only a couple of types of bagels left as early as 3pm. I wish they had a variety of bagels available throughout the entire day rather than 'while supplies last.' Overall, though, I enjoy this place and will continue to frequent. Their black bean soup is amazing."
"4.0","A great place to grab a sandwich if you're in the strip district for the day. This place is a classic just like Primanti Brothers. Fast quick and easy the workers are welcoming and kind. I stoped in on a Sunday to get a sandwich with my girlfriend. We both got the Italian and it was great. The Italian dressing is made with balsamic vinegar which makes it a little different and unique. The bread is soft and fresh. I added mayonnaise to my sandwich and it gave it a great little addition of creamy to pair with the acid of the vinegar. I personally prefer the original location in North Side. Although the strip district location accepts credit cards!  If you've not tried Peppi's sandwiches you've not had a true Pittsburgh experience. Their menu has something for everyone and you will not leave disappointed."
"5.0","Had veal romano, it was excellent, some of the best veal I have had in a restaurant in years.  The pasta was also very good, I chose the Gorgonzola sauce, also very good.   The waitress was very friendly and the cost was reasonable."

"5.0","I went for music trivia night, which was so much fun! The atmosphere was very laid back and the place truly felt like it was just an old fashioned neighborhood hang out. I had an Arsenal cider and the browned butter popcorn to munch on. It was very tasty and a nice, cheap option with my drink. The place wasn't too crowded but there were still about 6 or 7 teams for the trivia. My big group was able to get a table which was great! I hope to go back for another fun night!"
"4.0","Never a bad meal/breakfast.   Fast hot and delicious.  And i don't have to cook.   Bonus.   Great place a must try for all ."

My husband appreciates the craft beer selection and I love the ever changing list of cocktails. The atmosphere is laid back and the bartenders are the best! They also always have great vegetarian options on the menu. Another bonus, they serve water filtered through a Berkey. I can't wait to go back!"
"5.0","Great atmosphere, excellent service, must stop before any event at the stadium. Reasonable prices, great food and a fun, party atmosphere.  Football themed menu and decor of course. Bar staff is knowledgeable and helpful."
"5.0","This place is reaaally good. I was a little unsure because some of the food didn't sound familiar, but it all ended up being tasty. I got the steak panini with pepperjack which was excellent. Husband got the same thing and loved it. I got a side of mac & cheese which was pretty good, not the best, but still good. Husband got french fries as his side and they were better than average restaurant fries. They had something extra on the outside that made them more crunchy. We got delivery through grubhub and it was very quick considering we live in South Hills, and the food was still hot.OH, and other notes about the steak panini since I'm super picky. It had that really thin shaved steak, like you'd get on a cheesesteak. Really nice, no fat or gristle or anything funky. The onions were sauteed, so no need to worry about raw onions. The pesto + dressing ended up tasting kind of like chipotle/spicy mayo with the pesto as a twist."
"4.0","The small plates were amazing: delicious and complex (crab tartine and burrata); the large plates were good (mushroom risotto and shrimp fra diavalo). Super cute space! And wait staff were great."

"5.0","We got 5:15pm dinner reservations on Valentine's Day since we figured it would get busy (which it did) and we got to sit in one of their cool wheel tables. Dont know what to call them but they look neat. They have a large bar, with flat screens showing the game and on the opposite side large painting of different animal: grizzly bear, fish, birds etc. Has a cool industrial meets vintage feel so I was lovely it. So...the food...first of we started with a ginormous root beer float just cuz and I got blue piont oysters as an appetizer.  Wow, they were fresh,  salty and not one speck of sand. For dinner I got the Mexican Shrimp Volcano that had a lobster claw, a large portion (maybe 6 or 8) of jumbo Tiger shrimp, at least 6 big sprigs of grilled asparagus all strategically placed on very yummy mashed potatoes. It was very good, hearty and had a lot of different elements that blended well together.  The bright  star of the dinner though was the Lobster Mac and Cheese...holy cow this was amazing.  I know because my husband made the mistake of giving me a bite and I of course had to have more (thank God for the large portion they give you).  The pasta,  cheese sauce...wow the cheese sauce was so good I am getting hungry just thinking about it. Not only were the bare bones of the dish hands down great but there was a surprising amount of lobster in it. My husband had to continuously get his knife so he could cut the large portions of lobster he was finding... not common for most places who attempt this dish. The Lobster Mac and Cheese here by far is one of the top favorite dishes I have ever eaten - absolutely spectacular.  The whole experience was such a treat - this restaurant has it all. Great decor, awesome food, helpful staff  and our server Davin knew all the ins and outs of the menu. We even got to chat a bit with Luke himself and were surprised to find out he used to be a street foods vendor.  Pretty cool. Again going down to this restaurant was a complete treat. We felt welcome from beginning to end and we will definitely be back. Highly recommended this establishment and if you want great service ask for Davin."
"2.0","I used to dine here every few years, but the last two times were a disappointment. The overall quality of the food seems to have gone downhill, with less emphasis on traditional Italian cooking. Some of our pasta was underdone (not al dente), and the seasonings were on the bland side. An exception is the turkey Devonshire, which isn't exactly Italian, but is a Pittsburgh original.I wouldn't go back for Italian entrees, but it was the overpriced and underwhelming salad that was so bad I had to write about it.After ordering our entrees, the waiter asked if we would like soup or salad. I chose a Caesar salad, assuming that this was included in the price of the entree, as it is at most restaurants. I don't mind paying $7 for a salad, but I like to know that I'm paying for it, and this Caesar salad was not worth $7. It wasn't even a Caesar salad. It was a small side salad of iceberg lettuce and croutons with Italian dressing. If I had known I would be charged for it, I would have asked for Parmesan cheese and maybe some anchovies."
"5.0","My family and I have frequented this restaurant for some years now. I write today because I'm always impressed with the consistency of their quality and great tasting food. This is hands down the BEST place in the city for middle eastern food! Their customer service is outstanding and welcoming. I enjoy the peaceful, friendly atmosphere with its casual vibe. If you're in the mood for tasty, food and a plethora of options this is the place for you. EVERYTHING I've ever had was scrumptious!I would highly recommend this place to the burger fans. There's a butcher on the opposite of the restaurant, in the market. So the meat is fresh & halal. Then you can have beef bacon if you like a bacon cheeseburger. Also,the spicy chicken dish, tikka masala dish and lamb shank is tasty and plentiful. The portions are enough for two or leftovers. The people working there are informative, kind and willing to answer any questions. This is just always a nice experience m: from the vibe of the place, to the food and the friendly service. I'll be back here for years to come."
"5.0","I like Indian cuisine and this restaurant lives up to my expectation. I'm not the right person to say it's authentic or not, but the wide range of food gives me such feeling. I'm vegetarian so I just tasted one third of the lunch buffet. I like the naan and the masala."
"4.0","Cheap, decent pizza? 2am and stomach growling? LITTLE NIPPER'S. There really isn't much more to say. Little Nipper's has been there for me every time and the staff is both speedy and courteous. Last week, I walked from East Carson to Craig (partially barefoot, because I made the idiotic decision to wear 5-in heels) and seeing the dimly lit 'OPEN' sign at 2:27am was salvation. I am forever yours, Little Nippers."
"5.0","I was actually really nervous to come here based on some of the earlier mixed reviews.  Since I chose this place to surprise Bobby on his birthday, I was praying to the restaurant and Yelp gods that they would send us good service AND good food and they did not disappoint!  I made our reservation for 9 on a Friday evening and Bobby was so confused when we got there!  You walk up a narrow, steep stair case to the floor above Round Corner and its like you are entering a completely different world.  It wasn't very busy around 9, but started to pick up toward the end of our meal.Our waitress was so cute and informative.  She did an excellent job explaining the layout of the menu, any item we inquired about and gave some really good recommendations.  We ended up starting with the quail egg, chicken and shitake mushroom skewers, each ordered our separate entr√©e (I did the ramen with the 5:10 egg...Excellent. and Bobby ordered an eggplant dish with ground chicken and sauce per our waitress's suggestion and he also really liked it), a sushi hand roll (salmon), and the fried oyster dish.  I tried the cocktail similar to a Moscow mule and Bobby tried the pop-rock cocktail and we both had shots of the hibiscus infused sake.  Everything was a 10 out of 10 in flavor, presentation and delivery.After we finished, we were both comfortably food and not overly stuffed.  Our bill was only $74 for the entire variety and multiple options we ordered.  I think this would be a really cool place to go back for a happy hour or just drinks and small bites, but it was also perfect for a different kind of birthday dinner I knew Bobby would enjoy.Great food, excellent service and the decision that we will most definitely return in the future earned Umami 5 stars...and that completes my 100th review!"
"4.0","Unassuming atmosphere.  Staff was pleasant.  We started with the mixed appetizer plate.  It was good....not great but good.     Dinner choice was green curry with nests of rice noodle, and tempura veggies and a side salad.  The portion was big enough to share.   Not the best Thai in town but good food at great prices."
"4.0","I'm really going to miss this place. For the past 2 months that I've been working in PIT, Umami has been a staple order for me through Postmates - I love the freshness of the ingredients and the sheer deliciousness of everything. Umami can perhaps be called a more fusion-y take on japanese food, but not in a tasteless or odd way that fusion food often ends up. I haven't had a bad dish at Umami. though I will say their ramen is not amazing, so maybe order another one of their many amazing dishes on the menu instead. --Yaki udon - my fave dish. I could eat this everyday. Al dente udon noodles with a perfectly cooked onsen egg, dried mushrooms, chili powder, shaved beets, and lots of cabbage. This is the type of meat less fish I could eat all the time. The mix of tastes and ingredients made this comfort food. --Chawanmushi - only truly legitimate Japanese restaurants serve chawanmushi, and I was pleasantly surprised at this. It's served with thin slices of pumpkin and scallions on top, and is so smooth and not too salty. --Temaki - I loved the salmon or the unagi ones. The unagi here is heavier and saltier than the usual types, with thick sauce covering it. I appreciate how the seaweed is crisp and the servings of rice is generous. --Okonomoyaki - ive tried this at other teppanyaki places and it's a little different here - a little saltier especially with the bacon slices and mayo on top. But so delicious, and fried to a crisp at all the right parts. I loved the crunch of the cabbages in the pancake. --others like takoyaki, nigiri etc...they've all been really good. It can get pricey if you order the small dishes, so maybe that's why it's not 5 stars yet for me. The atmosphere is also modern, young, like a hip bar, with great happy hour specials. I recommend making a trip here in person, not just ordering it online!"
"5.0","I'm from Chicago. There's literally 100's of Chinese/Cantonese restaurants and I've personally been to dozens. Chinatown Inn has the best egg rolls I've ever had in my life. I tried 3 different, since they came highly recommended, and boy they didn't disappoint. Picking a favorite one is like picking a favorite child. Also, for the heat lovers, the Kung Pao Chicken will scratch your itch. Highly recommend."
"4.0","Very trendy atmosphere where the food and brews are all local sourced. Great selection on tap! Not surprisingly they specialize in burgers with some terrific choices and a build your own if you don't find one to your liking. I had the 'Mexican War' with its great buttery taste and some heat. The pierogis as a side were fantastic. Don't sleep on the fried chicken either. It too was a pleasure. Prices very reasonable."
"2.0","Honestly the food here is...well...yucky. I've gotten delivery several times because sometimes I get a hankering for quick, cheap, indian food and am always disappointed. Every entree i've gotten has come with an entire INCH of grease pooled at the top! So gross. Will not order from here again."
"2.0","This review is related to an order i placed through 'Postmates' (delivery service).  Placed order around 8:00 PM though the Postmates link.  Ordered the signature cheeseburger, truffle fries, and wedge salad.  There was also an option for homemade mint lemonade or a fresh made iced tea with a simple syrup.Burger was delivered used down in half and the burger itself looked good but did not deliver on taste. this could be because it was takeout, so not too hot (although it is 5 blocks from my hotel so not a long ride). Fries were over salted, nice truffle flavor but again, seemed to have been made much earlier.  The wedge was the most disappointing because i was looking forward to what is described as wedge with blue cheese and applewood smoked bacon  Got the iceberg lettuce and some bacon but no blue cheese.  Also no utensils, or napkins.  And possibly a ranch or creamy italian dressing.  very disappointing.  Not sure this is a fair review because it was ordered though the service but should just be a pickup service that they grab the bag and deliver and because of that i think it bears mentioning that this did not live up the Capital Grill level of service and product."
"2.0","Unfortunately I was not impressed with Doce Taqueria. Not sure how they have a 5 star rating, I've had way better tacos from many other places around Pittsburgh. Service was great and their prices are decent so no complaints there. First off their menu is SO small. Only 5 taco choices and only ONE vegan/vegetarian choice. :( I understand having a small menu but only offering 1 vegetarian option alienates a large group of people. Since I'm mostly vegetarian I had to order 2 of the same tacos. Would have been nice to have at least 2 vegetarian taco options and maybe even 1 fish taco option. The veggie tacos weren't bad but extremely plain. I felt they could have been a little more creative with the tacos. I also ordered the nachos. They were not very good. The chips you could tell were an extremely cheap/generic brand same with the melted cheese wiz type cheese. They have the right idea with the toppings on the nachos but need to have better quality chips and cheese. Will not bother eating at Doce Taqueria again unless they expand their menu, then I will give them a second try."
"1.0","I'm sorry, this place is simply not good. Unfortunately, it is yet another example of poorly made Americanized Italian food. Too much cheese, too much butter and cream, and quite possibly the worst bread I have ever consumed at any Italian restaurant in my life. Someone had to go out of their way to find bread this flavorless and awful. It's already a travesty that it's served to me before the meal, but to put it on my sandwich! I'm actually offended for Italians, and bread. Yes bread, this is not your best. The eggplant Parmesan served to my mother was soggy, covered with an absurd amount of plastic Parmesan cheese swimming in a bland sauce. My fathers pasta, cream and cheese. Contrary to popular believe, this is not traditional Italian! This is what some would refer to as, terrible and heavy. And the cannoli? Words could not describe my disappointment.I'll admit it, I'm already an Italian food snob. I cook tons of Italian food for myself, family, and friends, and I only use the highest quality ingredients and go about preparing my meals in traditional southern Italian ways. I've had phenomenal Italian meals at the few great Italian restaurants in this city, so whenever I get the opportunity to eat at another 'Italian' joint, I'm heading in with high expectations.Is this what Italian food in Pittsburgh has come too? Seeing other similar Italian places in Bloomfield, I'm sad to say...yes. I'm actually slightly upset even writing this because the waitstaff is charming, and I hear the owners are great, but to pass this off as representative of Italian food is an injustice. If you want a truly great Italian meal please look elsewhere."

Additionally, Hours can be misleading, on Saturdays although they claim they're open till 1030pm, kitchen closes earlier than 10pm, so if you show up at 10pm you're out of luck. Parking used to be convenient, however with new construction around parking can be a pain"

NEVER GOING BACK!"

"3.0","I think Bettis Grill is an ok spot for a quick bite, but  it's more of a tourist spot vs. a local spot.I got Fish Tacos and pierogies.  First, the pierogies were amazing.  I could have gotten those by themselves and that would have been ok.  The onions and sour cream adds to the taste and they were cooked exactly the way I eat them, crispy yet soft.The fish tacos felt like they were missing some flavor.  The toppings helped, but the meat itself was flavorless.  It tasted like frozen fish, defrosted and heated up, then thrown on a taco shell.  I added some salt and pepper which made it taste just ok.  But nothing to write home about.However, the service was great!"
"5.0","Best taco stand in the Burgh! My first stop at Edgar's was about three years ago.... I was walking by the stand and saw Troy Polamalu (no joke) sitting with his family at a table out on the sidewalk enjoying tacos, so of course I had to stop! I must say, Troy knows what's good! Their tacos are incredible! So fresh & delicious-- and affordable at only $5 for 2. Over the years, I have tried all of the tacos they offer and they never disappoint! The fish is prob my favorite -- and def try the free salsas they have on the counter! The salsa verde is excellent. One bite of Edgar's tacos & you'll be hooked!"
"3.0","I love indian food and I consider Tamarind as Pittsburgh's one of the best indian places. The portions are generous and service is great. I got the usual chicken tikki masala and the sauce was great to dip in my garlic naan. My bf got some lamb dish with green sauce ( I dont remember the name) which had unique great flavor as well. I asked my dish to be spicy but it was not. I know I am pretty good with spicy food but I know how HOT Indian food can get. So this one thing put me down a little on my visit but other than this, the soft chicken went well with fluffy white rice warm naan. The lamb was tender too and didn't give off that 'lamb smell' much. Everytime I go back to Pittsburgh, Tamarind is always on my 'must go back' list. The staff will greet you kindly, prices are reasonable for the generous portions, and the food comes out quick enough so you don't start to get frustrated. I would give 3.5 stars. Even though it is my fav indian place in Pittsburgh, I feel like there is a better place somewhere out there. So as of now, it is a 3.5 for me~"
"5.0","Okay let me tell you something. When I lived in Shadyside when I was in middle school (around 2002-2004), my mom and I ate a Pamela's religiously. Best. Breakfast. Ever.When I moved back to my hometown Chicago after my 2 year life in Pittsburgh, we tried finding a breakfast place just as good in Chicago. Never happened. It is now 10 years later, nothing better than Pamela's from pittsburghI missed Pamela's so much (and pittsburgh in general, sure), that last summer in 2013 my friends and I drove the 8 hours from Chicago to Pittsburgh just so I can experience Pamela's again.It was just as good as it was 10 years ago - and I told the waitress that myself. We will be making another 1-night trip again this summer. They are hooked.Nothing like Pamelas. Nothing. Oh the memories..."

I ordered my delivery through grubhub and not only was my dinner delivery fast, the food was AMAZING!

I will definitely be ordering from here again!"

"5.0","I finally made it to Umami last weekend (pathetically late to the party imo) and I'm happy to say I wasn't let down by the experience. Our server was attentive without being overbearing, which is difficult to do and always appreciated. The inside was dimly lit and stylish (much like my beloved t√§k≈ç) and it seemed like a fun place to hang out and drink for a while. I had some yellowtail sashimi and the ginger ginger cocktail. The former was delicious, fresh, and smooth, but the latter was too sweet and lacked the gingery bite I was hoping for. It was essentially a basic Moscow Mule. My dining companion had a cocktail I liked better though (I believe it was whiskey-based) so I will try and get that next time. I also sampled some pork belly, which was chewy and sweet but not for me, and a quail egg in bacon, which I'll most certainly get next time. It might seem like an odd thing for a restaurant with so much sushi, but the savory combination of flavors in that dish was umami at its finest. I'm already looking forward to coming back!"
"5.0","Absolutely terrific food and service. General Tso's tofu is out of this world, but so is every dish we have ever ordered from here. If we didn't move out of town, this place would see us every week."

Yes, P-Bros is an Experience, and my life is greatly improved for having had said experience. But when it comes to the better corn beef on rye, it's Sammy's hands down.The quality of the ingredients was off the charts good. Even the pickle on the side was unbelievable--and from the same local producer since Sam first opened up shop 31 years ago.Its exactly what you want in a neighborhood bar, down to the neon signs in the window, the nostalgic mix of old timey black and white regional photos and Penguins and Steelers memorabilia plastered across the walls every 3 inches, and complete with the aloof but still affable owner, counting money and slinging beers behind the bar.tl;dr: I highly recommend anything that comes with a pickle."
"5.0","Food AND Service was outstanding!  Had a business lunch here and while it's not the traditional restaurant (you order/pay first then they deliver your order), I'll certainly return.  Bravo Management and the greeter and cashier were very welcoming and cordial...great job!!!  I asked for a sandwich recommendation and the Italian Roast Beef is the employee favorite and now it's mine as well!"
"3.0","Bucket specials all day every day...except on game days? How is that even a thing. Awesome spot shitty 'specials' and service. Took 20 mins just to get a drink. Not even busy bartender only focused on one corner of that bar"
"4.0","I ordered a deluxe steak hoagie but somehow ended up with a club deluxe which I didn't notice until I bit into it. They made me a new steak deluxe and it was so good! Great tasting steak, cheese and mushrooms, onions, hot pepper. I would happily buy again."
"4.0","The blueberry ricotta pancakes will change your life. Best ever. We also ordered a BLT that my friend said was great, an omelet, and French toast. All were fantastic. The only thing I didn't love was having to get our own beverages. I had my hands full and would prefer to have someone do that and offer refills. Great place and nice staff"
"4.0","I've eaten here the last couple of days for breakfast. This is the first time I have eaten here since it opened, just because of their 9 to 3 hours (and I can't seem to get there on Saturdays), even though it is pretty much around the corner from where I live. The food was great, I had the egg white sandwich with avocado yesterday and the red beans and rice this morning. Both were absolutely great tasting. My girlfriend went with me yesterday and seemed to really enjoy her turkey sandwich. The only tiniest of caveats, the food took a while to get to me/us both days. More time than I might have expected. And second, the red beans and rice was advertised as coming with cornbread. Instead I got a lot of potato (a little pile of fingerling and a half a russet). After having gotten the plate, I asked one of the employees. She said they did not have the cornbread. Well, the person taking my order might have said something, the person (the same one I asked) setting the plate down might have said something and the red bean dish is on a white board, so the cornbread could have been excised easily from the board. But I am very impressed with the number of vegetarian, vegan and gluten free offerings."
"5.0","Found this place using Yelp and I'm glad I did. This restaurant has an amazing brunch and there is a great atmosphere. Staff is great, and the food is amazing. They have a huge selection of crepes and omelettes. You have to try the mocha french toast and the protein omelette. Everything about this place was fun and I definitely recommend checking it out. It's basically right across the street from UPMC Children's Hospital and street parking is easy here."
"1.0","Ordered online for '45 minute' delivery.  Called after waiting an hour and a half and they didnt even have my order.  At that point no other options were open.  Absolute sh*t service.  Was hoping to get first meal in 12 hours after an emergency delivery while with my new daughter in NICU, instead tried to sleep hungary and exhausted, they didn't seem to care."
"1.0","They made me cry on my birthday! They didn't tell me that there is an hour limit when I made reservations, but kicked us out even when my guests weren't done with their food. They didn't even bring food for one of my guests! Awful service and rude manager!"
"5.0","The 'damn hot' chicken sandwich was brutally satisfying--big, meaty, balanced, and good for punishing yourself for whatever went wrong that day. The cole slaw is vinegar based and the fries are crinkled and seasoned. As a bonus, this place has an actual bar with both liquor and beer."
"5.0","The food here is amazing. Excellent service and very friendly staff. Highly recommend this place. It's the best food I have had in Pittsburgh."
"5.0","Long overdue but want to give a shout out to George, our server, who went above and beyond with our service when we were in town visiting in March. We had only planned on grabbing a drink and appetizer and ended up staying for dinner.  He was so friendly and helpful, giving particular attention to my son's food allergies. Thanks for making our night great!"
"3.0","I dreaded the wait for this place. They don't take reservations & no call ahead. It was already off to a bad start with the host giving incorrect information of where to add my name to the wait list.Quite frankly, I think the TV to dining table ratio is way off here. Sooo many TVs but there didn't seem to be much of a dining area. Also, the other half (the Bettis fan & the only reason we were here) expected to see more Bettis memorabilia.  The only saving grace was that my Steak Penne Gorgonzola was pretty good. No leftovers if that says anything - and I almost always have leftovers. If you feel claustrophobic in the overcrowded bar area just head outside to the patio but be forewarned that it's pretty loud there too. I guess it's ok if you just want to watch the game and not talk to anyone that you're hanging out with."
"5.0","I have loved Luke's since the first time I set foot in the door back in 2013 [yea I was late to the game] so I am excited to finally review the place.For all Pittsburghers the name Wholey is automatically associated with high quality Seafood, so Luke had some big shoes to fill when he opened it back in 2012. Nestled on the corner of 21st street the first thing that you come across is an inviting outdoor patio with a few tables and an outdoor oyster bar. Pick your favorites fresh on ice. The outdoor seating is actually a walk in by opening the garage style door so it's easy to walk inside and out without having to go around the ropes from Penn Avenue. Definitely give this a try on a cool summer evening in August and sunny Saturday's during Spring and Fall. Oh and did I mention they have a DJ on When you walk in the door the first thing that you noticed is the decor. Every wall is filled with Mural [My favorite is Cali's clown fish - painted by a local artist] off Fish or decorated with over-sized swordfish replica. The back wall behind the pillar has a mid-sized aquarium with live fish. [There were rumors on having a shark in there once]. The main room has round table seating with tables made of giant spools similar to the ones you can find on a boat. Off to the right side of the restaurant is a large bar where one of their excellent bartenders will make you anything your heart desires, whether a regular vodka soda, to super strong long island iced teas or warming hot toddies [I had a terrible cold and no voice the first time I came here - instant love]. Usually I get a standard Pinot Grigio [I am so common] Making your way to the back the upstairs divides itself into a private lounge and a Loft lounge. The upstairs will have Hightops and you can peer over the balcony over the rest of the restaurant. The private lounge is perfect for any company dinner all you have to do is watch out for the stuffed brown bear.Now to the actual point -- the Food!Because I am an appetizer junky we shall start there: You cannot go wrong with the Lobster Bisque. It is thick and buttery with a generous helping of actual lobster rather than just the flavor or the shreds I have gotten in many Bisques elsewhere. This bisque has spoiled me by far - my favorite ever. The coloring is on the darker brown end to me that just means heartiness. Btw - you can get this at the Wholey's grocery store as well and you will not be disappointed. Luke's serves this in a Yinzer version - which means there are Lobster bisque fries. [that's a little much for me].The catfish bites are delectable, light and fluffy. Little breading and a chili sauce to dunk it in, same thing with the calamari [just basil marinara rather than chili]. Speaking of some spice - I recently shared the mussels and they are just the treat. Beware of the portion though, this could definitely be a meal just for yourself, so get this when you are sharing. I personally do not like Oysters so I take this from a friend's review: You get a lot of them as a variety from both Atlantic and Pacific. In the summer they even serve them over ice outside. [naturally when the sun isn't shining directly on them]For entrees the same goes as the appetizers. Large portions of delicious on delicious. Because of my stuffing with apps, my boy and I shared the Fish and Chips Platter with Scallops and Jumbo Shrimp. No disappointment here, the breading was light, the portion generous and the scallops so soft. you can never go wrong with Wholey's scallops, whether eating out or at home dinner party as Wine and Cheese share-ables. While we did not have it the crab stuff salmon walked by our table and smelled amazing. I can't wait to go back and try it.As Luke has fish in his blood you will get daily specials on a regular basis, when he has awesome catches they usually end right on the menu as a taco or lightly fried up bites. If you see him, he will gush you into trying everything.Other things to mention: Have an event here! I personally have hosted 3 of them now [2 for my CMU MBAs and 1 for the Pittsburgh Happy Hour Annual Party] and Jason the Manager is so helpful and easy to deal with. I continue to overwhelm him with an eating bunch and despite running our waiters ragged, everybody was beyond pleased. Be sure to be considerate for both the holiday season and the Wholey's Annual party in the Summer so plan ahead. The staff is more than helpful.Make sure to ask about the rewards points. Yup - a restaurant with rewards points. Every $200 you get $20 credited so you can come back and enjoy again. Oh - make sure to register it so you protect your balance. I recently lost mine [upset!] so don't do what I did. Love this place and need to rush back soon to try again."
"4.0","Went to Rialto on a trip to Pitt with friends. Ordered a Pierogi Pizza and a Gyro Pizza. The Pierogi pizza was pretty good. The Gyro pizza though? FANTASTIC! Definitely should give that a try. I was a little unsure about it before trying it but once I did, I was sold. Price was in line with what you'd expect from a pizza joint."
"4.0","Like any upscale restaurant, this place was very well decorated and gave you the feeling that you're going to have an expensive meal. Although the prices were not outrageous, it's quite pricey for a sirloin salad that comes with four small pieces of steak. I did like the bread that they brought out and the corn chowder was very creamy and delicious. I ordered the steak salad which to my surprise only had four pieces of meat. However, it was a good salad and I would order it again. Bon appetit!"
"1.0","5:15 reservation they sat us at 6:15. We were six people who were sat at a four top. My chair was touching the chair of the person behind me so no one could get by. The waiter asked me to get up and move so he could get by, what???  So when I sat sideways against the wall (due to no moving room) he said thank you. Not okay. There was an elderly man who needed a seat and went roaming into the coat room in desperation for a chair because he was standing for 30 minutes waiting for a table that he made a reservation for. No one noticed so I went into the coat room myself (as a customer) to bring him a chair so he didn't fall down. After asking ourselves to be sat at a table where we weren't being hit by customers and waiters, we were moved to a regular table. Then our food was an hour late because the kitchen 'made a mistake' on roasted chicken. (?)If you want an anxiety free calm place that gives attention to comfort, this restaurant may not be for you."
"5.0","Best sushi I've had in while! Ordered the toro tuna which was super fresh. Also loved the shumai and 'family recipe' pudding. Service was great too. So glad I didn't order room service after a long day of work."
"4.0","Came here with my in-laws over the weekend and enjoyed our experience.  Got the impression they were short-staffed with a party upstairs and a full dining room.  We enjoyed the Smoked Gouda as an appetizer as well as the beet side salad.  I had the crab cakes with risotto and enjoyed it.  Love that this spot is BYOB!"
"4.0","This first visit was very enjoyable...great food and didn't feel rushed at all, waiter was knowledgable and pleasant.  I like the simple one page menu and that they use good quality ingredients, starting with the white bean/balsamic spread, fresh baked bread & house salads.  We had the smoked gouda appetizer recommended by our waiter - delicious!  and wild mushroom bisque - just good. Her pork chop entree was fantastic, best I ever tasted...my shrimp pasta entree was good; cooked perfect but under seasoned.  Definately worth a repeat visit to explore other menu items.  Good job to everyone!"
"5.0","This was a great little breakfast place. The coffee was delicious and those pastries were amazing! I had the latte and the quiche (with bacon). The pastry was flaky and the quiche was very flavorful. I would love to come eat lunch here the sandwiches were made fresh daily and they also have soups."
"5.0","The Food is excellent you know that because there's a line every time I'm their. I always get the lamb rice and spinach it's about $11 but you get a huge portion the nice thing is there's plenty of seating and TVs so you can watch sports. Also there's a market attached for uncooked items to take home."
"4.0","Well, well... I thought I knew what a good cheesecake was. It was quite wonderful to be proven wrong.That aside, lovely ambiance, a professional and courteous staff, delicious food that not only didn't disappoint, but went above and beyond my expectations. I'll make a very minor complaint and note that there was a bit of banging noise by where I was seated, probably coming from the kitchen-- it wasn't terribly loud so it didn't bother me much, though it was fairly consistent throughout the meal. Other than that bit of nitpicking, though... I can't think of a reason I wouldn't return."
"4.0","Been here multiple times and I am a big fan. They offer a variety of italian foods and you cannot go wrong. A must order is the smoked Gouda - MUST! Last trip, I had the new york strip with Kale mashed potatoes. You get a salad with your meal and it is pretty tasty! The owner is great and the service is usually good! However on my last visit, right at closing time the server turned off the music and the lights on full blast. It was very awkward as there was also another table which was large party in the room. They had just cleared our plates too. I have been in the restaurant industry so I know what its like when tables just chill and its closing time but that was not the way to go about it and it was 10 mins past 9:15. I brought 3 friends of mine who had never been there and I felt embarrassed. I won't not come back because of it though (unless happens again :/ ).They also do awesome catering."
"5.0","Had one of their burgers as a slider at the Big Pour and was seriously impressed. So when Church Brew Works was closed on a Friday evening, I was excited to find that Cinderlands was not far away. The Diner Burger in the restaurant was a delicious notch above the slider. With bacon, cheese, and an added egg, it was just the right amount of messy and full delicious. My only criticism would be that I would have rather it had a slightly larger, single patty instead of two smaller ones. But, that is just personal preference. This burger is absolutely worthwhile."
"1.0","I have been gong there for many years. Always loved it. However the last three times have been a big disappointment. The quality of the food has deteriorated and is totally tasteless."
"5.0","Even though this place is located in a very unassuming place inside a small mall, this place delivers on awesome food.  This authentically run Japanese restaurant produces some of the most amazing, quality foods.  I've been to some of the best Japanese restaurants in places like NYC and California.  Even though you can argue there's some artistic element that's unique to these higher echelon restaurants, I can still safely say this place had the best Toro Tuna I've had in a very long time.  Although each fish may differ by the season, my experience at this restaurants tells me that this restaurants cares about the quality of their product, and does their best to deliver delicious food."
"1.0","Just finished a very disappointing brunch here. We were seated right away but then waited 5 minutes for menus and water. We had to flag down the waiter to order. We ordered 2 plain crepes for our 3 year old, a Cobb salad for me and a buffalo chicken crepe with a salad for my husband. I asked for strawberries on the side for the crepes and was happy to see avocado on the Cobb salad description. I ordered a $3 ice tea. Our food was brought in a short amount of time. The plain crepes arrived as French toast. The Cobb salad was lacking avocado and had gross turkey deli meat laid over the top. I instantly recognized it from Costco. I dug into the salad and found the avocado.... dollops of Costco guacamole. I tried to eat around it but it was smeared on all the half wilted greens. My husband's crepe was fine. The salad was just greens and vinaigrette. My daughter's erred French toast was fine but not worth the cost of the meal. My ice tea was never refilled, no one checked on our meals, and the bill was $50. What a waste."
"3.0","Food is ok.. Nothing special bar food. But the service is honestly shitty.... We waited 10 minutes to be greeted my a server, who was standing around the bar talking. It was not busy. This was our 3rd visit. And each time the service was terrible. We keep trying this place and get disappointed each time. :( prob won't be back again after this time."
"5.0","OMG THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! Okay, the ambiance is cutesy and romantic. Upon arrival you are given a bread basket with HUGE Texas sized bread. I wasn't such a big fan because it was so soft that it seems to deteriorate while holding it. Little too messy for my liking. The bruschetta was not your typical bruschetta and honestly I would not recommend it. The Caesar salad is really a pity. Although it looks like a Caesar salad it doesn't taste like one since the lettuce, croutons, and dressing are all so flimsy. It hardly tasted like anything. So why am I giving this place a 5 star review? Because the pasta is amazing! The best pasta I have ever had! Now I know why people with Italian mothers/grandmothers scoff at places like Olive Garden where they don't make their own noodles. What a difference it makes. The menu offers you a large selection of noodles (gluten free available) and sauces to choose from. I had the marfredo (mix of marinara and alfredo) and I was dying over how good it was. My girlfriend, who has an Italian family, had the aglio aoli (sp?) and she was also dying over how amazing this was. DO COME HERE but don't waste any of your time with the appetizers or bread. Save your appetite for the pasta! I didn't get to try the deserts but next time I want to try their tiramisu since all the deserts are also made on site."
"5.0","My second visit to Cafe Raymond was just as wonderful as our first.  The food is fresh and delicious.  The staff, friendly and attentive.  I had salad on both visits, this time, my son had a burger.  The burger was enough for two people.  I wish they were open for the dinner hour."
"4.0","They once held witch trials here, but they have hypocritically changed their tune to that peace-and-love tree hugging stuff now. How picky and choosy of them.I have been wanting to check out Salem's for a very long time. For one reason or another, it took me until this past summer to have the chance to do so. I'd give it 5 stars for their wonderful peaceful murals and four stars for their good prices. However the food itself is pretty average and tasted somewhere in the region of three star quality. So it averages out to Cuatro, but I probably won't make a habit of coming back here too often. I'll need one more trip, though, to try out some of the dishes I missed, in case I missed a gem. So, much like my gf, it's huge inside and they have lots of Middle Eastern food options, so give it a try if you love this type of Cuisine and maybe you will enjoy it."
"5.0","Good tacos the specials are great but have to get one before they run out.  I do miss the avocado slice that used to come on the pollo but solid taco place."
"5.0","My most recent visit here was to celebrate V Day. I was given a choice of my favorite restaurant and this is it.Reservations were made for 8pm and we were seated in a good spot to catch action on the TV while we talked and ate. Our server was the same gal that served for my bday party. Her name slips my mind but she's really sweet. She ran through the specials and then left us to decide. I chose the baja shrimp and day boat scallops which is served with rice, asparagus and choice of sauce. I chose the lobster buerre crack, ummm I mean blanc. Lol it's very good.  The scallops and shrimp were cooked perfectly!!! The rice was a great accompaniment and the asparagus had a yummy char on it.  My valentine had the stuffed salmon. He really enjoyed his meal as well as 1 of the shrimp I was willing to part with. Unlike the seafood chains, the food is seasoned well here and not overly salted. The meals are very filling so there wasn't room for dessert but whatever dessert they were flaming by the bar looked really good.I've been to many seafood restaurants around here as well as ocean front spots and this place is above average. From the apps to the sushi to the entrees....you can't go wrong with the fresh fish and creativity that's served up here."
"2.0","I've pretty much given up any hope of having decent service here. No matter the day of week of level of 'busy' they are, it's slow and unreliable.  The food is decent and the hostesses are always nice/personable, but multiple different servers are just not that great.  I guess it's a non-issue since options to eat at the casino are limited by nature, but a smile and promptness go a long way."
"5.0","I always make sure I have cash to stop at Edgar's for a burrito when I'm in the Strip. I keep meaning to try their tamales but always end up getting the chicken burrito. Edgar and his tacos are just fantastic."
"3.0","This place makes me want to wave the Terrible Towel...at the 1 and 2 star Chinese restaurants in California. Woot!I stumbled upon this restaurant during my walk around Downtown Pittsburgh. The building was quite striking and hard to miss. Even the next day some kids riding in my shuttle bus pointed to that restaurant from afar, mistaking it as a tourist destination. The divided interior was just as elaborated with Chinese red colored from wall to wall. I came at the height of their lunch hour. It was a packed house but I still find myself the only Asian person in a venue where chopsticks had to take a backseat to forks and knives. The overtone of traditional aesthetics, English-only menu, and western utensils rendered my assumptions about this place, but relatively speaking this place was also to closest to what I see on Broadway in LA or Grant in SF. With $8.51 (w/tax), I opted for their lunch special combination with Szechuan shrimps and scallops with steamed rice. The dish came with a choice of soup and my bowl of decent won tons was comforting with strings of barbeque pork. After extended wait time, my dish came with a decent portion of jumbo shrimps and scallops stir fried with bell peppers, broccoli, baby corns, water chestnuts, and carrots in a brown savory sauce. The sauce reminded me of those cold winter days eating in Boston Chinatown while the combination was fresh with scallops being my favorite. For the price, it was certainly a better meal than any place named Panda. In terms of authenticity however, this place is far from Szechuan cuisine as the typical liberal applications of chili and garlic were desperately missing in the culinary discourse. Toned down Americanized and purposely catered to their mainstream clientele, 3 stars for the passable experience."
"4.0","My mom's from Philly, and our standards for a cheesesteak are pretty high. They were met here! This is a yummy divey kinda place where you order at the counter, and your food is brought to you. The bread is great, and the quality of the meats is good as well.The decor is really what kept me smiling here. Lots of vintage sports items, photos, and a ton of old Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head dolls! My family was entertained. They also play a great mix of old (Ray Charles) and new-ish (Green Day) music and it all flows together so nicely. We had family members ranging from ages 20-60 and everyone found themselves bobbing and singing along at some point. This was an enjoyable place, and if I'm on the strip again, I'm definitely stopping in!"
"5.0","A Pittsburgh tradition! Pamela's is the perfect place for a quick and cheap breakfast any day of the week with classics such as waffles, crepes, omelettes, and pancakes. The menu also offers lunch sandwiches, salads, and burgers. On weekends expect there to be a line or wait as they fill up quickly, but once you place your order the food usually doesn't take much longer than 5-10 minutes. The atmosphere is like a usual diner, quick, family friendly, old school music, checkerboard tile, and delicious smells from the kitchen! Heads up--they only accept cash so don't forget to run to the ATM!"
"5.0","Typically, aesthetics play a huge part in deciding how much I like a restaurant. I'm looking for the full package: is it unique, does it look cool, does it taste good, is there good service, was the wait long, is the staff helpful, how is the price?But genuinely, when it comes to Salem's, the food is just so stinking good that it gets a 5 stars just for that! The rest is just a blip on the radar (though I WOULD like to highlight that it's very affordable and the staff is SO friendly and helpful). You will never find a chicken tikka masala that tastes as good as Salem's. I've actually tried and nothing compares. So much so that I can no longer order chicken tikka masala anyway because I will just be disappointed. Is it aesthetically pleasing inside? Not really, it looks like a cafeteria. On top of that, at peak hours it can be really difficult to find parking. But I don't even mind. The perfect lunch spot. And an instant win when bringing friends and introducing them to a new cuisine."
"3.0","I went to Sausalido with a friend on a Groupon. It was a Tues evening and the restaurant was not busy. We received great attentive service from our server. Our appetizer (goat cheese portabella), salad, and bread with the hummus dip were all great. We ordered the roasted seafood risotto special and that's where Sausalido lost a few points. The dish was quite bland with little substance in terms of seasoning. When my friend and I had our first bite, we both reached for the salt shaker. I will definitely give Sausalido another try, but will go for a different main dish."
"5.0","I finally was on that side of town and made it in to see Maria.  Holy Cow, what took me so long?!?!  I love this place!  As soon as you walk in you feel like family.  The shop is full of cute and decorative gifts and trinkets.  There are so many to look through, and all are adorable and special.  I did resist doing some early x-mas shopping, but I will be back in the fall!  Now my favorite part is all the specialty Italian items that she has!!  There is double 00 flour, which is amazing!  Swing by and get some!  You will love it!  It is for pasta, bread and crusts and you will wonder how you baked without it for so long.  I also found some wonderful olive oil, and sea salt.  Perfect for dipping bread or finishing a salad.  YUM!There are lots of great cook books and kitchen gadgets too!  Maria is right there to tell you her favs and help you with whatever you need.Now, the best part.....she has a kitchen in the back of the store and is baking fresh cookies, biscotti, gnocchi,  and cooking meatballs.  She sells them right there in store and if you can resist, you are a better person than I am!  (The peanut butter with the chocolate are amazing!)Love Love Love!"
"5.0","This is the first time my friend and I ordered from this restaurant!It was DELICIOUS!We both had the seafood salad!OMG! Fresh greens, cherry tomatoes, crab, shrimp,and mozzarella cheese! YUMMY!Choice of garlic bread or croutons!We also had the cannoli for dessert! Double YUMMY!!!We will be ordering from them again!!!"
"4.0","Tried this place based on Yelp reviews for a recent lunch.  We decided to try both the Chicago style and regular pizzas.  I will say both of these pizzas were very good.  Delivery was fast and the pizza arrived hot.  Will definitely be back."
"4.0","Fantastic fast paced shwarma place. The food over all was really good with lots of a la cart options. In particular the fried kibbee was some of the best I've had and I've had many. Not much ambience,  kind of a high school cafeteria feel. But the food was outstanding."
"5.0","Really great chicken for a decent price."
"4.0","The food is incredible. I ordered garlic naan, a mango lassi, and lamb vindaloo--the best I have ever had. Staff were concerned when I asked for the vindaloo to be prepared extra spicy, but after a little well-intentioned debate she acquiesced to my request. I was incredibly satisfied. The flavors and spiciness were in perfect balance. Few of the Indian restaurants I have frequented are bold enough to meet my capsaicin requests. However, I am confident that anyone even after a little finagling could find the perfect balance of spice to suite their palate.The staff do seem to be a tad confused however. The garlic naan I ordered, which I had asked to be served as an appetizer appeared after my vindaloo, and only after I had asked about it. The food served to my friends had already arrived. Nonetheless, if the communication among the staff were improved, this would be a 5-star establishment!"
"5.0","We go here any time that we are in this area. My kids look forward to doc appointments at Childrens so we can stop here . Their fries are fresh cut cooked well and I love the cheese steaks . No grease at all. They also have a great staff."
"3.0","You know it's not great when you mention that your seafood is chewy to your waitress and she does nothing. I ordered the appetizer combo which is a baby octopus salad, squid salad and seaweed salad. The baby octopus and squid salad were relatable to a nicer Chinese buffet; while edible, not at all what you'd expect from a restaurant specializing in seafood. When ordering, I asked if the seafood was fresh. She confirmed it was and when we inquired about the Wholey name she said they were not affliliated but their seafood was fresher than the market. The first time I mentioned the overly chewy seafood, the waitress simply said she doesn't eat anything like that so she doesn't know what it should taste like. The 2nd time I mentioned, she didn't react at all. My boyfriend had a softshell crab sandwich and it was good. That's why they get 3 stars."
"5.0","I have legit been waiting for years to eat at Pamela's. So when I finally found a weekend in Pittsburgh to visit, I was sure that it wasn't going to live up to my expectations.Wrong. Highlights:-The pancakes are definitely more like cr√™pes than pancakes, which is a good thing. They're served rolled rather than flat with whipped cream and/or fruit and/or other toppings.-Home fries were fantastic! I get the feeling they may have been baked rather than fried, because they were sort of mushy instead of crispy, but no complaints.-$6.50 for an order of pancakes? I forget how cheap everything in Pittsburgh is. If I didn't have enough of a good experience to put me to five stars before, I reached that point when I saw the bill.Go. Just go. Don't ask questions."
"1.0","The food is good and seems a lot better for you than the typical fast food. Problem with this freshii is that they get a lot of orders wrong. If you notice before you leave they tend to give you a 10% off voucher for your next meal. But most of the time I order out and it's not always easy to tell if something is buried underneath the pile. It's very frustrating to arrive home without a key ingredient. In response to owners response: yes it is the Pittsburgh union trust freshii. Yes I still have one of the 10 percent off coupons I received when I pointed out an error - I didn't say it was your policy only that the employees have done that a few times. And yes, thank you for denigrating my review - I'm not sure why I'm surprised though... denial of the problem is typical of places that offer poor service."
"5.0","After tromping the grounds of Downtown Pittsburgh (including Market Square, Point State Park featuring Fort Pitt, and a search for the Riverboat Tour) on a remarkably humid Tuesday morning, we looked along Penn Avenue for something to eat. After passing an endless array of fast food joints and businessman-only haunts, we came across Redbeard's, which seemed to target us a bit better. Two words on the menu indicated to me we had made the right decision: Italian Quesadilla, which was as good and interesting as it sounds. Wife had a hamburger and fries, and combined with our drinks, found that we really didn't need to eat for the rest of the day, yet at the same time the meal didn't exhaust us."
"5.0","Price was fair for being a restaurant with great sushi. The vibe was hip and even saw some interesting 'floor' seating. We definitely would go back to try other things on the menu. Even being a vegetarian I had a ton of options and left feeling full. One thing I enjoyed the most was the different sake options and it was affordable to try two different types."
"3.0","Umami has such a cool vibe that's perfect for an intimate date night or drinks with your girlfriends. My review pertains to a recent trip for the former. This seems to be one of the harder spots in town to snag a reservation, so I was pleasantly surprised when we walked in sans-reso at 7:00 PM on a Wednesday and got a table right away. For starters, we tried the Japanese fried chicken. I loved the spicy kewpie mayo that accompanied it, but the breading was thick and a bit dry for my liking. Next up was the Okonomiyaki. I've been dying to try one of these since I saw a Buzzfeed Tasty video about it two-ish years ago.  Once you get over being mesmerized by the bonito flakes dancing on top, underneath is a thick cabbage and corn 'pancake' topped with a couple of different sauces. We opted to omit the bacon from ours and while the flavors of the inside of the pancake were good, the heavy saucing made for a very rich dish that we couldn't finish. Finally, we split the Zaru Soba - cold soba noodles with a grilled salmon skewer. I really liked this dish and dipping everything in the ponzu sauce that accompanied it. I'd probably order this again, though I wouldn't recommend it for sharing simply because it's on the smaller side. Overall this was a decent dining experience and the service was great. There wasn't anything wrong with our meal, but it was just 'ok.'  I'll likely be back to try other things like their sushi or various ramen offerings."
"5.0","Tamarind has a really great vibe! In particular I enjoyed that the setting was in a house! It was like eating iman intimate setting. I also loved the paintings of flowers on the wall. The staff was very kind and split our food as we requested. Favourite dishes were the dal and the chicken makhani. I would definitely come back. Finally, the deals were great, especially the buy one entree and get a second one 50% off"
"4.0","Thai Gourmet is a very cute, family-owned restaurant. There's lots of decorations throughout the restaurant but it's not gaudy. Overall a nice, clean space. Service is friendly and very, very fast!Food is pretty good. I've gotten take-out a couple times and been pretty satisfied each time. The Panang curry has a nice flavor and pad thai is pretty good. Portions are pretty large. Overall, I'm quite happy to order from this restaurant."
"5.0","I love the new location! They were very busy (understandably) on Black Friday at 10am but after a short wait in the counter line we were seated upstairs and received our food after just a few minutes. We were all hungry so we ordered a piece of fig baklava from the counter to share before our meals arrived. The flavor was amazing! The piece was big enough for four of us to all enjoy.Food: - The Turkey Club: Fantastic! The bacon was cooked perfectly and the turkey was fresh. I was a big fan! - The Burger: My sister reported that it had the best pickles ever - and was cooked to perfection.Helpful hints: upstairs seating is more spacious, there are water pitchers on both the first and second floors, the baklava makes a great appetizer!I'll see you soon, Raymond... I'll see you soon."
"5.0","The blueberry hotcakes were unbelievable! The lyonnaise potatoes were also delicious. Definitely worth the wait."
"4.0","Solid Pizza at a fair price.I get this for work a lot and have found the quality to be consistent.  It's not the greatest pie ever but for the price it's good and the pies area good size."
"3.0","My first time at a Hardee's and I have mixed feelings. I think I had the original thick burger. It was tasty! Perfect ratios of toppings and the patty was great. I got regular fries but I wish I had gotten the curly fries. Two complaints: 1. Hard to eat the burger, it was kind of falling apart because of how they set it down in the box after they assembled it and 2. that my burger was kind of sweet, which I was not crazy about. I'm not sure if it was the pickles, or one of the sauces on it, or what, but it really brought the experience down a few notches. I would probably return to try the chicken or maybe another burger that I will hopefully like better. Until then, my review stays at 3 stars."
"4.0","I'll start by saying I lived in walking distance of Umami and also I was in the habit of grabbing a late night bite when I was eating there frequently. There aren't many kitchens open as late but out of the few there are, Umami was by far my go-to in the Lawrenceville neighborhood. They had a DJ on the nights I was there making it feel lively and the red lighting makes it feel like club atmosphere. I think you might have to have a man-bun to be a server there. My favorite spot to sit is at the sushi bar where it's like watching art being made one order after another. The small plate options make it easy to try different items until you reach your fill. Reservations are recommended at prime times."
"3.0","I thought my dish 'bay scallop risotto' was bland and average.  But my friends who ordered other items like the crab cakes thought it was great so I will refrain from a 2 star rating.   Bottom line -  just order something besides the bay scallop risotto and you should be good."
"5.0","I enjoy all of the levels of Sienna Mercado, but my love of grazing on cheese makes me a dedicated fan of Mezzo.On one particular visit with a friend, we ordered a charcuterie board and mushroom pizza to share (paired with a couple glasses of wine a piece). Everything was delicious and the charcuterie was varied and we'll paired with the cheeses."
"5.0","This was a great choice. We were greeted by Melissa when we walked in. She was our server as well. She was fantastic! She had her hands full for the evening but she did not disappoint. The food was great and the atmosphere was awesome! We will return for sure."
"4.0","Caught this truck at the Bakery Square beach event this past weekend and I got the Bulgogi bowl with everything on it! I have to say that the Bulgogi tastes pretty close to my mom's which I was super surprised about, it was delicious. The little dumplings were so cute and tasty. There's a ton of veggies and rice, which was a little disappointing for me because they don't give you that much meat... but at least it tasted good. I think for the large rice: meat ratio, $10 is pretty pricey, but the flavors were definitely there."
"5.0","My boyfriend and I have went here for drinks several times but just recently tried their food.  I have always enjoyed their beer and cocktails, everything has been great!  For food, I ordered the burger and my boyfriend order a shrimp sandwich which kind of reminded him of a po boy.  We both loved our food!  The burger was one of the better burgers I've had in town and the fries were very good as well.  The service was great, the server was very accommodating to us being picky and asking for us substitutions for things. The ambiance is casual and and maybe you would call it the farmhouse look?  I enjoyed it.  We will definitely be back for food and drinks, can't wait to try their new location!"
"5.0","Everyone in town raves about Primanti's. However, this has to be my more favorite place to stop while in Pittsburgh. They have an awesome menu (cash only) but you cannot leave and not get the Roethli'burger'. Delicious. Yum. Heck to the yes. I love the small kitchen style atmosphere, and they love it when you tip. I mean, they go nuts when you do (Ala Cold Stone singing style nuts). Great people, even better food. Come hungry!"
"5.0","Staying at the Districk hotel cross the street, it's super convenient. Sunday evening at 8pm, just wanted something light to eat, thank goodness this place was open! All I wanted is a large bowl of wonton soup, and it was ready in like 5 mins. The staff there was very friendly as well."
"5.0","My wife & I have been wanting to come here for years and we finally made a reservation and went, one word to describe it is WOW!  This is fine dining like you see in the movies or on television shows.  Our waiter was so friendly and took care of all of our needs.  The steak here was one of the best that I've ever eaten in the Pittsburgh area."
"4.0","I had no idea what to eat for lunch one day.  I didn't want any more pizza.  (We had a pizza party at work and they sent us home with leftover pizza.)  I also didn't want to eat a salad or anything remotely healthy that day.  So I wandered down to the Craftwork Kitchen spot under the USX tower.  A friend of mine recommended that I try almost any sandwich.  By the way, I'm a sucker for fresh-cut fries and when I saw that those were available, I thought that this might be the ticket.When I stepped up to the counter, I didn't expect mad jokes all around from the dudes there.  I like humor with my food.  They were friendly and very excited about the food that they were serving. How many restaurateurs do you meet that have that level of enthusiasm?I was in the mood for shrimp and they were in the mood to make me a Shrimp Po Boy.  I added some fresh-cut fries (I did say that I love fresh-cut fries) and I was ready to chow down.  I received my food quickly and trotted back to my desk for a feast.  Let me say this, the food was fresh tasting and you could tell that it was homemade.  I appreciate that. (So many restaurants open a jar of Marzettis and pour out whatever they offer.  Nothing against Marzettis,  I'm just saying to try making something from scratch)  The shrimp had a good flavor, the bread was dang tasty and the fries were scrumptious!  What's not to like?Since my initial trip, I have also tried their amazballs tacos and homemade watermelon 'juice'?  Mouthwatering all around!"
"4.0","First time at Salido food is great service was better Melissa was very attentive..will be back soon"
"5.0","Probably the great breakfast I have ever had in my entire life. My day is set here in Pittsburgh simply by stopping by at Pamela's. My Amazing uber driver recommended this place. He was legit. The beautiful girl who helped me gave me the greatest suggestions and I literally don't want to stop eating it. I got the mornin after breakfast special with the specialty hot cake! Oh my! You guys have no idea how amazing it is! The art work...:the art work is simply beautiful and fun and happy and just amazing. Come here! This place deserves 10 stars! They are simply amazing!"
"3.0","We decided to eat here based on previous Yelp reviews. I have to say I was a little disappointed. There is an awkward cafeteria-type bar set up with a separate coffee/drink bar to the right. A fair beverage warning: they do not serve regular soda, lemonade, or sweet tea at the Cafe Phipps. On the plus side you can get a beer. :-)I had a bowl of tomato basil soup that was fresh and delicious. It came withe some homemade breadsticks, also yummy. I also had a really decent cappuccino. So, while I though the cafe was fine, I just wish that it also catered to more plebian tastes like...Diet Coke."
"4.0","This place is such a hidden GEM! We try their restaurant week menu and a few other things on the regular menu. Everything was amazing! The seafood casserole was to die for. Their mushroom pasta was also very very delicious! Definitely looking forward to come back again and try out the other items."
"5.0","This is the perfect place to stop in for a quick bite or grab something to go. There isnt much room inside for seating so I wouldn't recommend bringing a large group. I ordered a black bean taco with cheese & crema & it was SO good.    The food tastes fresh & everything is put together right in front of you. I want to go back soon to try the loaded nachos because they looked amazing."
"5.0","Great sandwiches, fresh bread, and delicious desserts. Excellent espresso and the kids thought they made  great eggs."
"5.0","These tacos were sooooooooooo good. And the price was just right. Highly recommended. They do accept credit card, seating is minimal, do not go with a big group, or don't plan to eat inside. It's primarily some bar seating and maybe a few counter top seats away from the bar at the most, pretty compact environment. I don't care though because the tacos are yummy. They don't offer free water, so you gotta buy your drinks from their mini fridge. Parking in this entire area is awful, you'll have to use the side streets till you find a spot (doable) - this is expected for this part of town."
"4.0","I love a good lunch spot and this is a great one. Simple and starlight forward, we ordered and paid at the counter since all the tables were full and by the time we sat down our meal was delivered. We got drinks out of the cooler at the front of the restaurant and an extra bag of New Orleans chips as a side since they are a rarity to find in pgh. I've  had their catering on multiple occasions in the past but had never visited be cafe. This weekend we found ourselves in the strip looking for a good sandwich and I'm so glad we chose cafe Raymond. I had the turkey club which came with roasted potatoes, and it was great. The quantify and quality of my meal definitely met my expectations. The salads and baked goods also looked delicious as many people were eating both of them around me. I'm looking forward to the next time I stop in for a delicious meal."
"4.0","We ate here before the pirate game. The service by George was awesome. The food was good and the drinks were too"
"4.0","Sigh yet another place that I know I've reviewed. It's a small walk up bakery offering all of the goodness you can get at the Lawrenceville shop.Flour imported from France definitely makes the difference.One of my fave bakeries in the city."
"3.0","The food was very good. The service was incredibly slow and they were very confused. We were offered other tables appetizers twice and then had to ask for ours again after waiting nearly a half hour. We also sat outside and had a decent view of the river."
"4.0","I stopped here today for a quick healthy lunch. I remember eating at Freshii's when I visited Houston a few months ago and enjoyed it so i was excited to see this healthy alternative to fast food in Pittsburgh. I ordered the Fiesta wrap with falafel and really enjoyed it. I was thinking that it would be warm but was cold but it tasted great. Had veggies, black beans, avocado, corn and tomato and a cilantro lime dressing. Enough to be satisfied but not feel full and heavy. Can't wait to try some of the breakfast options I saw on the menu the next time I come here."
"5.0","My boyfriend and I came to the Capital Grille for restaurant week and it was FABULOUS. For $35.18 a person you got a choice of a soup or salad, for the second course steak, salmon or chicken, and then two desserts to choose from. I got the field green salad with parmesan vinaigrette, an 8oz filet mignon medium rare, and flourless chocolate espresso cake for dessert along with a cup of coffee ($4 extra).Let's just start by saying the parmesan vinaigrette was AMAZING, and the salad to dressing ratio was perfect. The vegetables and lettuce were fresh and crunchy as well.My steak was cooked perfectly, and had a delicious 'crust' on the bottom that had a delicious seasoning. The sides we were given were mashed potatoes and green beans with heirloom tomatoes. Both were delicious and my boyfriend and I finished both between the two of us. Finally, dessert. This was insane. The flourless chocolate espresso cake was extremely rich and decedent, and literally melted in your mouth. It was a smaller piece of 'cake' but with how rich it was, it was the perfect size. All in all, this was one of the best meals I have ever had, and the service was amazing, especially for a night as busy as restaurant week. Would recommend to anyone!!"
"3.0","To widen my Craig St. pizza horizons a bit, I decided to give Little Nipper's a try tonight, since I was in the mood for some take out.  When I walked in the door, I was immediately greeted by the guy behind the counter and a guy who I assume was the owner.  I asked him if they served pizza by the slice, and he said that indeed, they did, though they'd have to make a fresh pie.  I said, 'But I can still buy just a couple slices, right?', and he assured me that this was the case.  I told him that in that case, I'd have two slices of plain.  He told me it would take about ten minutes, so I went for a walk around the block.When I returned about ten min. later, the owner told me it'd be one more minute and I said that was fine, and that I'd wait.  At this point, another guy who I hadn't talked to before saw my CMU t-shirt and asked me if that was where I went to school.  I told him that I'm finished with school, and that I work as a researcher now.  He asked me what I research, and I told him, and he told me he thought my topic of research was really interesting, and proceeded to show me that he even knew a bit about it.  I was impressed, since most people walking around don't know much of anything about my topic of research (though many people find it interesting, nevertheless!).Anywho, I took my box of slices back to my apt., where I opened it.  The slices smelled and looked good, but they seemed a bit greasy, and the crust seemed a bit soft.  After dabbing off a bit of the grease and sprinkling on a bit of Italian seasoning, I proceeded to eat them.  As I predicted, the flavor was good--the sauce was a bit on the sweeter side, and the cheese was classic mozzarella--but the crust wasn't crispy.  So, while they were good, they don't beat out the crispy-crusted slices of Pizza Prima, my Craig St. pizza standby.  On the other hand, they're definitely better than chain pizza slices (Papa John's, Domino's, etc.).  So, if other places on Craig St. are closed and the hours are conducive to your needs, if you need delivery, or if you're in the area and you'd just like to try something new, I'd recommend giving it a try.  3.5 stars."
"4.0","I have been craving Indian food lately and when someone overheard me say that, they quickly recommended Prince of India. I was told they had a buffet and right then and there I knew this was going to be the place to satisfy my Indian food craving! I am by no means an Indian food conniseur, so I will not be able to go into strict detail about each item, but what I can do is tell you how delicious everything was and how great of service they had! The food was delicious, plentiful and hot. They had everything I wanted to satisfy my Indian food craving and some! There were items I never had before like these sweet little balls on the buffet that were to die for! The chicken was all cooked to perfection and the taste was just right. The food was definitely on the less spicy end but that was ok. My favorite part about the meal was the naan! We got garlic naan with our meal and it was hands down the best naan I have ever had! All in all I was debating between giving this place 4 or 5 stars. I usually keep the 5 star reviews for a knock your pants off type of meal and atmosphere so I went with 4. That doesn't mean this place wasn't amazing! For a $13 Indian buffet this is tough to beat. They also offer alcohol, desserts, student discounts and more! I will 100% be returning to Prince of India every time my Indian food cravings return!"
"4.0","Decent pizza, baked a conveyor-belt oven. Rarely have slices, just whole pies, and walk-ins aren't really welcome. Almost no sitting room, and the atmosphere isn't something you'd want to spend time in anyway. Staff always seems surprised and unready when I come to pick up my order."
"5.0","Great make your own pizza! I've been here 3 times and order something different each time. All the ingredients look fresh. The service can be hit or miss. It's really hot inside during the summer so it's hard to eat in. We normally walk down and back up the hill from work. It can get busy during lunch. I try to save half for the next day but that doesn't always happen! You get a pizza for only $8 with as many toppings as you like"
"4.0","Probably one of the best Indian food restaurants in the greater Pittsburgh area.  They have several locations (3 I think) and I have been to this one and the location in North Oakland, both are very, very good.  I prefer my food 'Indian' hot and my wife and kids prefer theirs at a level somewhere under -18 (hold the flavor, bland).  Both of our tastes are met here.  Love the Onion Nan and almost everything on the menu, but you have to try the Saag.Give them a try."
"4.0","I am a huge fan of the pizza here! Large portions at a cheap price. I usually order a small pizza for lunch, and the cheese is so gooey and delicious. I didn't rate them a 5, because the service here can be off."
"5.0","Let me just say this.  I ate so much I had to be rolled out. Yelp is making me write more. It was great. Clean and the team was great. Didn't try any deserts but got the combo app."
"5.0","Yum! I've been waiting to try this place. Finally Friday, me and the boyfriend came around 7:30pm. It was indeed a small place, but a very cute taco shop. we were pretty surprised how short the menu is, however, everything on the menu looks so appetizing to me. I ordered three diff tacos: daily special (pork, cucumber, hoisin sauce, and cilantro), pollo, and carne molida. Mmm my favorite one is probably the carne Molida because I'm a big fan of spicy food. The other two were very tasty as well. We sat at the bar to eat our tacos. At first we came in there aren't many people, about 4 people. However, there were only one guy making tacos. We had to wait awhile for him to take our orders. After we got our orders in, the food came pretty quickly. While we were eating, I found that many people come in and out very rapidly. A lot of people got to go tacos. The price is very reasonable. Overall, My stomach was very content :) We both love it and will definitely come back again."
"4.0","Just moved into the area and decided to try the Rialto House pizza to see what this place was all about. Was not disappointed. Order for pickup, ready in 15 minutes. We walked over and took a look at the beer selection. $12.99 for a 6 of Magic Hat, not bad. Walked the pizza and beer home and was very happy with the pair. It's your typical local pizza spot and I'm happy to say this is very good and will frequent it when I'm in the mood for a slice. Good service. Decent beer selection. And really tasty. Will put into rotation. 4/5 starsBuffalo Chicken Pizza was very good. It's like BC dip on a tasty crust with a few added chunks of chicken on top to boot. 4/5 stars"
"5.0","My boyfriend and I went to celebrate our anniversary there and it was absolutely perfect! It was our first time being there and the waiters and the hosts welcomed us as if they have known us forever. Our table was adorable with heart confetti and an anniversary card from the Capital Grille team. It was a night that we will never forget and not to mention the food was phenomenal! We will definitely be going back!"
"3.0","Solid burger...Solid staff...soft fries.It was still new when I went. Atmosphere is little cold and suburban shopping plaza'ish.Buuuut I have to say, best burger in Lawrenceville...so far."
"4.0","We came to the cute area not planning on eating here. The menu was very mediocre and read 'boring bar food.' But, we were sooo pleasantly surprised!!"
"3.0","Farewell lunch with the college daughter.  I had corned beef hash and Swiss omelet.  The corned beef was great and fresh.  Lyonaisse potatoes lived up to its reputation.  Hubby and youngest daughter got banana chocolate chip pancakes which were super sweet and  Crispy.  Oldest got blueberry pancakes.  It was filled with giant blueberries and brown sugar and had a slight saltiness to it. Yummy! Food came out fast tho our server never refilled our drinks despite us asking at the counter, hence the three stars instead of four."
"4.0","Pretty decent spot. Service is nice and options aren't bad. Being in Station Square it's a little out of the way of other nightlife. So you'll have drive or Uber/Lyft if you have night plans. Still worth a try!"
"5.0","Absolutely wonderful.  Expensive? Yes.  Worth it?  Yes.  Especially if you are celebrating any special occasion.  Our meal cost close to $200 for two of us with drinks and tip but we were given so many freebies and such great service it was well worth it!  Free appetizer, free glass of wine, free birthday dessert sampler AND two free glasses of champagne!   Plus the food was extraordinary and well worth the price.  The Chilean sea bass was so full of richness and flavor!  The lobster mac and cheese was amazingly tender and my boyfriends steak had not a single piece of fat or gristle.  Everything was lovely and delicious!"
"3.0","This is a great place if you are looking for something different in a bar.  I love the games you can play and the atmosphere is great, especially in the summer.However, the prices are crazy for the drinks they serve.  I was not impressed with any of mine and spent way more than expected.  The menu could also use some changes.  I get that they are doing 'different' type food, but put at least one normal bar type food on there."
"4.0","Doce got it right by appealing to the quick lunch crowd. Service is fast and the food is good. The price point is great at $3 for a freshly prepared signature taco. Food was always pretty good as far as the 10x's I had eaten there over the past 2 years, keep it up with the fresh ingredients."
"4.0","We rented out the top floor for a private party and the staff was fantastic. The food was great and the bartenders really took care of us. I would highly recommend the upstairs for a private event."
"4.0","Fun chicken joint to grab a quick bite. The chicken is perfectly crispy and the flavor is good. There are 5 spice levels to choose from. They suggested that the medium was more like a 'hot' so I went with medium.... It was a medium :) The fries were average (not hot and didn't love the seasoning) and the waffles were soggy (maybe I was just unlucky) Overall, good food! I wouldn't make a special trip to check it out, but definitely worth trying next time you are in the area."
"5.0","Awesome location and free parking! They also have a large isolated room that is excellent for studying.  I think this might be the same location as 3401 Blvd of the Allies."
"4.0","First time to visit this iconic downtown Pittsburgh restaurant in the former Chinatown section, having only done takeout previous times. A classic, with the decor and also the hospitality including the comp hot tea delivered after you sit down. The sauces don't seem to be the type loaded with corn starch as typical of many Chinese restaurants. Freshly made steamed, handrolled shrimp dumplings were perfect. Szechuan Chicken was great as well with crispy vegetables in a light sauce!"
"4.0","Great food, nice family atmosphere. Loved the mafalda madison."
"4.0","There were 4 of us seated in the upstairs section for a friend's birthday dinner. Our waitress was personable and frank, not awkward at all. I appreciate that in wait staff. The food took forever to come out, but our waitress warned us that the kitchen was backed up and she kept checking in to make sure our beers were filled. Speaking of the beers... delicious! I see some folks commenting here that there weren't enough IPAs on the list, and to that I say THANK GOD. Hop heads are ruining the beer scene in the US these days to the point that those are typically ALL you see on draft lists with a Miller Lite and a random stout thrown in.  The beers at Cinderlands were balanced, crisp, bright, and so easy to drink. The Blithering Hayseed was my favorite.My friends loved the pierogis and I had the brussel sprouts. They were done just right, the marcona almonds (one of my favorite things on the planet) were such a nice touch both with their buttery quality and crunch. I'll be back for both the beer and brussels!"
"5.0","This is as good as it gets. Showed up on Easter Sunday for breakfast. Coffee, feta spinach quiche /w deliciously seasoned potato wedges, hame and brie sandwich on italian bread. Oh, and one more thing, ricotta blueberry pancakes... The quiche crust has a sweetness, so if you're into savory / sweet combos. The quality of eggs and spinach used is up there. The ricotta pancakes were so good, I think its in the batter, who knows ? I've got a breakfast spot in Pittsburgh :=)"
"3.0","The food was okay. Ordered appetizers.  Fried meatball for one and it was not cooked. Raw . But I must say they did take it off the bill.  Red sause is chunks of tomatoes! !!  Flat bread pizza was very good.  Nothing more"
"5.0","Everything we eat was fresh and tasty! They have some wine and a few delicious brews from Peak Organic Brewery!"
"5.0","We went for breakfast only.  The food was fantastic.  Broccoli and cheddar omelette was exceptional and well prepared. Italian toast was fresh and delicious and warm when served.  My wife's corn beef hash was also excellent as was the bacon.  Made to order and delicious.  They also used real butter and cream for the coffee.  The servers were all clean, friendly, and had no visible tattoos which we appreciate in this day and age!  Excellent.  We rarely take the time to post a review."
"5.0","Probably one of the best meals that I have had in a long time.  Amazing Tuscan shrimp scampi with oil, garlic and lemon sauce.  Captain crunch roll was equally as good.  I can't wait to go back and to top it off our waiter, Nick was superb.  Swordfish = out of this world too."
"3.0","I should start my review by saying that being a vegetarian might not be fair to review this restaurant but in any case for fellow vegetarians, I was somewhat disappointed by lack of flavors in the food. The food lacked umami flavor! :-) service was nice and friendly and I had a very good sake. Another problem with the place was cleaning material with strong chemical odor which was being used constantly as we ate which is really not all that pleasant.  Not sure if I will go back."
"5.0","Just had there turkey dinner lunch and it was fantastic !  Folks, it doesn't get any better than this....  delicious and alot of food. !!  My new favorite lunch spot, as good as grandma made !  Wish I could give 6 stars. !"
"4.0","I have had Doce Taqueria bookmarked for some time now, but how often do you go out of your way for street tacos?  However, after attending a 9 PM show at City Theater, I wanted a light snack and discussion time with friends.This place is simple and good.  There are five kinds of tacos (flour or corn), nachos, and maybe taco salad?  Seating is counter-style, and there are only about nine seats. However, we snagged the last three seats on a Saturday night at 10:45 PM.I ordered a Carnitas taco on a flour tortilla ($3).  While not my favorite taco of all time, the pork was tender and good, albeit very mild.  However, they have plenty of hot sauce on the counters to spice things up.  If this place is on your way somewhere, it is worth a stop."
"5.0","I was recently turned on to Salem's as I work on the other end of the Strip District and I really dig it - great fresh food (reasonable $$) and the staff is awesome. Their butcher shop is superb too - you can get really nice beef, goat and lamb there. They have the more interesting cuts - hangar, skirt, shank, and super fresh liver, kidney and heart (my fave!).  Great burger, kofta, shawarma and a killer goat curry.  Easy parking too - they are far enough off the main part of the strip away from the hoi polloi."
"5.0","I absolutely LOVE Edgar's Tacos!!  I can't even begin to count the number of times I've been there.  They use all fresh ingredients and the salsa is amazing. Never a bad experience.  If you're in the strip district, it's a must try!"
"4.0","This place is everything you would expect from a deli and they do it very well. Quick friendly service, fresh and generous ingredients all at a reasonable price.  I had the Oakland Sandwich (all of the sandwiches are named after sections of Pittsburgh) which was essentially a triple decker BLT with turkey and American cheese on French bread. Just what I was in the mood for today only it was piled so high with ingredients that I couldn't finish the whole sandwich. If you come to the Boulevard Deli bring your appetite."
"4.0","I visited Doce Taqueria on Tues. prior to a Cinco de Mayo themed Yelp event at another nearby restaurant.  I'd been meaning to stop by, but it'd been awhile since I'd stopped for grub on the South Side.  This event, plus the fact that it was Taco Tuesday, gave me sufficient motivation to check it out.Because I knew there would be snacks at the event, I decided to go with two tacos ($3 each)--one of the daily special (BBQ pork), and one of the pollo (chicken), both on corn tortillas.  Of the two, the chicken was the more subtly flavored, consisting of the namesake meat plus avocado, cilantro, crema, and cotija cheese.  The addition of a spritz of juice from an included piece of lime added a jolt of citrusy flavor, upping the ante.  The BBQ pork, on the other hand, was a veritable flavor explosion, consisting of cherry peppers, shredded cheese, and cilantro. Though I enjoyed them both, the special was my favorite of the two due to its bold flavors.Like many eateries in the South Side, the space is pretty small, with seating limited to the bar and a small ledge by the window, and no real tables.  From my visit, it appeared that the majority of orders were of the carry out variety, but a few other people also ate in, in addition to me.  Service was pretty efficient--my order was out in 5 min, which I appreciated given that I arrived a bit later than I'd planned to.The decor was quite festive, evoking a kitschy SoCal vibe, which seemed particularly appropriate given the day and time of my visit.  The atmosphere reminded me of a similar taco shop on the North Side, but I enjoyed the food more and found the price point more reasonable.  While I'd rate the tacos at Las Palmas and Edgar's slightly higher, if you should find yourself nearby, I'd definitely say Doce is worth a visit! 4.5 stars."
"2.0","Wow.  What a disappointing meal and event.  The place was empty and we felt rushed.  My daughter and I came here before a concert at Stage AE.  We sat down and the waitress took our drink order.  She then got our meal order.  The food was ok nothing spectacular- pierogi for my kid and street taco for me.  Mine were ok at best.  The waitresses was nice and friendly but WAY to efficient.  Before our meal was finished she put our check on the table.  I mean we weren't done eating yet.  Then after she brought the check, she asked how we wanted to pay.  I never felt so rushed to get out of a place in my life.   I get it it's Jerome Bettis' place but I'm not sure it's worth the hype."
"3.0","Did someone catch the number for that train?! Or maybe I should say bus. My dad is a very big Steelers fan so whenever we get the chance to go to Heinz field and watch them play we do. Of course while you're there you need to stop in here at least one time. It was a Monday night game so the area was booming and the wait was also very long. Once we were able to sit down we were served quickly and the food was brought out quickly as well. The food was solid, prices were lower than expected, and the experience was good overall. For such a busy place they do a great job of funneling people in and out and in giving accurate wait times. Food was good, not off true charts, but definitely worth stopping in before the game. Even though I'm a Pats fan, I did enjoy my experience both a the game and here for some solid grub."
"5.0","I will certainly be back.  I ordered the Lamb Curry, which was excellent.  Although not advertised as a spicy dish, it had plenty of kick to it (a perfect amount for me), so be careful ordering something hotter. I also had one of their samosas, which were also good.  Service was fine as well, the waiter gave some good recommendations on what to order."
"5.0","I always hear so and so has the best tacos or you have to try their tacos... let me just say this no thanks.... EDGARS FOR THE WIN!!!!! Hands down THE BEST tacos in Pittsburgh. When you are within a 2 block radius of Edgars and you smell something drawing you in and you say to yourself 'What is that amazing smell?!?' It's Edgars, I can assure you! Edgar has a little stand next to Pamelas diner in the strip. The taco selection here is amazing. He always has specials which are highly recommended. I always get tacos, it doesn't matter what type, but make sure you get tacos! Once they grace your lips you will understand why Edgars is rated 5 stars across the board on yelp! I also recommend getting a horchada drink as well, best I've ever had. If you have ever had horchada you know how delicious it is, if you've never had horchada then Edgars is the best place for your first ever experience. I am literally licking my lips drooling and my stomach is rumbling just from writing this review thinking about Edgars tacos even though I just ate. I will be heading there first thing in the AM! PLEASE do yourself a favor and put Edgars on your list of must have tacos in Pittsburgh!"
"5.0","Second time I visited here  and it was awesome. Started with a mix of west coast oysters. Shared the Captain Crunch Roll and had a Caesar Salad with wild Alaskan Salmon! The salmon was cooked perfectly. Our server Kevin was very knowledgeable with our oyster selection. He had a big section all to himself and not once did I see him struggle, fluster or forgetful. He let us know that Tuesday's are half off oysters and Thursdays are 1/2 off sushi. We will definitely be back to partake in those specials."
"4.0","In town for a wedding and wanted to have some good seafood. After seeing other strong reviews of this place, we made reservations and when we arrived, we were promptly sat. Our server, Shane, came right over and took our drink orders. Great dinner menu and a terrific soft shell crab special. We took our time ordering and never felt rushed. The entrees arrived, with the exception of mine; mahi mahi tacos. The server apologized stating that they were making the corn salsa because they were all out. Least mine would be super fresh! Mine finally arrived, and Shane said that it would be taken off the bill (nice surprise!). We enjoyed all our meals and would recommend this place; casual under-the -sea vibe and matching cool seafood entrees."
"5.0","Came for breakfast.  Enjoyed the veggie omelet and husband had a breakfast sandwich.  Both were excellent.  Eggs had a great texture and the smoked Gouda added such a great flavor.  Salads complement the meal.  Service was great! I feel like we sat for less than 5 minutes and our food was out! Great environment and we loved the back patio with umbrellas.  Coffee is EXCELLENT.  Tasted like we were back in Europe. Yum!"
"5.0","I can't tell you how many times I passed this gem up, simply because when I'm in the Strip, I feel obligated to go for food from another culture entirely (I do curry or sushi here a lot).So when I was looking for a place to please a group of four friends, I didn't think of Cafe Raymond. However, we were all hungry enough that we stumbled in to the closest place: I am SO glad it was this place.Once we got in, it was obvious we'd be waiting a bit to order (the line for lunch on a Sunday is no joke!) so we took our time scoping out the menu. I have to say, I was impressed by their wide range of tantalizing options!I ended up landing on the Veggie Muffaletta, served on focaccia bread. First impression: This sandwich is massive! Definitely 2 meals, unless you go starving hungry. And it tasted Amazing. Like a folded homemade focaccia made by a loving Italian grandma.Friends got The Club, a Spinach, Mushroom and Feta Omelette, and the special of the day: Italian Style Eggs Benedict, which I tried. It was really wonderful... I liked my Veggie Muffaletta just a TAD bit more.Next for me to try: Coffeehouse Burger! I'm not usually a burger gal, but it just sounds STELLAR.I'd say this place is a must-try. With everything made from scratch and deliciously fresh ingredients, you're bound to love Raymond!"
"5.0","Tacos are not usually a huge hit with me when I go to a Mexican restaurant - I like them, but they are usually not exceptional. The tacos made out on the street outside of Reyna Foods in the Strip - awesome, and definitely the best tacos I have had anywhere. The ingredients are all great, but the grilled flavor of the tortilla and the fresh ingredients, included the freshly squeezed lime juice, complete everything and make every bite wonderful. The beef tongue and fish tacos were fantastic. Also, if you like some heat, try their homemade sauces in the big plastic jars at the end of the line. Now this is street food, baby!"
"5.0","We love Raymond's. Everyone there is friendly and helpful and the food is delicious! Try the blueberry ricotta pancakes. The coffee is wonderful.   Lunch is great too...the best hamburger in the city. Quality ingredients and quality cafe! Try it and you will go back again and again."
"5.0","So much good food for the price. Tons of meat and piles of rice for about $9. I loved the curries and gyros. The naans are gigantic. Basically, you get huge amounts of food for everything. So worth it."
"4.0","Just to let everyone know I had this idea quite a while ago to have a pizza place with unlimited toppings for one good price.  I did not copyright that idea unfortunately.  Blaze pizza does that same thing, but the one that I went to had all this ash on the bottom of it from the oven.  The pizza here is pretty much pristine and there are tons of toppings to choose from, or you can use one of their many house specials.  Not only that, but you have additional uncooked toppings that you may add to the pizza after it is a finished product.  There is lots of tablespace to chill out on and a nice veiw of the street from the dinning area.  There are also tons of beverage options including bottles coffees, sodas, sparkling waters and fountain drinks.  Yah, this place is pretty much an awesome choice at anytime.  I like this place because in order to get a good deal at most pizza places you have to order for a group of people and have everyone chip in.  With this place you can get pizza alone, or with a group and it is still a pretty good deal.  All the toppings are worth it as well and really being able to customize it is a thing of beauty.  The service was also excellent, yeee haw!"
"5.0","I've ordered delivery from Beta a few times and they've always come quickly with no issues. The delivery people are always really nice as well. Really good french fries, wings and chicken panini."
"5.0","We have visited Umami a few times now. On our first visit, we fell in love! We couldn't wait to go back. We have tried a variety of items on their menu, and have enjoyed everything. We recently visited with some friends who had never been there before. We were excited to have them try everything! We made a late reservation at 9:30, but got there early to have some drinks. They had a drink special going: a light beer and sake shot for $5. Without a table or a seat at the bar, our group was definitely in the way and had to constantly move so people could get by. There isn't room for standing at all. Once at our table, we ordered a the sashimi rice bowl to share. It offered once of the best tasting pieces of salmon I've ever had! We also ordered the edamame - It was pretty standard. For our meals we ordered the ramen and the udon noodles. Both were amazing!! Our waitress was super helpful and friendly. Only negative is that it is located on the third? floor, and you have to walk up many stairs. This would be a huge problem for anyone who has difficulty with stairs or needs an accessible entrance."
"5.0","We've been here a few times now. Service and food always great. Ordered the chicken tikka masala 5 and chicken vindaloo 7, naan bread. Flavorful and spicy. Check for Groupon or deals, worth going to!"
"4.0","Great place! The line can be intimidating but the staff does a good job of keeping it moving and ensuring you have a seat. Also there is a lot more seating upstairs too. I recommend the blueberry ricotta pancakes."
"4.0","Came here on a Friday night with my brother and we brought heavy appetites.  This place has a pretty chill vibe, it reminded me of a classic Japanese pub.  We were planning on getting a bunch of different plates and sharing them so we could try more things.  We ended up getting about 7-8 different things and I would definitely say everything was pretty solid.  The dishes that stood out to me were the handrolls(salmon, fluke, and spicy tuna), and the skewers(wagyu, chicken skin, salmon, chicken heart). If we ever came back here, I'd prob stick to those because the other dishes weren't anything special.  This place is pretty pricy($120 for 2) but I would def come back if I was in the mood for asian style tapas.Skewers: 8/10Handrolls: 9/10Karaage chicken: 7.5/10Nasu shigiyaki: 7/10"
"4.0","On Mount Washington, this place was a bit out of my way but I'm glad I stopped by for their Happy Hour. There's a bar and some tables, and it was pretty busy and loud by the time my friend and I got there around 6. Just as we made our way to the bar, we noticed that one of the tables was being cleaned up. We asked the bartender if we could sit down there, and he told us to go for it. Within a few minutes, a server brought us some water and took our orders. She let us know that we should make our cocktail orders ahead of time, because it can take a bit for them to come out (especially because it was pretty busy).The real stars of the show here are the cocktails, and you should definitely take advantage of their happy hour deal ($6)! There's most likely a drink for everyone given their extensive menu. For snacks, we ordered the Cheese Plate and the House Cut Fries off the Happy Hour menu. The Cheese Plate was great, and I loved the candied nuts that came with it. It came with three types of cheese which were all good, but two of them were pretty similar from what I remember. The fries were nice as well, but I think they accidentally gave us the Tomato Chipotle Aioli instead of the Garlic Rosemary one we ordered. Didn't bother me too much because it was still delicious! Would order the fries again next time.Final tips: Be careful going down the steep stairs to the bathroom (especially after a few drinks)! Also if you haven't already, it's worth checking out the view of downtown Pittsburgh from the nearby overlook."
"3.0","I went there recently with my family, and the food was good overall, but the service was rude.  Upon arriving there, we asked if there was a place to hang our coats, and were told it's 'a little hard to get to'; and that was it, so we crammed them into our booth.  Corkage fee was charged for the wine we brought (since the wine list is practically nonexistent), which we completely expected and appreciated that we could bring our own wine; but our waiter took the cork out of the bottle and set it down on the table and walked away. WOW.  For $10 per bottle, maybe he could have actually poured it into our glasses?  The restaurant ran out of bread that night, we were told.  The salad came with the dressing in disposable plastic cups on the side. Really?   I think Eat N Park has a better dinner salad than this!  Most Italian bistros ask if you'd like ground pepper on the salad, but this wasn't an option, so it was pepper from the shaker on the table.   We had one dessert for a birthday in our group, but our waiter never asked anyone else at the table if they wanted to order dessert or coffee.  Since the appetizers and entrees were good, I may give 'em another chance, maybe for lunch, but I am truly blown away that Alexander's was Post-Gazette's Reader's Choice Award winner for Best Italian in 2008, which is very proudly displayed in several places."
"5.0","So glad we found this place. Worked from here for two days straight eating breakfast, lunch, and lots of tea. Great spaces, nice staff, and amazing tea selection."
"5.0","Amazing food and service in a relaxed atmosphere. Everything was fresh and tasted great. If we lived here we would be regulars!"
"5.0","Best South Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh.Love the pepper fry chicken and briyani. Very authentic.It's very spicy and I love it."
"5.0","Idk why it has taken me so long to get here... but it's my new fave old school American Chinese spot.  The food is reminiscent of Chinese food the old way.  Old padded booths.  90s lighting.  Complimentary hot tea.  All you can eat crunchy noodles with an INCREDIBLE homemade sauce.The triple delight is perfect.  Also love Singapore noodle.  Fried rice is really good. The portions are huge. This random dive is def one of my new faves!"
"5.0","By far the best Penicillin drink! Cozy and comfortable atmosphere with very friendly and knowledgeable staff. Didn't get into the food but have come back specifically for the drinks!"
"5.0","I ate the Baja Shrimp, which were delicious. The portion size was just right for lunch. Our server was also very helpful, but not pushy."
"5.0","Amazing authentic tacos and the nicest people to sell 'em. Can't recommend them enough."
"5.0","Wow - best kept little secret in the Strip District!!!!  Great food, great service, great prices!!!!!  Had lunch there today with 2 friends - we were all delighted with the experience!!!  Definitely will eat there again!!!"
"4.0","The Sicilian za hit the spot at 3 AM after some late night booze-related revelries. It did take a half hour for them to make it, but at least that gave ample time for macking on the local ladies who also claimed they were from LA like all starstruck Pittsburgh girls do for some reason in the seating area. However, the guy taking orders would not accept my offer of a 100% tip to bump my order to first in line on the list: Weird."
"4.0","My boyfriend and I ordered dinner to-go here because I had a coupon for a free appetizer or dessert. We were invited to sit on sofas near the door and waited upon as if we were eating in the restaurant. It was nice, but I almost wished they had a counter where we could order because that's all we needed.We got the Ethnic Sampler appetizer, which came with two kinds of chutney. Everything was yummy. The Paneer Saag was also good (I've developed a soft spot for saag). However, the third dish we ordered (I can't remember what it was called) contained fruit (canned, I think) and was sweet, which we weren't expecting. I didn't like it as much as the other dishes.The food was good but a little expensive for me to eat there regularly. Our order lasted us for two meals, though. Also, the food would've been better if we ate it fresh. Staff was friendly and attentive as well."
"2.0","Super SALTY! Hot is very spicy, but good. Got chicken and waffles.. make sure to request maple syrup on side cause they DRENCH the waffles in it. Fries were salty, chicken was salty."
"5.0","Very cute vibe and spot! I would definitely go again. It was pretty crowded when I went on a weekend so check this place out through the week or call ahead to get a table. I only had a beer and some fries but they were both very good."
"2.0","The plates are listed as small, medium and large although apparently this doesn't relate to the quantity of food on each.  Not sure exactly what it relates to.  I ordered the scallops which was listed as medium but when the plate came there were 2 quarter seized scollops on top of some cooked greens.  Not my idea of medium, but as I said, perhaps this relates to something else.  My neighbor got a vegetarian dish which was listed as small and it's was over twice the size of mine.  Go figure?"
"4.0","A hole in wall place for Indian and Mediterranean food in Pittsburgh. I walked into this place when exploring the strip district.I got the chicken Tikka masala meal with the rice pudding as desert. - big portion size- loved the butter Nan- Chicken was a bit hard - loved the rice pudding. If you are in Pittsburgh strip district give this place a shot."
"4.0","Very nice little restaurant with good ambience.  BYOB makes it reasonably priced and all the food is delicious.  The risotto especially is cooked to perfection and has wonderful flavor."
"1.0","Salad smelled bad and was just a handful of lettuce but cost almost $10. Incredibly disappointing. Panera's has changed for the worse. It used to serve bigger salads that didn't literally smell like trash for the same price. Also Came here for a coffee and waited 30 min just to get a paper cup to serve myself coffee instantly."
"4.0","An excellent Japanese restaurant tucked into Station Square. The food and service were excellent. They have created a great ambiance of a Japanese restaurant as well."
"5.0","Salem's is and always will be one of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh- phenomenal quality food, personable staff, and unbeatable prices. Lunchtime during the week is an absolute madhouse- but the line always moves quickly, and it is definitely worth it. From authentic Indian choices to gyros and hamburgers, there is definitely something for everyone. They have cafeteria style seating if you choose to eat-in, and they also have a market connected with their meat market in the back where you are guaranteed to get a good cut of meat. Like I said, hands down, one of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh."
"2.0","For $5 a pie, how bad can it be?  Great for the price, although I think it's not as good as Domino's or Papa John's.  I used to order mass amounts from this place for Student Dorm Council meetings at CMU."
"4.0","My fianc√© and I were bar hopping on Butler and before heading home stopped to get a pizza! It was totally custom made and they make it right in front of you (similar to a Blaze Pizza)! The workers were very patient especially since I like a lot on my pizza! The price was super affordable and the brownies were also good! Highly recommend if your looking for a quick pizza place! I will certainly be back!  They also have a punch card to earn a free pizza!"
"4.0","It was delicious; i would highly recommend it to anyone in the area. They delivered to my hotel and it was still hot and fresh. The mangoes were ripe and delicious."
"3.0","It was alright, their vinaigrette made me cough from the acidity, it looked like chocolate pudding drizzle on top of their salad, which was mixed greens with a single half slice of tomato  omelette ok, served with half a slice of bread, I was confused lol nice ambience, but would probably just grab coffee next time"
"4.0","First time in Pittsburgh and we wanted to see if we could find a good Philly cheesesteak here. I think we've succeeded.Yummy, soft hoagie, tons of meat, and onions caramelized to perfection. It wasn't the best I've had, but huge portions, cheap price, and the old rusty ambiance of the place made up for it. Their fries were very good as well, plenty of crisp and flavor. They could use a bit more salt though, I almost never salt anything at the restaurant and these guys needed a little bit of love."
"3.0","Best Indian food I've ever had, really, compared to restaurants I've been to in NYC. However, the service is actually pretty terrible.  Food is half price most hours of the day (good lunch buffet option, and actual half price entrees except for between the hours of 6-7 pm), but I would recommend take-out--you'll pay full price no matter the time but the portions are good for 2-3 meals and you don't have to deal with the slow service. My go to is the chicken tikka masala or the chicken makhini, but the Chana masala and samosas are also great!"
"5.0","If you are looking for a caterer for your next party, look no further.  The food here is exceptional.   A large bowl of delicious Rustic Italian bread bathed in olive oil and tasty seasonings, with thin slices of roasted red peppers and generous shavings of parmesan cheese was on our table when we arrived.  A fresh East Coast Caesar salad was our first course with a few large green olives and kalamata mixed in, (nice) along with what looked like large homemade croutons and again generous shavings of Parmesan cheese with a delicious and light Caesar salad dressing. A flavorful, fluffy Risotto with a plentiful mix of roasted vegetables was the starch we selected which was excellent. No gummy risotto here.  Two entrees were included in the price of our luncheon.  We chose a Roasted Boneless Lemon Chicken with Fresh Mozzarella which was the most tender and flavorful piece of chicken I think I've ever tasted.  Our second entree was a grilled Dill Salmon with a Tomato & Lemon Basil Aioli.  Dessert was cheese cake topped with mixed fresh berries.  If you want delicious food, freshly prepared and reasonably priced and don't care about a fancy decor this is the place for you.  I only wished I lived closer.  Sausalido would be the first place I would call to caterer a party.  Nick knows his stuff, I was impressed."
"5.0","5 star service, food, drinks and bartenders. I used to work upstairs and its definitely a chill spot. I recommend the loaded cheese fries, Mexican burger, quesadilla and sweet potato fries"
"4.0","My omelet was excellent!  I ordered the South omelet which is steak, portobello mushrooms, onions and cheddar.  Cooked perfectly with great flavor!  Came with a delicious side salad with balsamic.  The coffee was delicious as well!  Great little breakfast spot."
"1.0","Food was awful-the 'Toast' wasn't toasted at all, the waitress seemed indifferent and not interested in anything, least of all our experience and the avocado toast was pasty and runny and disgusting.  Also, food took way too long to make, they weren't crowded and how long does it take to make eggs?"
"5.0","Excellent service and my #7 Roethlisberger was amazing!  Fresh bread and perfectly cooked sausage!  The staff was very friendly and helpful in making my selection!  I can't wait to go back!"
"4.0","Nice!  Really good tacos....made to order with all the toppings except the salsa.  The salsa comes in a squeeze bottle in mild, medium or hot.  Had the medium and it was standard medium; may try the hot next time.  Had the chorizo and carnitas Mexicano style.  These tacos are on par with Las Palmas and a couple of other taco stands in the area.  If you like real street tacos with fresh ingredients this is a good stop.There are a couple of tables and and awning cover them so you can eat at the table as everyone walks by on the sidewalk or take it with you."
"5.0","I have been meaning to write this review for months! Great restaurant. Jimmy and his staff were very welcoming to us travelling down from Canada. I would definitely go back. Thanks guys!"
"5.0","I went here with my girlfriend and I was not sure what to expect. I had been to BRGR and Burgatory before and had not been overly impressed. I was pleasantly surprised by the industrial decor upon entering. The service was fast and friendly. When we ordered, I had originally planned to get a mini burger, but our server suggested the larger as it was twice the portion size for a $3 up-charge. Our food came out quickly; I had the Maggie's Farm and my girlfriend had the Fox Chapel. Both of us were very impressed. She went as far as to say that it was the best burger that she had had. I would certainly put it in my top 5. We both decided to get the Rosemary Fries as an upgrade and theh were flavorful and refreshing. The portions were spot on and left both of us feeling satisfied, but not overly full. I will definitely be coming back here when I'm in town next time."
"5.0","Cheap, great custom pizza.There's a handful of pizza options if you don't want to decide on toppings, or you can make your own for $8.I chose the cattle ranch pizza, it came with steak, ranch, and mushrooms. The dough was soft and the crust was very lightly crunchy. Definitely better than might be expected from what looks like prepackaged dough.They also have a wide array of shakers and oils (about 5 shakers and 4 oils) by the soda.This place is kind of like if subway made fancy pizzas (in a great way). As for the price point, Im going to stop going to little Caesars, because for a couple bucks more you get a wayyy better pie here."
"5.0","These are the most delicious and most authentic tacos ever! So glad I'm able to get food like this in Pittsburgh!!"
"4.0","This was my first time eating at Mezzo or even making it to the second floor of this three story establishment. I have been to Emporio (first floor) and Il Tetto (roof top) multiple times and really enjoy the atmosphere. When you first walk up to the second floor you will notice a wine wall with so much wine!! From the wooden floor, to the wooden dining tables/chairs and the rustic brick walls I felt like I walked into a Tuscan kitchen. For my meal I ordered the Pork Risotto and I do not regret this decision one bit! I really like that you can order a half portion. I always end up taking left overs home and tonight I am proud to say I finished an entire meal. I would absolutely get this again! One thing that bugged my friends and I was when we paid our bill the waitress came to pick her tip up while we were still sitting there talking. There was only one other table in there with us so it's not like we needed to hurry and rush out. Waiters/waitresses should never do that!"
"1.0","No line management at front door, lack of service, ample angry service. Good food not worth the experience."
"4.0","My boyfriend suggested checking out Burgh'ers as something new before heading to Row House Cinema and I was pleasantly surprised! As another reviewer stated, they have delicious local and organic burgers, many named after Pittsburgh's neighborhoods, milkshakes crafted from Millie's ice cream (that are absolutely to die for) and much more. We arrived hungry and shared a Mexican War and Morningside. Both burgers were outstanding, yet the Morningside particularly was over salted and perhaps could use a hint of something sweet to offset the salt within the patty, bacon and egg. The Mexican War was my favorite as all of the flavors melted in your mouth and had the right amount of spice after each bite. The rosemary and regular fries were also tasty but again suffered from too much salt.We left pleasantly full and it's safe to say this is my favorite burger eatery in Pittsburgh by far! Simple, fresh and not-overstated decor meets great food with speedy and attentive service. We will definitely return and try something new--hopefully the beer too!"
"4.0","The Shadyside location is a smidgen less crowded than the Strip District location on the weekend. We waited inside the building for about 15 min and got seated. Look carefully because it's housed in the most inconspicuous building ever! Upstairs is this Peruvian restaurant called Feria that I would like to visit next time we're here. The hotcakes translate to: the best pancakes I've ever had. I don't even like plain pancakes all that much but these are crepe-style with thin, crispy edges and a mound of butter. Mmm...goes perfectly with whipped cream and syrup. Their speciality potatoes are really good! They're made with sour cream, I believe, to give 'em that delicate softness. Their eggs are unseasoned and small though, and it's pretty hard to mess up eggs. Every table comes equipped with hot sauce and syrup so that's a plus. The sausages are a bit dry too so definitely not their strength. Our waitress was very friendly and all the customers were really friendly too. I guess greasy breakfast food just puts everyone in a good mood?It's cash-only and you don't get a real reciept. I would say the prices are on the higher side for the basic-ness. Portions are reasonable though. Yes, I would come back or at least try another location as well."
"3.0","So many great reviews.  Friends who live or have lived in Pittsburgh rave about this place.  It was supposed to be THE PLACE for breakfast and brunch in this city.  I first visited this place on a short Pgh Apt hunting trip back in April 2013.  Went in, got excited, as the place was packed with people.  It had the classic diner feel.  It had to be good.  Sadly, it wasn't.  Not wanting to give up hope, I went back to Pamela's the next day, and went with the corned beef hash, since many yelpers had mentioned it.  Again, disappointed.  Having settled in Pgh for a few months now, I decided to give Pamela's a third chance recently.  *sigh.  I don't get how this place has such high yelp ratings.Food = (6.5/10) = As mentioned above, my first visit I tried the western omelet.  It was just ok.  Not well seasoned, and the cheese was meh.   Quantity wise, you do get a huge amount of food for what you pay for.  Second trip was the corned beef hash trip.  Really don't understand what is so great about this dish.  My third trip I tried the tex-mex omelet.  Again, eggs under seasoned, and cheese was meh.  What bothered me the most was the 'guacamole.'  It's more like avocado paste with mayonnaise consistency.  Like something you would squeeze out of a toothpaste tube. Texture was not appealing.  The friend who came with me on this third trip ordered the pancakes, which he thought were fine.Ambiance = (7.5/10) = it's got the classic diner feel, with diner friendly waitresses/waiters.  Service (8.0/10) = as mentioned above, the classic diner friendly environment.Overall opinion = I wonder if those who give high ratings to this establishment, are the locals of Pgh, and college/grad students on a budget and naturally appreciate the large quantities of food for cheap prices.  This place is just ok for me.  I'm still searching for my go-to-brunch place in Pittsburgh.  I do recommend trying this place out and making your own judgement, especially if you've just moved to the area.  There is always a wait to get in on weekends, so they must be doing something right.  Place is cash only."
"5.0","Is always a pleasure to have breakfast here!!! We order the brunch special with a fruit plate, farmers special crepe and a Nutella banana crepe."
"5.0","This is for sure my go-to pizza place every time I'm downtown! I've been getting pizza from here for 3 years now and it's the best college pizza you could ask for. The place itself is very cute, decently roomy in size and has a nice bar. The staff is nice and we always get our orders correct! Whether you're dining in or getting it delivered, Genoa is the way to GO!"
"2.0","This is your typical average chinese restaurant.  Low quality ingredients creating ehh food, but it's not the worst chinese food.  If you're looking for a quick lunch place downtown, they get five stars.  But the Subway next door would be better."
"5.0","Nashville Hot Chicken! So good. First I was skeptical to get any level of hotness but I went with medium and it was the perfect level. The sandwiches has coleslaw and homemade pickles. Plus they have a bar!!!!!"
"4.0","Stopped in before hitting the strip district for some Saturday shopping. The atmosphere is casual and cozy, we were invited to seat ourselves wherever we liked. We quickly perused the menu and decided on cappuccinos to start with. The cappuccinos are very sizable and pretty good quality. I mentioned to our server that we were thinking about Turkish coffee, but he told me that was typically reserved for after the meal. I decided on the veggie omelet and my boyfriend got the Mona sandwich. Both were fabulous, but the Mona sandwich was definitely the winner... try it! We also split a Nutella and banana crepe, which should not be missed. After we finished up, the waiter remembered we were interested in Turkish coffee, and asked if we would still like some but unfortunately we were way too full. Will definitely be back to try it out though!The only reason I am rating Caffe Mona a 4 is because of the bathroom cleanliness. Wish it was a bit more well maintained."
"5.0","Amazing flatbread, perfectly cooked every time, and has never messed up my very complex 'Make-Your-Own' online order. Tony is incredibly kind, generous and attentive to detail. We order 8-9 flatbreads per working lunch a week and he has never messed up one order. They are made very quickly and he even labels the boxes for us! Thank you Tony for going above and beyond, your flatbreads are delicious!"
"4.0","We had some delicious take-out from Thai Gourmet last Saturday night.  We placed the order by phone, and then left almost immediately to pick it up.  The food was ready when we got there about 15 minutes later.  The prices were pretty good, and since you get such large portions, your money goes a long way.The food was still hot when we got it home (yay!) so we immediately dug in.  First was our appetizer, the Hoi Jo - sort of a deep fried appetizer made of crabmeat, ground pork, and spices.  Sweet plum sauce accompanied it.  This appetizer was really tasty, a bit dry but the plum sauce really livened it up.  My boyfriend had the panang curry with chicken, which he really enjoyed.  I tasted it briefly and agreed it was very good, better quality than lots of other Thai we've had.  I got the Chiang Mai Me, which I'd never heard of but ended up being a great choice!  It was long egg noodles covered in a wonderful yellow curry sauce.  I got it with tofu, which was cut into long strips instead of cubes, and was also a little dry so I'd recommend maybe trying chicken or another meat instead.  Nonetheless, the curry sauce was excellent and abundant, and made glorious leftovers.  They also threw in fortune cookies AND these two super-moist brownies!  They were probably just made from a box mix, but still - it was awesome to have a surprise dessert.I think we'd definitely order from here again.  It was above average, though not hugely so.  But our first impression was very good, and it's a very welcome change from all the Chinese food in our neighborhood."
"5.0","One of my favorite Mt. Wash bars. Bottled beer selection is pretty affordable. Their drafts are usually pricier but worth the money, as they are top-notch.  Guess that song trivoa on Wed is a blast."
"1.0","I would highly recommend that anyone in search of good food or good service find somewhere else to visit. I visited Caffe Mona with a group of friends and it was absolutely awful. There were hour long delays in individuals orders coming out, multiple orders were mixed up, and despite various clarifications about orders, they were unable to correct it. Additionally, the manager was extremely rude when concerns were raised. But perhaps the worst part of the experience was the below average food. In sum, there are many amazing brunch/lunch locations in Pittsburg but Mona's isn't one of them."
"5.0","The food is always good.  Big portions. Worth the time and trip. We've been there several time over the last 13 tears and it great."
"5.0","I've followed Edgar wherever he has a restaurant a small stand and now this place. Super tasty, lots of great salsas, fyi you can buy them by the pint to take home the Chipotle being my favorite.Whenever visiting the strip I pip n for a couple days f tacos. Reasonably priced at 2 for $5 , in fact had some for breakfast when biking through the strip today. Deliciosos!"
"2.0","Tried them for the 1st time last night. Got the ultra huge 45 slice cheese pizza. They delivered in a good amount of time. The delivery man didn't give me any change back, he just left assuming I was giving him the whole thing. The pizza had no flavor what so ever! I think if I'm paying $39.99 for a pizza there should be some flavor to at least get my taste buds watering... & at least automatically come with 1 topping! Not sure if I'll give them another try"
"5.0","Phenomenal. From the atmosphere to the food, i was impressed from the moment I walked in the door. Tenderloin with lobster tails was incredibly flavorful and like none I've had before. Food was slightly delayed but was graciously replaced with a generous discount to our bill before we even realized our food was delayed (all thanks to that wine special). Everyone works hard for satisfaction at this restaurant and have truly earned a solid 5 star review."
"4.0","Salem's provides authentic, delicious, quality Indian food. Honestly, the food here is delicious! I'll tell you what you need to order . . . Chicken tikka masala with chickpeas and (when you get to the cashier) naan bread (made fresh). This entire meal will cost you about $12. However, this will be 2 meals, easy. The portion sizes are massive. Honestly, this place is a hidden gem. I'm half-torn writing this review because I selfishly want Salem's all to myself. It's seriously that good. What an amazing value. The only reason this place receives 4 stars is because of the vibe inside. It's basically a high school cafeteria. That's what it feels like. But I don't care. I really don't. The food is amazing, and when you get to this level of quality you wouldn't care if you were eating in a horse stable (pungent). Kidding... Parking is great and they even have their own little lot. They take card. You have a hankering for some Indian food or maybe just want to take a step outside of your comfort zone? Perhaps you want to step back into your glory days of high school? Enter into the cafeteria serving pure deliciousness, which is Salem's. You won't regret that decision."
"5.0","Ohh Umami, you have ruined me.  I think it was Tom Collichio who said in an interview once (to paraphrase)  'we don't sell food, we sell happiness.'  And if something makes the customer happy, do it.  That's how I feel about Umami.  No question the food is excellent, but that's just the start of the 'experience' at Umami that makes it so special.Starting from the theater of entering through a nondescript side door, and climbing two narrow flights of steep steps, you are transported to a different environment.  Your menu remains on the table, supporting the 'order as you go' style encouraged on the first page of the menu.  There's something subtle and wonderful about that.  It makes the usual restaurant feel somehow industrial.  Please complete your order from this list, and I will submit it for manufacture, and have it shipped to your table.  You will then eat and leave. Umami is nothing like this.The open kitchen is more theater, and the precision of the chefs is great to watch.  Have a sake, and enjoy some fresh barbecued skewers of smoky wonderfulness, order several, they're small and yummy.  Then maybe put in an order of Okonomiyaki (a terrific Japanese savory pancake).  More theater, as the Pancake arrives with shaved bonito flakes sprinkled over the top, which will gently dance in the heat as it rises from the pancake.  Animated, delightful. The waitstaff is knowledgable, busy, never rushed, always attentive, never seeming to care if they turn the table (the opposite in fact).  After the pancake, we ordered handrolls, which came with a little pipette of soy which you use to add drips of soy as you eat the savory cone of goodness (that's theater too, I guess, and it's fun and makes the eating better).And on the night we were there they even had a DJ spinning subterranean grooves and atmosphere, Subtle, and supportive of a place to go to spend time, rather than to just eat a meal. Others have been more eloquent about the food, and the food really is excellent, but what makes Umami a true gem is the experience.  Umami serves happiness, and I'm grateful to have them so close by. We've been twice, and it was that good both times."
"2.0","It is reviewed as one of the best museum cafes in the nation, but I was not impressed. I can't comment on the food since I didn't try any, however I tried their iced coffee and the green juice. As the lady making my green juice was preparing the fruits and vegetables, she did not wash any of the items she was putting into the juicer and did not take the time to remove any stickers, therefore those pesky little stickers went straight into the juicer and made it into my drink! Definitely a turn-off. The iced coffee was nothing to write home about and looking around at the selection of food from other customers, the portions were small and not very appetizing. A gorgeous conservatory, but eat and drink before you spend your afternoon in the beautiful Phipps!"
"4.0","Quiche was outstanding! Loved the acoustic music and Sunday afteroon brunch vibe.  Friendly service and delicious food!"
"4.0","This is my favorite pie in the city... even though it's flatbread.  The gluten free crust is amazing, the best I've found. I always do the create your own, and add on unlimited fresh veggies.  The spicy red sauce is my personal fave.  Service is quick. The cost cannot be matched for fast food to quality ratio. Thank you!! 4 stars only bc of the looks of the salads and seating ambience could be better! Get a flatbread not a salad here.."
"3.0","This is our first time to eat at this restaurant. We were seated promptly to our table. We waited less than 5 min for our server to greet us.  After our order was placed we waited around 20 minutes for the food to come.  I ordered a cheeseburger but when the burger arrived there was no cheese. Should I say something. No I did not. The burger was very dry and not much flavor.    Looking around the chairs were all knicked and the carpeting good use a good cleaning.     Would I return?  Probably not. Jerome put some money in this place."
"4.0","I was here with a friend a few days ago for dinner around 6:30. I had never gone and wanted to check it out at some point because I'd always heard generally favorable reviews. There were a few people waiting in the foyer and the waiter told us it would be a 20-25min wait. The thing I found most peculiar though was that there were clearly at least 2 other tables that would seat two available in the dining room. When we asked about this, we were told there were people ahead of us waiting for a table. That makes sense, but I could see the other parties of two weren't being seated either. After waiting for half an hour we were about to leave but a waiter called us back and asked us to wait a bit longer, offering a free appetizer for our patience. Eventually we were seated and I realized they were waiting to seat the party of 3 ahead of us at a bigger table. I'm still a little confused about the need to have us wait for them to be seated first because they had a larger group that wouldn't fit at one of the small tables. So although we arrived after them, I'm sure they would have understood that parties of 2 could be seated earlier. I'm not sure if I'm missing something here but generally I think it makes sense to seat based on capacity and not strictly order. Anyway, I ended up ordering the Chicken Korma and the quality was excellent. This and the free appetizer was enough to make me forget my prior displeasure concerning the long wait for being seated and getting food."
"5.0","I discovered Salem's nearly 3 years ago, after buying a Groupon for the place. When I walked in, I was suprised by the 'cafeteria' set-up, with a large open area to sit and eat, a very casual atmosphere indeed. The menu was listed on a large board, with so many options I was overwhelmed. Most of the items listed I had: A. Never Heard of Before or B. Never Tried.  I was intrigued by the menu and everything smelled delicious, so I listened to the patrons infront of me in line, and went ahead with what they ordered-- the chicken schwarma. I had never tried Indian food before, but to me, it looked like a gyro and I was willing to try that-- the 2 ppl ahead of me liked it, so maybe I would to. At the end of the long counter of food options, was a section of dessert, so I took a piece of baklava and paid for my meal, which was just under $10. That's a pretty good deal I'd say, considering the large portions you get at Salem's. The schwarma had a mouth-watering smell-- definitely made with curry and other Indian spices and fresh, warm bread, I couldn't wait to dig in. I was suprised by the taste, it was so different from anything I'd ever had before, but I loved it! It was so good I tried to finish the whole thing, but there was no way, because it is a big portion of food, more than I could eat in one sitting. I was so satified with my meal, that I vowed to make it a regular spot for lunch if I was in the area.Over the last few years, I've been back many times and have tried other things, but I always seem to go back to my first love, the shwarma. **Also, the employees are so friendly, you feel very welcome there! I'm so glad that they offered a Groupon for this place, because I would've probably never tried it & just grabbed lunch at Peppi's or something 'safe/norm', not knowing about it, but in my opinion, the food here is better!! Try it, you will be having sweet dreams of schwarma."
"3.0","This place is hit or miss. Definitely a greasy spoon joint. One time tor there and the staff couldn't be more friendly. The next time you go in be weary of a older lady at the register couldn't be more upset that you walked in and interrupted her picking fries out of the warmer.The food is pretty good if you are looking for a greasy cheese steak and fries type of meal. Again just don't go here and expect to be said hello or thank you to. The regular cheesesteak and Cajun fries are pretty good."
"1.0","I am not much of a Yelp reviewer but after my experience here I had no choice but to write a review and let the public know about the food being served here.I have been going to Prince of India since my freshmen years ago and I had nothing but postive experiences for years but today may be my last day after what I found in my takeout buffet box.I ordered the buffet for takeout and as I was enjoying my lunch at home I found a MOSTLY EATEN SOGGY, CHEWED UP, NAAN in my chicken...Nope, not my own naan that I got because I had two FULL pieces of naan that I had previously already finished. I immediately stopped eating and just threw the rest away as my appetitie was now gone.Now how does a chewed up, eaten naan get into FRESHLY COOKED FOOD that is brought out often for the buffet? Well either someone was trying to sabotage the business which is highly unlikely because just why would someone do that or like other shady buffet restaurants, they REUSE FOOD brought back to the kitchen. There is absolutely NO REASON why leftover food brought back into the kitchen should go ANYWHERE NEAR freshly cooked food unless it is done on purpose. I am sorry but there is simply NO EXCUSE for this type of behavior."
"4.0","This place was such a hole in the wall, but really good. It's actually a lot bigger than I was expecting. You walk-in, order from the menu on the wall, and then wait at a table with the number they give you. They shout out the # when the food is ready and with a simple wave of your number the waitress found me and brought out my food. Since the ordering is at the front and there was only 1 cashier, the line got a bit long since my group was about 20 and there were also other patrons. This occurred around 3:00 on a sunny Saturday.The food was really cheap, and it was good. I could have gone for more food since it wasn't a huge serving, but it hit the spot and accomplished what I set out for. There's also free chips with guac and queso.The inside had lots of decorations drafting down from the ceiling, as well as stuff on the walls. It made it feel like an authentic Mexican place. There was also futbol playing from the World Cup which added to that element.The owner said that the liquor license was delayed about a month. I wasn't able to order a Corona, but anticipate by late July or August that the drafts will be flowing. At least I hope so for their sake. Either way, it's a cool place to check out near the strip."
"3.0","Came here for a farewell celebration for a co-worker. Laid-back atmosphere and good service. Had the wings and they were really good."
"5.0","We stopped here on a whim before catching a flight. We let our server know we were slightly pressed on time, and she was awesome about getting our order in quickly. Very large beer selection, I don't typically drink beers and was able to find something I really enjoyed! The food was also great, highly recommend the pork dumplings."
"4.0","A great 2 story bar with a kitchen open 'til 1 am on Saturday; sit upstairs if you want a quiter aesthetic. Great food, great drinks, great prices.My only complaint, our surver was unattentive and absent minded, yet the other servers picked up his slack. Props to then. 4/5, Would eat here again."
"1.0","I tried this place once and the pizza was TERRIBLE... it was thin, unsavory, and cold.  I chalked it up as a loss, and a month later I found myself with my friends wanting to order up some pizza again.  I advised them not to choose Gennaro's as it was the worst pizza in the Southside, but they went against me and we ordered.  Again, it was straight up terrible! pizza, and it took over one hour to arrive during a not even busy time.  I will never be eating here again, and telling all my friends to do the same.  Go to Sal's pizza, they are the best, but don't deliver"
"5.0","This place has the most beautiful, luxurious pastries in Pittsburgh. I just got done eating 2 of them, I meant to save them but dang I couldn't. I just ate both. One was a macaroon sandwich filled with raspberries and sweet cream, the other was a pistachio cream. Both were amazing."
"1.0","Waited 20 minutes for a bartender to wait on me only to find out they were sold out of the drinks I wanted to order. And for $10 per beer, they should be able to afford some air conditioning. What a shit hole."
"5.0","V3 Flatbread Pizza Is one of my favorite pizza places in pittsburgh.Each pie is one price with as many toppings you want.Each pie is aprox for one person and is $8.The staff are super friendly and very helpful.I have been there several times and love it.I had a pie with extra sauce and black olives and pepperoni.it was cooked perfectly and tasted great.Every pie is made by hand and they use a small version of a dominos oven.The pizza tastes great, The staff is fast and friendly and the place is clean and has seating.I will definitely be going here over and over again.If you are in the area you definitely want to stop and get a pie you won't regret it."
"4.0","The food was amazing I would give that full 5 stars!!! Unfortunately I had a bad experience that makes me give o my 4. I was not at the restaurant but delivery and I'm not sure if it was a normal person who works there or just someone that drives but he represented then and made it unpleasant.  I would highly recommend the restaurant. Everything I ordered was perfect!!!"
"4.0","I love this place! I love the idea of paying a flat price for as many toppings as you want! I picked out a flatbread with all of the vegetables and mozzarella cheese. It was super delicious and I loved that you could choose garnishes for your pizza after it cooked. The staff could've been more attentive and kind but other than that, I will be back!"
"2.0","First and foremost, I love Chikn. I go here weekly. Some like it hot- well, this place was practically built for me! Though, I will say, I recently experienced some disappointment. I went there for breakfast. I ordered their breakfast chicken sandwich... easy enough. But I wanted it H O T. I was told 'I'm sorry ma'am, we don't offer our heat levels with our breakfast sandwiches.' Okay, walk me through this.... your website is 'hotchikn.com' and you DON'T offer HOT CHICKEN for breakfast? Hm.............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Also, they don't take cash which is pretty much ruining their ability to market to Industry workers (aka people who are EXCLUSIVELY paid in cash). Anyways, LOVE THIS PLACE. LOVE THE CHICKEN. PLEASE GIVE ME HOT CHICKEN FOR BREAKFAST. Love, A concerned hot chicken enthusiast."

"5.0","I've never been to Nashville, so I don't quite have the proper context for Nashville hot chicken. But I do know that it is supposed to be painfully spicy. So when asked how hot I wanted my chicken sandwich, there was really only one thing I could say.'Damn hot!'Which is when then nice woman behind the cash register offered me a warning.Her: Have you ever been here before?Me: No, but I'm from upstate New York. To me, that made a lot of sense. But apparently it doesn't to everyone. Regardless, she put in my order, and I received a chicken sandwich which was truly damn hot. It was angry hot. But it was also fantastically delicious. Food this spicy demands your attention and respect. You eat it slowly. Chew it thoroughly. And appreciate all the textures and sensations of the dish. Otherwise, it will kick you in the back of the throat.Did I sweat? You bet.My face also turned a deeper shade of red. But in part that was because it was pretty warm in the upstairs dining area. We were there with some kids, and wanted to be a bit out of the way.I wish I could say everyone else enjoyed their meals as much as I did. The less hot chicken has a sweetness to the coating that my daughter found unappealing. The plain chicken strips were fine, but were missing a wow factor. Chicken and waffles could use crispier waffles, but that's all besides the point. Mac and cheese was just too rich to be enjoyable, even in small quantities, and even to kids who love cheesy goo.Go to CHiKN for the damn hot chicken sandwich, or go home. If it turns out that it's too hot for you to eat, at least you can say that you tried."
"4.0","I went for lunch here on a holiday. It was a little too busy for the amount of staff they had but not too bad. I tried the feijoada, which is a black bean and carrots stew with chicken. It was hearty and flavorful, with a generous chunk of bread a lot like French bread--crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. I had a cup of regular coffee, which I thought was really quite good. This is a nice change from everyday food."
"1.0","I am puking a little in my mouth, just writing this review.  I will never spend another dime at this establishment.  The eggrolls are gross and the insides are mushy and soggy they taste like they have been prepared a month in advance and the vegetables inside have the consistency of baby food. I ordered a sweet and sour chicken. The canned fruit was cold as if the cook had just dumped it onto the plate right before serving.  What a disappointment of a restaurant my family and I use to love eating here."
"4.0","Had a great, easy dinner here with colleagues in town for a conference. We had a mix of people and tastes, all which were happy with their selections. Our server was super helpful and efficient. Not a high end foodie place, but good for groups and reasonable prices."

"5.0","Wow! Went here for date night and had a fabulous time. Our waiter (Ed? I think) was amazing. He was the perfect mix of present at the right moment, funny, and interested in interacting with us while not feeling intrusive or aloof. We tried a few different dishes. To start we had a reservation so the table was already ready with bread and a white bean dip for when we arrived (nice touch). This was delicious and a great alternative to the basic bread and butter. Then we ordered the cream of mushroom soup and the smoked Gouda appetizer. We were floored! Now the cream of mushroom soup was a misnomer, because there wasn't much cream, though this is not a complaint. The soup was a delicious blend of mushrooms which gave it a delicious richness without the heaviness of cream. As good as the mushroom soup was the Gouda was better. This is one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten. I loved the creaminess of the cheese and the brightness of the vinaigrette. For our entrees I ordered the duck and my husband ordered the ricotta gnocchi. He loved his pasta, though it wasn't really for me (personal preference) and my duck was so delicious! I loved the duck and the sauce, but I couldn't even touch the mashed potatoes after all of the delicious food we had!I can't wait to come back and try more of the menu! BYOB was also a big plus!"
"1.0","Had high hopes, but majorly let down. Maybe bc it was restaurant week. Maybe bc it was a Tuesday night. Maybe bc ppl like Tom Brady continue to dominate the NFL when you really just wish he'd jump off a cliff. I had the salmon with crab in a ginger soy glaze. Salmon was overcooked yet the skin was flabby. Had lobster bisque to start, which justifies one star. An hour and fifteen minutes later I got my overcooked salmon and 2nd drink. The glaze was pretty sweet and definitely cancelled out the crab since it got lost in the glaze. Dessert was included in the restaurant week menu but we finally asked for it to go after a 2+ hour experience. We had reservations and the hostess mentioned that they had stopped accepting walk-ins that night bc of the amount of reservations they had. Not sure why they seemed surprised by the size of the crowd - and to me, it seemed normal. Service was subpar at best. Ah well. Disappointed but I'll live."
"5.0","Arnold's is such a wonderful addition to East Ohio Street. You walk into the lovely space and totally forget you are in the city. It has a cool, welcoming vibe. Ms Verna really knows her stuff and the tea selection is amazing. We held an afternoon tea there last month and everything was delicious, especially the kalamata spread on the cranberry bread. You could taste the time and love that went into making all the delicious treats and finger sandwiches. Do yourself a favor and get to the monthly tea. If you only have time to stop in for a cold drink their Lavenade is quite refreshing too!"
"5.0","The best little gem of a taco joint. Bar seating and that's it. Even if you have to eat your tacos standing up, you don't give a damn because they're that delicious. Great vegan and vegetarian options. And if you're like me and go often, they'll even switch up the veg tacos for you if you ask :-)"
"4.0","Great tacos... or was I influenced by that 2 am feeling?Carnitas are the best, the American are meh..."
"2.0","This was one of the worst experiences ever, the food is so basic, nothing is especial about this place, it's kind of overpriced (we paid $40 for two). They weren't clear about pricing either. The menu says $9.99 with the choice of meat but you find out later from the bill that they charge you extra for the meat!!! I ordered two eggs breakfast with chicken, but chicken was simply boiled and tasteless , I could not even touch it. The coffee was even worse than the ones you get from creepy gas stations, the egg did not have salt on it, there was only 6 pieces of home fries, I will never try this restaurant anymore. The only reason I gave two stars was for their friendly staff."
"5.0","This place was so good! I really wanted the jumbo lump crab eggs Benedict but sadly the last one was sold right before I ordered. I had a delicious omelette instead and my hubby and I split the ricotta blueberry pancakes. They were so fluffy and so good. I'm not a big pancake eater but I'd have them again. Order at the counter and pay for food, it's delivered to your table and you can leave when finished without having to wait for the check. I'll definitely go back. Sandwiches looked awesome and the two guys cooking were so good. Fully seated and they were turning it out as fast as orders came in. Great spot for brunch."

"5.0","So everybody has been raving about Maria's Biscottis, well those claims are completely true. Especially when it comes down to their pumpking biscotti. That stuff is incredible and I also love the fact that this biscotti is doughy. Anyway, another one of my favorite things to get here is their nut rolls. We have actually bought a few nut rolls to take down with us to GA per request.  I also tend to get their soups which are very convenient they sell a quart for $7 a pop. My favorites so far have been their wedding soup which has a nice fresh flavor to it (I think they put some citrus in there) and their canellini and escarole soup. Both soups are definite winners. Another thing I love about their store is that it always smells of baked goods. So yummy! They also have a few kitchen gadgets and various Italian decorations,cooking tools, and italian themed gifts."
"1.0","DO NOT order the hoagies!!! I used to get pizza from here all the time and it was pretty good, nothing amazing but it was decent. Then I decided to branch out and try some other things on the menu. I ordered hoagies for me and my girlfriend and we both got incredibly sick. I decided it must have just been a fluke and ordered different hoagies the next time and got sick AGAIN. I will never order anything from here, any place that makes me that sick is not somewhere I want to order my food from."
"5.0","Stumbled across Cafe Raymond a few years ago while everyone was waiting in line next door. This place is a gem and now our breakfast 'go to' whenever we come to Pittsburgh. And, once again, it did not disappoint! The Guy's Breakfast is a perfect taste of everything--perfectly cooked eggs (and not greasy), yummy potatoes (also not greasy!) and blueberry ricotta pancakes to die for! Breakfast croissant was incredible. The decor and ambience is like someone welcomed us into their home. I just love this place and wish we could bring Cafe Raymond back to Mission Viejo, CA!"
"5.0","The food is great and tasty. I consider Tamarind at the top of the list when it comes to Indian food in Pittsburgh.The service is good and the staff are friendly and accommodating. We ordered the Chicken Makhni and the Chicken Tikka with Garlic Naan. DELICIOUS!"
"5.0","In Pittsburgh and craving a burger this is the place to go. Farm to table excellence! We went with the Maggie's Farm and Morningside. Both cooked to order and perfection! The rosemary and fresh cut fries are well worth it too. Highly recommend and they serve veggie options as well. We will definitely return on our next trip to Pittsburgh."
"3.0","Decent. Sat outside on a Friday evening. Wasn't to busy large portions. Slow waitress. Had to get up a few times to get some forks and napkins. Poor boy wasn't good at all. Greasy and nothing to it. The Cobb salad redeemed this place. Very large and tasteful. Will go back for salads but will sit inside so we can get some service."
"1.0","Sat down to order drinks with our slice of pizza from next door and they refused to serve us because we got a slice of pizza.  Who does that?! Bad business.... will never go here again!"
"3.0","I've always got food delivered from Prince Of India, never really eaten there.The most amazing take away Indian food. Quick delivery, always accurate and good food. Being a big fan of Biryani, I order it quite frequently and it isn't the best in Pittsburgh. Their mango lassi is top notch, chicken samosas, lamb vindaloo, chicken chilly are decent, my personal favorite would be the lamb curry. Slightly over priced but, they seem to be the only Indian food place that delivers to South Side in Pitt. I would rate it a 3.5 if yelp allowed it. If you live in South Side and crave some good old Indian cuisine when its too cold to step out (make sure you tip good :P ) or when you're too lazy to cook, Prince of India is the place to call."
"4.0","I always come here for their Korma curry and the creamy curry with spinach, these are my favorites! Add whatever protein you like and it's great. The appetizer I would pick is Chicken 65. This place is good for friend and family gatherings, with natural lights shining in - very relaxing. I am a non-spicy eater, and I like it here!"
"3.0","So I came into Doce Taqueria expecting excellent service and there was a blonde here that was here and is super impersonal but the guy cook was super nice and conversation with the customers. The girl was treating the customers like they we weren't important. Vinnie was awesome!"
"5.0","Umami was incredible! I expected great things, and they delivered.Entry is on the side of Round Corner Cantina up a couple flights of stairs into a NYC-like restaurant. Lighting is very dim and the decor is authentic to Japanese culture with a trendy twist. I did not feel like I was in Pittsburgh anymore!I started my meal with the wagyu beef tenderloin skewers and the bacon quail eggs. Both were flawless. The beef was incredibly tender and the eggs, well, anything wrapped in bacon is going to be a winner. My next course was the pork gyoza pot stickers. The sesame sauce was very flavorful and the fried potstickers were the perfect texture. My main course was the tonkotsu ramen. Wow! I haven't had many experiences with 'ramen' other than my college dorm room, but this is NOTHING like that. The pork ribs fell off the bone and the broth had such a great mix of spicy, sweet, and savory flavors. After seeing the portion of ramen, I maybe should have passed on an app or two. Umami is such a unique and exceptional addition to Pittsburgh's growing food scene. This is definitely my new spot to bring out-of-towners. This could be my new favorite Pittsburgh restaurant!"
"4.0","Came here for lunch one day and really enjoyed it. I tried two of the shrimp tacos (without cheese or sour cream) on corn tortillas. The price was right and the flavors were super fresh and delicious. I will be returning!"
"5.0","I really enjoyed Burgh'ers Brewing! The night I was there, they were collaborating with Pizza Talarico (I think?) so we could eat pizza or burgers. I thought this was such a cool concept. I'm pretty plain so I went with a bacon, egg and cheese mini burger, and I got a side of cheese sauce and dipped the burger into it. It was so good. I definitely suggest dipping it in the cheese if you're into that. The fries were a treat- super crispy. I was really impressed."
"1.0","I came here to eat for years with my wife who loved the quiche and I loved the salmon salad. They just changed the menu for some reason, probable money issues.  The salmon salad was removed for some Asian noddle dish that is a cheap joke.  My wife spoke to the boss, who was eating a salmon salad and she said people requested a change.  I still think it was a money issue, I wish they would just of raised the price and keep it on the menu. Very sad, we are eating somewhere else. If people didn't want it why was it sometimes sold out and why was the boss eating it? Very sad!"
"3.0","I heard this place had the best sushi in Pitt.. Personally, I thought the food was ok - not bad but also not worth the money, either. The desserts, on the other hand, were pretty tasty - had tempura ice cream and chocolate cake with ice cream, both were decent."
"5.0","Hands down the best 'hot cakes' I've ever had. Hot cakes are a cross between crepes and pancakes and they are delicious! Fairly long wait here on a Sunday morning so come prepared to stand around for awhile. I also tried their famous potatoes (I forget the name but they have cream cheese in them) and they were amazing as well. Great place and I will be back!"
"2.0","OK. I came here for breakfast since most of the usual Bloomfield breakfast places were closed in preparation for the annual Italian Festival. Wrong move.Well, I'm the only one in the place, and I waited a long time for my food. I got the American breakfast which consisted of eggs, ham, potatoes, and a roll and coffee. I hated the coffee, but I am a 'coffee snob,' so I'll give them that. The eggs were not flipped over, as requested, and the roll was bordering on stale. Good potatoes, good ham.Overpriced? You bet! Not coming back."
"5.0","Great Cafe, food is very good. My daughter starts working her soon. Diane was very friendly and helpful. Highly recommend."
"5.0","I had the Best Chicken sandwich . It was 8 dollars but it was worth the price. Large Chicken breast. Crispy and not hard or greasy. Slaw and pickles and a special sauce on top. I don't like pickles but this was so good I ate the pickles. I had the tenders the day before also great, You only need the 3 tender deal if you are hungry. the five would be good for 2 people. Ill definitely be back for more soon."
"5.0","We were looking for a place to have a late lunch on the North Side and stumbled upon Arnold's Tea. What a find! Had a yummy bacon turkey melted cheese club on a baguette and really enjoyed it and the matcha marathon smoothie. Nice ambiance and great too that they participated in Britsburgh with complimentary teas, scones and dainties. Glad we found it and we won't be strangers!"
"1.0","Bottom of the cooker fries, the sauce on the wings is so hot that it's not edible.  The gyro didn't even come with cucumber sauce (they put ranch sauce instead). The steak that they use is steak-ums.  Will NEVER order from here again!!!"
"4.0","We went here on a game morning. 4 stars because I don't think this was indicative of a normal visit. We had food and drinks. Drinks were all in disposable plastic. Not the greatest but I understand because of the timing. Nacho tots were great. We had a mix of breakfast and lunch. Pizza was good. Tacos were good. We were not rushed out even with a crowd outside. Lots of tvs for games. Just a really nice game day atmosphere."
"3.0","I really wanted to like this place. Service was excellent but the food was not. I started with the fried calamari. How it managed to arrive without flavor is beyond me. Normally fried food is great just because it's fried but this calamari had no flavor, just crunch. Then I had the chicken over polenta which was strictly white meat and arrived over what seemed more like cream then polenta. It was not so much comfort food as food. I capped things off with he strawberry panna cotta. The dessert arrived with angel food pieces that tasted better than the panna cotta. If you're hungry you can get a meal at a decent price here. Just don't expect it to give you any thrills."
"4.0","Great vegetarian options, friendly service. Coffee station was fun and unusual because you can add all of your own flavor pumps, might have gotten a bit carried away... but HUGE mugs if you're dining there, super awesome. Prices very reasonable. My egg white avocado sandwich was already cold when delivered, but still very yummy and flavorful."
"4.0","Been here several times. I am not a drinker, here for food. Decent size serving. The slice of carrot cake was humongous! It was very good non the less."
"5.0","I agree, Yelp - As good as it gets! Starting with the service (especially Chris the manager) the staff is as welcoming as the decor. We had a large group (9) and we were late for our reservation. No problem, even with a packed house on Valentine's Day. We had a number of apps, including an outstanding bruschetta, and they were all well liked and devoured. There were a few pizzas for dinner that drew a lot of 'yum' sounds, I sampled my wife's mushroom risotto that was truffle-laced heaven, and I ordered a hot sausage panini that was different and delicious. Can't say enough good things about Mezzo. Just remember the meatballs are only available downstairs!"
"5.0","This place is fantastic. The heirloom tomato salad was one of the best things i have ever eaten."
"2.0","Visits: Once, for lunch at the grill. Won't comment on the market, because I made no purchases there.Food: My friend and I shared three dishes - the lamb kebab, the beef kebab, and the shawarma. The beef was reasonably good, with a decent blend of spices and a soft texture with separable strands - almost more like it'd been roasted rather than grilled. That's where the good ends. The shawarma was made of spiced ground meat, which wasn't what I expected, though I don't consider that an issue. What was an issue was that it veritably exuded oil, and somehow managed to be dry despite that. The lamb managed to be even worse. The flavor could be summed up as turmeric, with a dash of turmeric. The heavy yellow color made it difficult to tell, but given the tough, sinewy (almost crunchy) texture, I'd say it was undercooked. I remember a fleeting thought that I'd get ill from it, and sure enough, within an hour, I was wishing I had Pepto in the car. One point off for two of three dishes being worse than mediocre, and an additional point off for inflicting food poisoning.Atmosphere: Awkward. The interior is essentially a cafeteria - columns of tables set up side by side, with a service line next to the grill. However, rather than having the low (or sometimes high) chatter of a cafeteria, the patrons were all very quiet, even couples and families with kids. It led to a strangely oppressive hushed feeling despite the dozens of people inside. I understand that this is probably not within the restaurant's control, but it's not pleasant, especially when waiting for food. One point off.Service: No issues with service. The guys working the grill and register were plenty friendly enough.Price: Neither good nor bad. I would've probably expected a dollar or so less per entry due to the atmosphere, but it doesn't put them out of the expected range.Given that it made me better acquainted with the bathroom, I think I'm being pretty generous."
"3.0","I really want to love this place, given how much I like Azorean / Portuguese food.  But I have to say that the food is mediocre.   The space is very nice.  I would come back for a coffee or beverage to hang out."
"3.0","Ordered and paid on Yelp. Very convenient. Good pizza. Ordered original crust/thin. Not the best or the worst I've ever had. Would eat it again if in the area."
"5.0","I've never gone & had a bad time. Decent bar food. Good draft selection. Great mixed drinks. As far as sports bars go, this is exactly what you would expect. It's spacious enough to never feel overcrowded while you enjoy a game. And the staff is amazing. Super friendly and they do their job well."
"5.0","I love this place. Their chicken with broccoli never disappoints, and their egg rolls are fried deliciousness on a plate. I have been coming here for almost 10 years (since I began working in town), and they have met my every need. Parking is a little dicey, and their seating during lunch is a little tight, but I've always been able to get in within my lunch hour.Great place!!"
"4.0","Enjoyed my food . Ordered vegetable curry it was good mixture of rice and vegetables i love it."
"4.0","Seat yourself in the back.... Only one server/bartender from 2-4:30 pm.... But good service regardless....fried ravioli was good.... Meatballs ok... Chicken rissoto was delicious....chicken eggplant parm was fried....( just to give a heads up)....lemon bar is very sweet( but good).  Carrot cake yummy....1 dessert is enough to feed 2!  Discounts for upmc family house guests..... It started raining and the manager offered to drive us back to family house when we asked to call a taxi... Great service for a good price.... Definately would recommend!"
"5.0","5 stars for sure I would give it 10 stars if I could! The flavors are so GOOD! Best Mediterranean / Middle Eastern food I have ever had the flavors in there food is out of this world!!This is a very casual place set up cafeteria style. You order and they bring out your food to you, self serve soda machines or bottles of soda and teas and waters.There is a market next door with spices and other food items and meat counter in the back of store.Free parking in there lot next to buildingI can`t wait to visit again!!I highly recommend this place it has delicious food!"
"3.0","I go here a lot for lunch. I like the specials, they are fun and creative. I wish they would incorporate seafood. I just got the pollo taco on a flour tortilla, and it was swimming it wet guacamole. But it's good for what it is. Decent place for lunch. Just would lighten up on the sauces."
"5.0","Turning fairly available material into a great dish, 'immortalizing the ingredients', that's what they do here at Kiku. If only comparing the dish names on menu to other Japanese places in town, not a big difference can be seen. But the freshness they keep in their food is just amazing. From sushi, sashimi to the fried tempura and the grilled shioyaki, they are all so fresh! That I believe, is the soul of Japanese food.Went with friends for the first time tonight. We had mixed tempura, shioyaki, chirashi sushi and the sushi lover for two. Everything was absolutely great except for the cucumber-tuna rolls, which mainly served as refreshment between great flavors (I used them the way as Japanese people use ginger). Entrees came with miso soup, which also tasted good. Price is okay regarding the type and quality of food, ~35 per person for us to get pretty full. Taken the fact its a Japanese restaurant, and such a good one, I really can't complain about anything."
"2.0","Definitely the worst Indian lunch buffet I've had in Pittsburgh. Selection is very limited and the taste is bland. And nearly $10. Only good thing is close location to UPMC and Pitt. If you have time, walk down to India Garden on Atwood."
"5.0","Their pork nachos are the best! I crave them so much and will get them at other places but nothing compares to them. At first I was not too sure because I am picky but boy was I wrong! They were a great size for me and my boyfriend ended up sharing them with me after he ate all of his tacos. The lady was so nice to us and kept checking on us as well. Defiantly will go back :)"
"3.0","I finally tried this place. Heard a lot of good things. First off the dishes don't match the rest of the decor. But then I got the good. I asked for medium rare and I got well done. So the burger wasn't that great. The mac n cheese was good but a bit too rich. The fried goat cheese was the best but still too much cheese made it too rich. I probably won't be back."
"4.0","Great prices, casual atmosphere, heavy pour on the cocktails, this place is a downtown staple.  Oh, delicious sandwiches and free popcorn."
"2.0","Used to be great.  For how pricey the food is, it lacks flavor.  Filet was over cooked, and definitely not worth the money.  Not sure if I will return."
"3.0","In my opinion, this place is a bit overrated and overpriced. I've heard very mixed things about this place, and after going in a couple of times for a happy hour I decided to get dinner one night. I didn't really know what to expect because the menu online listed dishes but no prices (as a side note: I HATE when restaurants do this!). I don't mind paying $15-20 for a good dish of food, but the quality of the pasta and sauces are totally average. I could boil a $1 box of pasta and $2 bottle of general marinara sauce at home and it wouldn't taste much worse than this food. It's definitely nice to go out for meals, particularly at a place like this that has such a well lit inside and a soothing vibe- however, I simply didn't think the quality of the food was good enough for the type of restaurant it strives to be. Furthermore, I found the people who work there to come off as a bit pretentious about the food and drink selections. In general, I would say the food and staff are a bit off putting and I wouldn't recommend this place to friends who have never been here before. However, if you go, definitely try the happy hour, which is one of the better ones in Pittsburgh *half off appetizers and drinks. Plus, wine is half off on Mondays and Wednesdays, which I would assume are their slower nights."
"4.0","I came here for dinner last night with a friend and it met my eager expectations - was not below/did not succeed, but definitely worth checking out! I have never had Japanese street food before so this was a great introduction to it. Between the two of us, we had the plain onigiri, the tuna onigiri, the takoyaki (essentially octopus fritters), nasu shigiyaki (japanese eggplant with chicken) and the chicken hearts cooked on the grill. The plain onigiri was pretty meh, I would probably suggest getting the tuna one as my friend thought his had a lot of flavor comparatively to mine. Both the takoyaki and nasu shigiyaki were really good! The takoyaki was crisp on the outside and more chewy on the inside served with shredded beets. The Nasu dish was simple, slightly sweet, but very good!As for chicken hearts - YOLO and go for it. If you get over the texture it's really not bad ;)Next time, I am definitely going to check out their drinks!"
"4.0","This is a regular stop of mine because I work on the strip in Pittsburgh. I want to share that I have probably eaten here 40+ times so I have tried about 10 hoagies on the menu. I went with the regular Steak and cheese hoagie- grilled onions, lettuce, tomato, mayo...add some hot sauce at the table, order of fresh cut fries and a drink. I get a work discount of 10% so anywhere you can eat lunch under $8 is awesome in any city.My only complaint is that occasionally the meat to bread ratio isn't too great. Don't get me wrong I'm not expecting 12 ounces of meat but it can be disappointing. I recommend one of the more creative sandwiches then. Though the breads here are so fresh and enjoyable."
"3.0","Overall disappointing.The good-Perogis -Brussel Spouts-The atmosphereThe bad-The burger-The chicken sandwich tasted waaayy burnt-The bill ended up being 65 for two people and we both left disappointed."
"4.0","Wednesdays is wings night for $13.99/person. About a dozen flavors to choose from and the wings are a good size. Great place to relax and watch a game."
"4.0","A really cool, fun spot for Japanese food! It's in a slightly hidden upstairs area with a nondescript entrance, and once you enter, the decor and dim lighting make you feel like you're in a different world. I liked this place because there's a little something for everyone, whether you want a fun cocktail, robata, sushi, or heartier Japanese food. We had a wide variety of dishes including he shrimp skewers ($2.50 each), salmon and yellowtail sashimi (very fresh!), the Nashu Shigiyaki (eggplant with ground chicken and other goodies on top - a bit salty from what I can remember), and a special of the night which was a messy but very flavorful and well-cooked short rib over rice. I washed all of this down with a cocktail called the 7 Day Vacation, which I no longer see on the cocktail menu online but I mostly chose because of the fun tiki glass presentation. It was pretty sweet and actually stronger than I expected (maybe because I downed it before the food actually arrived), but it came with a fun purple bendy straw so there's that! Coming from NYC restaurant prices I thought it was actually a pretty good value from start to finish, and the service was on point as well. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone with a jones for Japanese fusion dining."
"4.0","Excellent wings.  Just what I was looking for.  Buffalo hot sauce is right on the money. Blue cheese was great, wings skins were crispy. Great place to grab a beer, watch a game and feast on wings."
"5.0","This is my spot for breakfast and lunch sandwiches, a macaroni salad that's unparalleled, good coffee, great pastries, delicious ice cream and a super kind staff that is always a pleasure to give my business to. Small cafe, big hearted people."
"4.0","I've come to this place two times for music trivia on Wednesdays. It's a fun environment, with a draft special. It is $2 off all drafts during trivia. I had the mule, which was ok, but expensive. Would like to try the food sometime because it looks good. The bartenders are attentive and know what they're doing."
"5.0","I have been a customer of Cafe Raymond since conception. You have to be doing something right if you grew out of a smaller space into a larger one! The food that Ray prepares in his Cafe is 4 star quality. I would put his food on my table before some of the larger restaurants in the area. It does not matter what you order, you will never be disappointed. The food is amazing and the people are even better.One of the best things about this place has nothing to do with the menu. It that this family is from Pittsburgh. They worked their ass off to make their dreams come true. They have kids that are growing up in their cafe and learning more than a college education could provide. This is the American Dream, in our own YINZER backyard!  I make special trips to Cafe Raymond with my own family. The warmth and community that you feel the minute that you step inside is priceless. I can't even tell you enough about the food--you will have to try that for yourself.When in doubt, ALWAYS SUPPORT an Entrepreneur--especially one from Pittsburgh!"
"4.0","The Malai Kofta was delicious.  There are tons of vegetarian options.  Parking sucks in Oakland, especially at dinner time, but it was worth it to brave the hassle for such yummy food."
"5.0","Best lamb curry....this place is awesome... buffet style and delicious....every time we visit Pittsburgh we try and make a stop in at Salem's and they have the market attached with the super delicious chocolate candy with pistachio."
"5.0","Wonderful fusion place by the Strip District. Everything on the menu looked delicious and was! The Mahi Mahi tacos were made with fresh fish brought in from the local market and drizzled with a fun chipotle sauce. You can't go wrong with the chicken/shrimp poppers, make sure to try the wasabi dip or even better yet the buffalo sauce. I've been making buffalo sauce for years and haven't been able to get it to taste this good, perhaps the secret ingredient is mayo or thick butter.I got the idea to order the soft-shelled crab Bloody Mary from a fellow Yelper (thanks!) and noticed after it came to my table everyone around me started ordering the same thing. Other than being crazy and unique it was the best Blood Mary I've ever had. We'll be coming back here next time we visit Pittsburgh."
"5.0","This food is spot on!!! Super fresh. I had the bacon egg and cheddar on a croissant. Everything's was perfectly cooked, the croissant was so fresh. I'll be back!!!"
"5.0","This place made my favorite Pittsburgh burger spots!* Food: I occasionally get days where I crave a burger and the places I usually think of is Burgatory or BRGR. Although I love both those places, I wanted to try something new. I found this place on Yelp and thought I'd stop by. The menu was fun as it named burgers after neighboring towns. I got the Mexican War burger and wow was it good. If you love avocados in your burgers, I definitely suggest ordering this! All the burgers come with fries and I devoured that. The reason why I like this place more than others is that the burgers are more simple. In my opinion, other places stack their burgers with a bunch of ingredients and even though its good, I like more simple combinations. * Cost vs. Worth: Burgers are around $13 and you can also build your own which is around $10. It is worth every penny.Will I come here again? - YES! Their beers are also handcrafted so I definitely want to try it."
"5.0","Smoked gouda mac and cheese. Unreal. Also had the spare ribs. I ripped my last spare rib up and put it in the mac and cheese. Holy sheeyit. When you visit please order the spare ribs and rip them up into the mac and cheese. One of the best things i've ever eaten. Bartenders are also some of the best i've ever been around. Some insane views of the city just right up the street too. Come visit when you are in town."
"5.0","A really nice atmosphere, cool, chill place. I've gone both by myself for a couple of drinks and relaxing during the day, as well as with my fianc√© for a meal. It's a very satisfying place. The beer is delicious and the food is major comfort food it all the right ways. Really enjoy this place a lot."
"3.0","When you're talking fast food burgers, Hardee's probably has the best.  This location also offers some daily specials that make it an even better deal (sometimes it can feel a bit pricey).  Breakfast here is also a win when compared to other fast food options.  The place itself does have a bit of a dirty feel to it, though and the employees are mostly younger teens who are just there doing as little as possible.  The fries are nothing special.My suggestion?  Get a Thickburger to go."
"5.0","I'm from Atlanta and we have a lot of choices in Indian food.  This one ranks up high on the list for service and freshness. From the moment we were seated, our waiter was attentive, helpful and courteous!  We had great conversation and he made wonderful recommendations. The food was very, very good- we tried the different platters. The quantity could be a bit more. The chai was exceptional!  The decor is nothing special but I can let that go for the wonderful service.Next time I think we may try the buffet. A lot of the students ate from it and said good things. The choices looked good. Looking forward to going back!"
"5.0","There's almost no point in writing a review of this 5 star place. Every aspect of the dining experience is executed perfectly. It's a great steak restaurant with a limited menu, great wine list, excellent service, and attractive dining rooms. Of course you pay for all of those features with $$$$ prices, so Capital Grille is only for special occasions unless you're one of the elite. Our special dinner last night was excellent and we'll be back after the piggy bank is full again."
"3.0","Overpriced. Ribeye steak was just OK. Good service, although ma√Ætre d' was not the most welcoming. VERY loud (guy in the) bar."
"4.0","I'm impressed above and beyond at the follow-up given to my issues by Eat 'n Park! I received a phone call and invitation to come back and give them another try. We did, last night and everything was on point! They have won us back because everything was fresh, delicious and prepared exactly as  we asked. The server was excellent, courteous and friendly as well. This has always been a favorite spot for informal family dinners and will continue to be.  I applaud Eat'n Park management for the professional way they handled my complaint and how courteous  they were to me. Keep up the great work!!! We will definitely be back soon!!!"
"3.0","Cash only.The 'famous' corn beef hash was not great- and heavily salted.  Eggs were good.Not great food / not a lot of bang for the buck / 3.0 from me"
"5.0","Could not have had a better experience than we did at Jerome Bettis' Grille tonight. My friend and I were walking her dog along the North Shore and wanted to grab a drink somewhere. When we walked by, we asked the servers outside if we could bring our dog and they were so friendly and welcoming and made sure the dog was taken care of and brought water for him. The service was so great all around. We did go there later in the evening on a Friday night, but it wasn't even that busy and all the servers were so attentive to their tables and made time to connect with each of them (not in an annoying way) and have good conversations. Our server, Gabriel was fabulous and so engaging, he made great recommendations and hooked us up. The whole staff was phenomenal. My friend and I split the bill and Gabriel accidentally ran my card for both. We didn't realize until after the fact but just decided my friend would Venmo me her portion. A few minutes later the manager proactively came out and apologized for what happened and asked if she could fix it for us. It was honestly no big deal and something my friend and I could take care of our end but we definitely appreciated the offer and the desire to solve the problem without us even having to bring it to their attention. We had such a great night all around but a big shout out to Jerome Bettis' Grille for being the highlight."
"1.0","Service takes forever, food takes forever, not worth the wait. Got the chicken tikka masala, unlike any curry I've ever had. Creamy, salty, doesn't seem like any attempt at authenticity was made. A disappointing contribution to the lack of even semi decent Indian restaurants in the area. As"
"5.0","The seafood at this restaurant is truly second to none!!  I am impressed each and every visit! The Alaskan king crab is OUT OF THIS WORLD good.Our server, Drew, was undoubtedly the best waiter I have had thus far! His positive energy was radiating, which truly made our experience wonderful. Can't wait to come back!"
"2.0","Order took 20 minutes longer than the quoted time.  I got veggie biryani, prince onion and garlic naan, extra raita and prince salad. Veggie biryani... rice was over cooked. The only veggies are mushy peas, mushy carrots, and mushy potatoes. I asked for a 2 out of 5 spicy and it was VERY spicy. And I'm not a weakling when it comes to spice. Way over salted. Raita... I definitely didn't get extra. My biryani should have had some and then I spent $4 on extra. I only got 1 container. It also tasted very salty, somehow. Prince naan... this was the standout. Cooked well, lots of flavor. Very good. Salad... literally just lettuce, onion, tomato, and cucumber. Didn't see any peppers and didn't come with any dressing. Big big thumbs down."
"5.0","Great food really delicious. Would definitely recommend anyone to try it. Portions are well served. Was a bit hesitant because of the location. Very lonely and it looks sketchy. But overall very satisfied."
"5.0","Amazing. Was looking for a place for brunch before the Steelers game and was not disappointed by any means. The Brisket Hash was amazing (coming from a visiting Texan) and the Guys Breakfast, that blueberry ricotta pancake is easily top 5 of things I've had for breakfast, was delicious! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for great food!"
"1.0","This is what food poisoning looks like, had one piece of veal out of the three. I've had Marsala dishes hundreds of time, have made it myself and this is the worst Marsala meal I've ever had. It didn't taste like Marsala at all all I tasted was oil, as you can see in the pictures attached. They took off this one dish from my portion of the bill, but that doesn't help me with food poisoning... or the ruined night."
"4.0","Very good but not spectacular. Charming small place in 'Little Italy' Bloomfield. Usually can get seated any evening and this place has a nice assortment of menu choices.The 'senators peppers' which is an appetizer of sauteed peppers, garlic, EVOO, and tomatoes is really tasty and flavorful without being too spicy.This is a pick your pasta then pick you sauce kinda place. Service is fine. House salad dressing matches the greens perfectly.Alexanders is food allergy friendly and they have GLUTEN-FREE PASTA!But this is not an over-the-top place, but then again, the prices are not over top either.Recommended."
"5.0","The Fox Chapel Burger is the best burger I've ever had. Every time I'm here I want to get something different, but I just can't. The size of the burger is perfect, you can actually take a bite! Cheese fries are also getting a reputation in Lawrenceville because so many of us are addicted to them. The space is nice, service is quick and friendly. They also have a changing table in the men's & women's rooms which is great for all the families in the neighborhood."
"4.0","Solid food. We had the Fox Chapel and the Shadyside and they were both super tasty. Rosemary fries and Mac n cheese were both good as well. My biggest complaint is that at $13 each, I'd like to see more actual burger on the burger. With the Groupon voucher this place is a good value. Without the voucher, not so much."
"4.0","I had a wonderful breakfast at Pamela's. The food really is delicious, but quite expensive for breakfast! Our bill came to about $40 for 3 people. That's a lot of money for eggs and pancakes!!We were a little overwhelmed when we first arrived because the waiting area was packed. They told us only 10-15 mins and it was spot-on, which we were pleasantly surprised about! Our server came to us right away. I could immediately see how fast-paced they work to keep their customers flowing on a busy morning!Everyone in my group would agree that the best part of the meal was the lyonnaise potatoes. My friend recommended asking for the potatoes to be 'crispy' and I'm glad I did. They were absolutely delicious. A crunchy coating on top with soft potatoes and onions underneath. YUM.I ordered the Gail's eggs which were scrambled eggs topped with green onion and cream cheese. It came with a side of potatoes and two gigantic pieces of bread. The eggs were done perfectly and I although I had never had cream cheese on eggs before, it was delicious!! It's going to be hard to avoid cooking my eggs like that from now on! One of my friends ordered the breakfast special with 2 eggs, meat and a side of their specialty blueberry hotcakes. It falls somewhere between a crepe and a pancake. They cook a giant pancake and roll it up over a variety of fillings. It looks beautiful and tastes delicious! If it's too sweet to order for your whole meal, it's definitely worth ordering as a side for a few to split just to get a taste! My other friend ordered a daily special which was Chorizo hash served with eggs and tortillas. There was a surprising amount of meat and he was very pleased with his meal as well.The food is great and I was happy to finally experience this Pittsburgh gem. Prepare to pay more than your typical diner, but you certainly won't be disappointed by the quality!"
"5.0","Came back to my favorite breakfast place, it looks like they changed alot of things, menu and wall decor. I ordered mr green savory crepe, spinach and melted cheese topped with glaze and i also got nutella love that is very delicious, if ur looking for quite coffee shops its very good option in the mornings."
"5.0","This is my first review ever. While at work, we've tried a lot of places in Oakland. This has been my favorite pizza place in the 8 years I've worked here! We ordered hushpuppies, the BBQ chicken pizza and the Bianco pizza. The food was phenomenal, the delivery was fast and friendly. We will continue to order from here!"
"4.0","I love Arnold's and it's convenient location; the atmosphere is great. The coffee and other drinks I have had there are very good. Besides obviously being very overpriced, I am extremely frustrated with how long I have to wait to order. Others I have spoken with agree. The last few times, the cashier has taken at least 5 minutes per transaction and therefore I don't have time to get coffee. I have worked with a register most of my life, this shouldn't happen. If this is a technical issue with the register, pls get it fixed as you are losing business."
"5.0","Everything is solid but if you have an addictive personality, stay away from the hotcakes...they are ridiculous. Don't forget-CASH ONLY!"
"1.0","2/10 pizza.1/10 calzones. Would be passable as food if everything was 75% cheaper. Service was mediocre at best. Legitimately 15-20 other pizza/sub shops in the area that far surpass this dinky place. I do not know any reason I would ever think about coming back to 'little Nipper's'."
"5.0","We have been here several times and the pizza is awesome! We ordered the buffalo chicken, the Tuscan chicken, and have sampled the wings as well. Don't let the negative reviews fools you - his place has great pizza and wings."
"3.0","Average food- I feel the place was kinda hyped up more than the flavor of the burgers came out to be.  Kinda pricy for ok food. I tried the impossible burger (The one made to have the appearance of meat but made of veggies) and it was sweet and a little crumbly. I'll give it another try but probably not here. My other friend's  burgers also had oddly sweet notes to them which left them dissatisfied. Fires were ok. The fried goat cheese appetizer was sub par. If you want to do a custom burger it seems way more expensive than just sucking it up and getting one that they had on the menu. I might give this place a second try but it wasn't my favorite"
"3.0","I tried three tacos here. The corn tortillas were good but there needed to be more meat and veggies to fill the tacos! The meat was also quite dry. I ended up just making them into a make shift burrito. I was very disappointed in the spicy ground beef because there wasn't any spice! The chicken tasted like it was ground and, like the American, was just alright. The meat here simply isn't as flavorful as I would expect from a taco shop."
"3.0","I was really looking forward to my first visit to ChiKN. I had just read the recent New Yorker article on Nashville Hot Chicken and I had been a customer of Bird on Run since just after it opened. I will probably be back but I have to say that I like Bird on the Run a lot better. Never having been to Princes' in Nashville, I have no idea which of ChiKN or Bird on the Run is the most authentic. It probably doesn't matter. If I am in Oakland and want hot chicken it will be ChiKN. If I am not it will probably be Bird on the Run.The chicken sandwich was good. I ordered it medium and would not want to go any higher. It was pleasantly hot, with a bit of after burn. The chicken itself was moist and tasty. The crunchy outside was perhaps a bit salty...but who could say under all of that 'heat'. I did not care for the cole slaw."
"5.0","What can I say, this was the best Pizza and wings I've had in the city (downtown).  Delivery was fast and everything was HOT!  Bravo!"
"1.0","We come to Pittsburgh once a year and always come to Jerome's.  Over the last few year there has definitely been an overall decline in service.  We arrived as a party of 4 around 730. We were told it would be a 90 minute wait. We expected that.  We ordered drinks at the bar and went outside to enjoy the fresh air.  At 9 pm I thought I would go check at the hostess desk as to our status on the waitlist.  No hostess and what's worse....no more list.  A pleasant employee came by and seemed to be helping others get tables, so I asked him if we were still on a list. He just asked how many we were and got us to a table.  However he never notified the server we were there. 10 more minutes before we saw the server. We order drinks dinner and appetizers.   Drinks came after a little wait.  Meanwhile guests are still being seated.  Now its almost 10 pm.  And finally our appetizers come out.  Cold!  We were so hungry we ate them.  For the record the Asian shrimp and buffalo wings were tasty but would have been better if they were served hot and timely.  So as 1030 approaches and guests that were sat after us have finished their food a kitchen person comes out and says our ticket got all messed up and could we give her our order again. Promises it will be out in 5 minutes.  15 more minutes and I finally had it.  Got up and told server we couldn't take the waiting anymore.  At that moment food finally came out to our table so we sat back down and  ate.  My hisbands hamburger bun was hard as rock and inedible. My nachos were fair.  Salad with salmon was ok and other burger was decent. Not once did a manager ever come over and apologize.  Our server was nice and we felt bad for him.  Our meal was comped so we tipped the server and pretty much will never go back.  The server did tell us that the table that was next to us and left due to the wait was betis' cousins.I do hope they say something to the powers that be. It's a shame to see this place go downhill."
"1.0","This is the most ridiculously disgusting food I have had in a while. I ordered a Madras Masala Dosa and they used the potato stuffing of dosa in my other order of poori bajji. Aweful taste and nothing authentic. Staff is lazy. Avoid like plague."
"5.0","Amazing pizza and good customer service. I would suggest this to anyone. The pizza I got was a bbq chicken Pitt pizza. Dang what a great for my stomach. Food prices are very low considering the area I'm in. If you like variety and pizza this is the place to give a shot."
"3.0","The restaurant is pretty clean and the employees are friendly. Overall, the service was mediocre because I got a pager for my food because I was dining in, yet it never buzzed. After 15-20 minutes, I checked the counter and my food was there... I felt like they should've paged me another time if they saw that I didn't come to pick up my food. The food was average- the mac&cheese was very rich and the BBQ chicken flatbread was very drippy (sauce kept on dropping out). Overall, a decent meal, but in my eyes it's overpriced for the amount of food you get."
"1.0","I've tried the breakfast food in this place twice and been disappointed both times.  First visit:  Tried to enter this place at 8:15am,  15 minutes after they open - the door was locked.  Took about 5 minutes of knocking to get someone's attention to open the door.   Ordered a sausage, egg, and cheese bagel sandwich to go.   Upon unwrapping the sandwich and beginning to eat,  I noticed the egg was essentially a fragile lump of undercooked scrambled egg.  So the sandwich disintegrated rapidly every time you took a bite. It was quite messy.  Also the cheese they used tasted like one of those individually wrapped slices of fake cheese you buy in the supermarket when you are on a low budget.  After I paid,  I asked the woman at the counter how business was going.  She replied gloomily that the Starbucks down the street takes all of their morning business.  Second visit, a month later:  Walked through the door at 8:15 (this time the door was open) and the woman behind the counter (a different one this time) seemed literally shocked to see a customer...  I asked if they had any muffins.  She pointed out three cupcake-sized blueberry muffins in wax paper.   I bought one only because I hadn't eaten yet and needed to grab something and run.   The undersized muffin was half-stale and cost $2.    These muffins look like what you buy at Costco in bulk at low prices - not what you would expect from a cafe..  Yeah... Starbucks is their problem...Meanwhile,  all summer long,  just a few doors away from them there is a huge construction project with dozens of hungry construction workers...  I walk by this cafe everyday and have never seen a construction worker go in or out of this place."
"5.0","We went to this cafe for the breakfast. We like everything here. Food is delicious. Decoration is unique. Very good service. Definitely coming back again."
"5.0","Great beer and great staff and service! We didn't try the burgers, just stopped in front f the beers and WOW, the beer is on point!  They also have paper straws and boxes which is a huge plus for eco-friendly patrons such as myself.  Will definitely be back to try the food on our next trip to PGH"
"5.0","It's absolutely my favorite bar in the entire city. The coolest atmosphere. They have delightful cocktails. Bartenders are knowledgeable and super friendly. Kitchen open until midnight and they have really really good food. Best Moscow mule and old fashioned in the city"
"4.0","I would have given Umami 5 starts if they hadn't replaced the default traditional sauce that accompanies Karaage (fried chicken) with a horrible Applebees-esque Aioli concoction.  They will still serve this delicious chicken with the traditional sauce, but you have to ask for it in advance."
"3.0","Nothing kicks off my weekend better than a burger. Burgh'ers is very new compared to other burger joints around the city. They offer a variety of signature burgers, but they also provide a build-your-own option which was what I went for. All their burgers come with a side of fries or side salad. I ordered the veggie burger on a lettuce wrap with cream cheese, caramelized onions, cole slaw, and topped with their special sauce which is similar to a thousand island. They offer some unique toppings and yes, I made it my mission to create the weirdest combo which, surprisingly, didn't turn out too bad! Warning for anyone getting cream cheese, they don't just spread it on. They give you a huge slab of it so approach with caution. My biggest complaint is that the veggie patty itself is VERY salty and not as full as others I've had like Burgatory or BRGR. Not very impressed.I was a huge fan of the restaurant atmosphere. Very open and bright with large windows along the walls. It has a modern industrial vibe with the metal chairs and exposed hvac ducts. Chill and casual for a nice lunch or dinner.Service was great throughout our visit. The waiters punch in your order as you tell them what you want which makes the process so much more efficient. Anything to get my food faster!"
"1.0","My friend and I received the exact same fraudulent charge on our credit cards after being at The Summit Saturday evening. We both had the same bartender, as well. Coincidence? I'm gonna say NO! Drink there at your own risk. DISGUSTED."
"4.0","A return visit last night was quite good. I had the Thai Kung Pao, and it was delicious, but it requires a warning: err on the low side of the heat scale when the waitress asks. I asked for 5 out of 10, foolishly, and the food was too spicy. I recommend asking for about a 3."
"3.0","Been here several times before more recently went with my boyfriend because it was his first time going. We ordered an appetizer I believe it was shrimp I don't have a picture but it was really good it came on a bed of lettuce which was great. I have pictures of what we ordered the service was good the food was much tastier this time than it has ever been before in the past. I would say the menu was not extraordinary but for what it is it's okay"
"4.0","Huge!  Convenient, friendly and with WiFi. Plenty of parking. And unbeatable for a good - and healthy breakfast. Probably the healthiest lunch menu out of all the 'fast food' chains. And despite the crowds, it's clean and airy."
"4.0","I had the Club sandwhich when I went here. The sandwhich was well balanced and I especially liked the guacamole and chipotle aioli they included on the sandwhich which is unlike the traditional club. My meal did take an abnormally long time to come out despite it being a simple sandwhich. I think this might have been attributed to how busy this place was considering it was a weekend afternoon. Overall I loved this place and the food so I will definitely be coming back and would get the same thing again."
"5.0","This is THE BEST Chinese food on the Eastern half of the USA! The egg rolls are to die for, literally!  I have been in Chinatowne of NYC, Washington, DC, San Francisco and others...no where has fresh authentic Chinese food like  The Chinatowne Inn on Third Ave, Downtown Pittsburgh.  I have brought people here to eat that have been in top Chinese restaurants of the aforementioned cities and others. They agree after they eat here!"
"1.0","This steak arugula was more arugula than steak and they gave me a baguette with a bite out of it. However in the end it didn't matter that the food at this Panera was shit because I threw it all up an hour later"
"2.0","I have been for their lunch buffet a few times, and I do really like Indian food and I want to like this place, but here is how I feel about it. The goodDecent selection, relatively clean, and I think $10 with Pitt Id. is a fair price.The BadThe food wasn't awful, but it isn't that good either, bland but eatable, the items are almost the same everyday I have been there. Two of the waiters were one of the rudest I have seen (there is one guy who is actually nice), and its almost as if they don't want you to go there."
"3.0","#1 problem - they serve water in tiny plastic water bottles. I asked why - thinking it was to do with the water situation yesterday, but no - it's there normal way of serving water. It's extremely wasteful and I was actually offended at the disregard for our environment. I had to ask for a glass of water. Oh just read a review saying they charge 50 cents for a bottle??It took a while for someone to take our order, but our food came quickly. One a side note - the music was really loud in the front area. It was nicely decorated! My boyfriend liked the omelette so that's good. I ordered their homemade iced tea and was disappointed that there seemed to be mint in it. It was not enjoyable to someone who hates mint and was a waste of $3. Lucky for my boyfriend because he enjoyed it.I ordered a sweet strawberry Nutella crepe. It was a folded crepe drizzled with the tiniest amount of Nutella and a few cut strawberries. You are supposed to slather the folds with Nutella and stuff it full with strawberries! Despite ordering a strawberry crepe, there were blueberries on top. I HATE blueberries and I felt bad wasting them. It's worth trying if you aren't as picky and easily annoyed as me. My boyfriend would go back, but I'll pass and save my money."
"1.0","I will not be going back to this awful place unless forced. Even then, I will probably have to be searched by one of their rude bouncers because I will, indeed, have a flask on me. Rooftops, i get why they are so popular. After spending all day inside, basking in the sun on beautiful day is a great way to revitalize yourself and upping your vitamin D. I would rather hang out in a basement with the lights off than go back to Il Tetto. I am sad about it, as I really enjoy Sienna on the Square and even Sienna Mercato downstairs. The appetizers at Il Tetto are sad, overpriced and not worth it. Marinated olives are $10 and not worth it. The beef tartare tastes like bacon and is a million dollars without even mentioning what kind of beef is used. The atmosphere also lacks anything worth while. The sun was shining the other day but the rooftop bar doesn't seem to let a lot of sun in with different sheets hanging across the rooftop. It was also far too crowded to be enjoyed. The atmosphere could have been appreciated a lot more if it wasn't so packed. I understand that restaurants want to make money and people equal money. But the key is to make people want to come back. My entire party of 10 will not be coming back."
"5.0","Fine dining at Smallman Galley.  Wonderful Chicken Paprika with cream sauce .  I could have paid way more for this dish at another restaurant."
"2.0","Love love love burghers in zelienople. Burgers were noticeably different and not in a good way. DRYDisappointed, we were all very excited to have our favorite burger joint closer to workThe executive chef needs to ensure consistency to both locations. When I got to a chain the food should be the same."
"3.0","Had a calzone. Food was pretty good... The reason for the three stars was that it says on the website $10 minimum order. My calzone was about $14. When I was giving my information over the phone, the guy never gave me the total but I wasn't expecting to pay $19.81 for a calzone. Absolutely ridiculous... Come to find out when I got my bill that they charged me $3.00 for delivery, $2.00 in taxes and then an .80 cents service charge... This place is like highway robbery."
"3.0","Another V3 Flatbread opened.  The ideas is a fast casual pizza shop were you create your own pizza in a cafeteria line like Subway, Chipotle or some of the new pizza shops opening up.  You get as many toppings as you want for $8.  My pizza crust was overcooked, to hard and very crunchy and had no real taste.  Some of the topping were a little burnt, not the way I prefer.  The do have a couple of salad choices to. This location has limited seating at some high tables.  V3 is owned by the owner of Vocelli's Pizza."
"5.0","Wow!  This was a great find.  The food is fresh and very tasty.  Nice veggie option.  Staff was very friendly."
"4.0","Good pizza, crust is delicious!! Not sure if I was just really hungry or not. Good fries and a good amount. Recommend post concert or if youre just really hungry."
"5.0","What a gem! Cute cozy cafe feel with delicious fresh food. Greater as soon as I walked in. I selected a yummy chai tea latte and fresh berry French toast. Neither disappointed. French toast was fresh, perfectly toasted. The toppings were fresh, flavorful and delicious. I can't wait to go back, so many other yummy items on the menu I need to try!"
"5.0","I order from here all the time, excellent service and food. Food is hot so be aware I get a 4 out of 10 and it's still spicy, delicious always tho!"
"4.0","This was one of the better fast food meals I've had. My husband and I both had the $4 meal: a double cheeseburger, spicy chicken sandwich, fries, and drink for 4 bucks. The man working the counter was about 1000 times more friendly and competent than at most fast food joints. They have a ton of fountain drink choices. Also, they bring the food to your table for dining in which is nice, so you're not awkwardly lingering by the counter. All of the food was hot, fresh, and tasty. Plus, a very clean restroom. Wish there were more Hardee's around Pittsburgh, and I'll definitely return to this one!"
"5.0","We've been to many different bakeries and theirs is very authentic. I've been to France four times and they offer the same beautiful and delicious pastries you'd find there for a reasonable price. We've tried several things there since they've opened. My family loves the butter and almond croissants. My husband and I love the pan au chocolate. Ah-mazing! This past time we tried the Black Forrest Cake, which was good. We loved the cherry inside. We had a little chocolate flourless cake too, which was also very good. The little bag of Madeleines were good too. Macarons are always good. We try different types every time we go. It's fun to try new flavors. There are so many different pastries to try. Go check it out if you want to try different types of authentic French pastries. It's exciting they have so many different locations across town. Can't wait to try the one downtown. We love visiting the Lawrenceville location."
"5.0","Food was fantastic! I came in with my GF for date night on a Friday evening. The place was not too packed I ordered the steel city lobster roll and It was on point. Shout out to Kevin our server for the excellent service! I definitely recommend this place!"
"4.0","Late night pepperoni pizza , and we were very pleasantly surprised. Good cheese, good sauce - yum! We would definitely come back."
"4.0","I was pleasantly surprised that they actually brewed their own beer on site.  And it was only $4.00 a pint on a Saturday night!  We were feeling like indulging in a burger and a brew and thought what better place to try than here.  When we first arrived we were seated in the dining area, which honestly it's just one big area, but nevertheless it was at a two top table.  I was a little disappointed that our hostess sat us and didn't give us a beer menu or explained how the food menu worked.  We sat for some time.  With no server in site, and minutes ticking by.  I was tired of waiting and got up to see if any seats had opened up at the bar since we arrived.  Sure enough there were a few and I quickly grabbed my stuff and headed to the bar where we were greeted by a great bartender.  He promptly took our drink order.  They had a pretty decent N.E. IPA on tap, and at the $4.00 price tag, it was a definite score.  Next we ordered our burgers.  I was in between three options, Maggie's Farm, Fox Chapel, and the Animal.  The animal caught my eye with the addition of basil and jalapeno.  It also came with cream cheese and tomato.  You can get fries or a mixed greens salad for which I chose the latter.  My other half chose the Maggie's Farm burger and fries.  When our food came out I couldn't help but notice the slice of cream cheese on top of my burger.  It was massively cut, terribly excessive and such a waste.  I smeared off 97% of it.   After the cheese was under control the burger tasted very fresh but the toppings didn't bring as much flavor to the party as I thought they would.  On the contrary, I tried the Maggie's Farm burger and wished I had went that route.  It had a nice spicy kick to it.  Mine was good, but the cold, thick cream cheese wasn't the best topping for this burger.  One thing we noticed as the time ticked closer to closing time is that people were still coming in, were still ordering food, and still getting drinks.  I think the 10 pm closing time is merely a suggestion.  Overall the bar experience was very nice and the burger was good though the execution of the burger fell a little short."
"1.0","This is easily the worst pizza I have ever eaten in my life.  I ordered 2 slices.  Rialto 'heated' them (read: practically burnt to a crisp) so much that the cheese hardened to the point that it literally chipped off when I attempted to eat it.  How does cheese that is supposed to be melted manage to chip off?  The crust was so dry and crunchy, I'm surprised I didn't lacerate my throat trying to eat it.  Not to mention that the cost of 2 slices was more expensive than an entire 4-cut personal pizza.  Will NEVER go there again."
"5.0","This is such a hidden gem on E. Ohio Street. I love the relaxed, rustic, inviting atmosphere. They have so many flavors of tea that will make you come back for more. When I came I got a Pear Arugula Salad. It was incredible. The champagne pear vinaigrette dressing was like icing on a cake. It was honestly the most exciting salad I've ever eaten-- and let's face it, salads are kind of boring."
"3.0","I think this is a nice addition to Mt. Washington. I live right down the street, and this place is always packed.For me, the best part of The Summit is the atmosphere. I love how they open all the windows, and it's always just a cool place to be. However, I do think their drinks and food are a bit overpriced. Everything I've tried is good, but because of the prices, I'm more likely to choose somewhere else on Mt. Washington."
"1.0","Why did I even go back!!!  Thought I would give it a try since the service last three times was terrible.  It actually got worse.   We were seated upstairs and after 15 minutes were waited on.  Our taco salads came pretty quickly.    No dressing. 15 minutes for dressing as it comes from downstairs.   The server went down to get it and came back with one. He said he had the other but wanted to bring them together!!!  Seriously?   So you held one to upset us both?   The server spoke with a so called manager named Chris who didn't even bother to come to the table but took 1.90 off the salad.   LOL!!!    The server said Chris was too busy to see us.  Do yourself a favor and do not go there for lunch.   I should have just given 11 dollars to the homeless guy sitting in front of the restaurant."
"4.0","Love the pie, though I'm a little under-impressed with the white pizza. Like that they offer other food besides pizza. And not to mention you can grab a 6-pack!"

"3.0","A-mazing chicken schwarma. The best. Their naan is also very good. Loved the cafeteria setting and enjoyed walking through the market.Only bad part: the parking lot beside the building is tight. Someone parked us in. Next time, I would look for street parking.Next time I go to Salem's I will be sampling the yummy looking middle eastern desserts."
"1.0","The new restaurant just opened recently. We were very disappointed. My breakfast included runny eggs (ordered over easy), cold toast, under cooked potatoes.... not very good."
"5.0","This brewery is one of my favorites in Pittsburgh. Even if you don't like beer, the restaurant is beautiful, the staff are all so nice and THE FOOD IS INCREDIBLE. I've been here several times, and each time I left wanting to go back. Try the oatmeal cookie, it will change your life."
"5.0","Great Chicken and good portions! I discovered this shop in Yelp after seeing Popeyes was closed and CHiKN was just around the corner. I ordered the 3 piece chicken tenders with a mild spice level and it was a decent portion size! I was definitely full by the end of my meal. The tenders were seasoned to perfection and the fries were good and warm. I am not a spicy person but the mild was just right for me and I probably could have gone up a spice level for an added kick. Service was pretty quick and the prices were reasonable in my opinion. Highly recommend if you are looking to try a new spot in Oakland other than the major chain spots."
"3.0","My kids make this a must stop when we're visiting Pittsburgh. The staff are friendly and the food was great and greasy! We ordered the 'Big Nate', 'The 7' and 'Pitisburgher.' We will definitely stop by again when in town. Unfortunately, I had to take 1 star away for the cleanliness of the tables and floor."
"5.0","Took a Yelp suggestion and gave this place a try ! We had the Pickle Brine fried chicken sandwich and a Mexican War burger.Yowza it was good stuff!! Thanks Yelp!!"
"4.0","Moving to Brighton Heights after living in Squirrel Hill, and Oakland and Monroeville before that, one of the main things I miss is great pizza. We've ordered from a bunch of places around Northside and Bellevue and they have all been super disappointing. The only place we've liked so far has been Wiseguys. The crust is thin and very crispy, even after being refrigerated, and the sauce is plentiful and well-seasoned. The sausage is mild, which I liked (perfect cold breakfast pizza!) but my husband wasn't impressed with it. Great price for the extra-large Don with coupons from the Pennysaver. It can't compare with my Squirrel Hill favorites, but if I want delivery, it will probably be from Wiseguys."
"5.0","Awesome craft drinks, and these bartenders know their stuff!  The happy hour prices are reasonable."
"2.0","We came here for happy hour on a weekday. Service is subpar (it took almost 20-30 minutes to get a server's attention), then they never checked back on us. I say 'they' because noone was actually assigned to us and they acted like they could care less. Good beer & draft selection, typical bar food/apps. If it wasn't for the really open atmosphere and roof top, I'd otherwise pass on Il Tetto and go elsewhere."
"5.0","My go-to Chinese food in Pittsburgh. I've never been disappointed in my many meals. I often call in and get to-go food, and the nice ladies that work the phones/front counter/cash register are always friendly, greet you with a smile, straight to business, and usually don't have to ask, they remember me & load me up with plastic silverware plates, & napkins. Their restaurant is always clean, has a small bar area with booth seating, and the other section has more of a fine dining atmosphere. They serve you hot delicious tea and ice water upon sitting down.If ordering delivery, they only deliver downtown during lunch hours because they deliver via bicycle. I compared the price when ordering delivery via yelp & foodler & foodler was cheaper (& also - that's a middle man to Meals Delivered - but I like my foodler points/convert to $).The usually offer a coupon on their website."
"4.0","Very solid location for lunch or late breakfast. I order from here on the go on a semi regular basis. Good salads, good sandwiches, and above all - quality food. Placed right in the heart of the strip district this place makes the best BLT I've had around the city."
"4.0","Terrific food and a great location. I attended a rooftop reception there, sponsored by Pittsburgh powerhouse Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney, and had a GREAT time! The restaurant on the street level was packed and the staff was friendly and responsive. Seems like a really popular place, even on a Wednesday night! I'll definitely be back!"
"5.0","Best Chinese I have got to have in Pittsburgh till date. Loved their pork friend rice and Kung pao chicken . Very friendly staff. Can't wait to go again!"
"5.0","This place is consistently providing amazing food and fantastic service. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for some delicious burgers and fries. Much better than any chain restaurant out there. Keep up the good work, Burgh'ers!!"
"5.0","WOW!I am not even joking, the blueberry ricotta pancakes were the best pancakes of my life. Not gonna lie, the ricotta kind of scared me at first because I didn't want cheesy pancakes. But it made the texture of the pancakes SO FLUFFY! It was almost creamy actually. You can't really taste the cheese because it is so blueberry-y but not overly sweet. A must get.And I got an omelet. It was also SO FLUFFY! It was super thick- almost like an egg cake/souffle type dish. I had it filled with bacon, swiss cheese, and mushrooms and was pleasantly surprised because it wasn't too salty. Just perfect. Definitely come here if you're ever in Pittsburgh! Make sure to get here kind of early too because it gets very busy!"
"4.0","There are a few obstacles to getting into Umami, including finding the door (follow the lanterns up the stairs and keep climbing!) and getting past the frosty hosting staff, but make the effort and you're on your way to an awesome experience! The maguro was deliciously spicy and the suzuki was succulent! The yuzu deviled eggs are also a fine addition to your dining experience as is the takoyaki, with both being presented beautifully by a great wait staff. There are always fantastic specials and it's great to watch the sushi chef slice and dice at the bar with an ambience on par with the high quality of food, beer and wine! The chirashi is also a standout of mixed sushi selections! The staff does a great job of describing the sushi and fresh fish being delivered to the table and the presentations are really quite ornate! Enjoy!"
"1.0","The food is par. the personal service has much to be desired, which taints the quality of average food. Don't disrespect me on the phone, nor on delivery. Not my fault you only do cash tips"
"5.0","It's not Nashville hot but it's HOT. One of our favorite chicken spots in Pittsburgh for sure!"
"3.0","Good, but not great.  Service was not good at all.We had a family Christmas outing with dinner and a show.  The Capital Grille was the family's first choice as we had always had a good experience with past visits to CG.We were seated promptly upon arriving and then proceeded to wait 15 minutes for ANYONE to stop at the table.  Other tables were being sat and served and we sat and sat and sat.  When we finally ordered drinks and they were served, we let the server know that we had a 7 p.m. show to attend and that we needed to pick up the pace.  No response and service lagged on.....To make a long story short, the food was wonderful, as usual, but the service made the experience a poor one.  We had zero time for coffee or dessert and barely made the show.You would think when someone makes a 5 pm reservation on a Saturday evening the staff would realize that you have to be somewhere for a show.A usually good 'go-to' place in town was very, very disappointing....."
"4.0","Despite the fact that it always riddled with undergrads, this is a pretty solid Panera. The food is good, the employees are pleasant, and my order has always been correct. You can expect to wait in line at all hours, but they move through the line pretty quickly. I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars because Panera is so overpriced, but I do find myself here more than is good for my wallet because of the soup and salad varieties."
"3.0","It's very average to me. I came here two or three times so far, and every time it is because nothing opens on a Sunday in downtown Pittsburgh. I think I ordered general tsao chicken once and lemon chicken another time. I like the general tsao chicken but the lemon chicken was so bad, I have had lemon chicken back in Taiwan. It is nothing like this, I never NOT finish my food, but I didn't finish my lemon chicken here. The service is good though, and the complimentary fried wonton is what keeps me coming back on a Sunday to be honest. :p"
"5.0","Don't go to DeLuca's. It's highly overrated, but Raymond's excellent.  Unique way of ordering and seating and food to table really moves the line along. Staff is very friendly. The blueberry pancakes were excellent. Omelette special was delicious."
"2.0","On Mother's Day, I went to capital grille for dinner with my family. The food and drinks that was served was great and we were all very satisfied. On our way out, we realized that all the mothers that were there got flowers, but myself and another woman did not. This was very discouraging for me, and it is a shame to make it a social issue, but it seemed like the only few people who were excluded were racially diverse. I even spoke to an employee after leaving the restaurant to confirm if flowers were supposed to be given to everyone and he did say it was supposed to be given to all mothers. Although the food and drinks were great, the service was very unsatisfactory unfortunately. For as much money you put in, you expect good hospitality in return."
"4.0","Came here because of the cutest umbrella decor and it turned out to be just as exciting as we anticipated! Caffe Mona has both indoor and outdoor seating, but make sure you come on a sunny day to enjoy the outdoor back patio. The umbrellas do an amazing job at keeping it cool. As well, the location is not in a busy area, so despite being outside it is still extremely peaceful. Such a nice change up from similar restaurants in lawrenceville or southside. As for the food, it was so delicious! Service was fast and attentive. Overall, a very relaxed atmosphere. They have a very unique style with their restaurant that remains true to their business. They even bring the checks in a wooden box...such a cute touch! We will absolutely be back!"
"5.0","I am ashamed it took me this long to finally try Umami. This one truly lives up to the hype.Finding it was the tough part. The doors weren't clearly labeled so I felt like I was about to barge into someone's living room. Once we finally navigated our way up to the restaurant, we were seated at the bar because the space is sooo limited plus we were there on a Saturday night with no reservation - oops. Vegetarian items are all clearly labeled which was a huge help considering I had no idea what half the ingredients listed were. It could've been a fish or a mushroom - no clue. I ordered the vegetarian rice ball (onigiri) because I've never tried one and it looked pretty darn good in Pok√©mon. Either I was was being a huge baffoon or it was poorly made because it fell apart as soon as I tried to eat it. It was delicious but it could've used more filling. For my main entree, I ordered the donburi with tofu and it was incredible. Huge portion and packed with so many toppings and flavors. They were a little too heavy handed with the sauce which was overbearing at times, but otherwise, it was amazing. 100% recommend!"
"4.0","HAPPY HOUR for the WIN! Best happy hour around. $6 strong, crafted, creative drinks. Discounted prices for food. Board games. Garage Doors. Fun atmosphere. You can't go wrong with The Summit during their 5-7PM M-F happy hour!"
"4.0","What an awesome surprise! No wait here on Friday at 8 pm, when there were lines out the door at Piccolo and Driftwood. Nervous it might be a bad sign, but not at all. We were seated immediately and the service and food were really good!We took advantage of the $5 Faber Friday special - the gin is especially good. Love to see local beers and spirits represented on the menu, as well as a few of my favorites central PA ciders - Jack's and Wyndridge Farms. I got the Morningside burger (again, if you read my reviews, if there's an opportunity to put an egg on a burger, I'm going to take it) and B built his own (basic bitch) burger.  Love the potato roll. The fries (I got the rosemary ones) were fantastic. I ordered my burger medium rare and the egg over medium. The burger was rare and the egg was over easy. I like both things that way too, so it was no big deal. Thankfully B's burger was well done, as he requested, because he's definitely more particular than I am (as are most people!)Service was prompt. Dining room was pretty loud, despite not being full. Food was solid. Spent about $50 for two people, two rounds of drinks that were on special. Definitely recommend this place and look forward to getting back myself to try to the macaroni and cheese, chicken sandwich, and a cocktail or two."
"5.0","Not enough stars to rate this place !!!! Great food, serve and atmosphere. I had the Protein 9 omelette and a Chia Tea Latte. Absolutely delicious. You have to check them out. You wont regret it"
"5.0","Words cannot describe this place. Everything from the ambiance to the food to the workers is absolutely amazing. We stumbled in here right after a concert because we were craving some ramen and oh man did this place deliver. The ramen was to die for! I will for sure be coming back to try everything else."
"2.0","We didn't get to eat here, or even grab a drink for that matter (hence the two stars), but we did get to experience the service... And I wanted to write about it because it was the ultimate disappointment.  Almost terrible enough to warrant one star, but I feel like since we didn't get to eat or drink, I would try to be fair.  Service is the one thing that will keep me coming back, even if the food or drinks are nothing to write home about. We decided to venture in here one day, and it was not insanely busy. A decent sizes crowd but nothing insane with waits or anything.  We were first rudely cut in front of immediately in front of the host stand.  Bad experience part one.  They saw what happened, and even though the person brought meatballs from downstairs which you aren't supposed to do from what I heard them telling her, they still seated the rude lady first.  Finally, someone takes us to a seat... Where we wait, and wait and wait and aren't even greeted by a server.  We waited long enough.  We had seen servers greeting ppl who were seated long after us, but somehow, our little area was being ignored. Being hungry, and annoyed, I decided it was not a place I wanted to spend my money and left.  I won't be back to the rooftop there... Thankfully our experiences at Emporio have been better, so we will at least go there."
"3.0","I love the Steelers and love the Bus!!! We had lunch here before a Monday night game and the atmosphere was awesome! The service was good, the food was average and the prices were okay. As a lifelong Steelers fan making my first trip to Pittsburgh from the west coast, Jerome Bettis' Grille 36 was worth a visit just for the proximity to the game and the atmosphere. I would not recommend a second visit though. The food is comparable to an Applebee's  or Chili's or some other large chain restaurant, not bad but nothing special. Go for the experience, not for the menu."
"5.0","Amazing food.Big PortionsGreat service"
"3.0","Not my favorite lunch spot with my dietary preferences. But their menu is always changing so may be there will be more vegetarian friendly options in the future. I do love the spacious back room with lots of natural light. I also love they partner with other local small businesses on what food and drinks they offer e.g. Arsenal cider and Driftwood oven bread."
"1.0","You will never find a worse Taco Bell in the entire world.... Every single order is ALWAYS messed up, cashier has no idea what she's doing as she cannot even simply type orders in correctly. It is so slow, you'll be waiting for at least 20 mins so if you don't have time to wait for a messed up order, consider choosing another establishment. Would rate this a ZERO but that's not an option. Never go here."
"4.0","Found this place on yelp,  and glad I did.  Had several small plates and bites.  The pork dumplings were delicious!  These are a must have! The crispy brussel sprouts are also a must...delicious and unexpected.  Enjoyed the mussels but the butter sauce was a bit flavorless. The French fries were perfectly done.  Several sauces to choose from. I had the garlic aoli.  They have a good beer menu and a nice specialty cocktail menu,  but I have seen better.  Food and drink aside,  the atmosphere was relaxed and perfect for dining and conversation.  Loved that there is no TV.  Will go back when the weather is nice and the garage doors can be opened."
"5.0","First time at Grille 36 and the food was great and a great place to watch sports. Our server George gave us plenty of great recommendations and was a great server! I'll definitely be coming back to this place for food and drinks!"
"5.0","Excellent prices for quality, fresh food. The food was very flavorful and the coffee was delicious. If you like spice, try the hot sauce!"
"4.0","Came here on a Pirates game day about 2 hours before the game. Luckily we found some seats at the bar to eat & drink( the wait for a table was over a hour). We ordered a few appetizers and beers. It only took about 15-20 min to get our food, I thought much longer since their wait was so long. Our waitress was on top of everything, our glasses never were empty. Food was aright, pretzel sticks were AMAZING, get those if you're getting a app. The bones less wings- are really not wings, but chicken tenders with wing sauce. Buffalo chicken flat bread was good. THEY HAVE BANANA BREAD BEER!!! GET IT! The inside of the restaurant is obviously sports themed. LOUD atmosphere, there were children there, it's family friendly if you want to bring your kid to a bar.  Bathrooms are ok, little dark."
"5.0","So I just realised freshii was opened and have eaten there to days in a row... I absolutely love the menu and everything I have has has been excellent!!! I totally recommend the Baja burrito my current favorite but I still have a lot to try!!!"
"3.0","I'm always in the look out for Japanese food when i travel. This place is located in a shopping center and kinda had a hard time looking for it. The place was pretty quite, there was myself at a table and another at the sushi. I ordered the super combo which consisted of some sushi, teriyaki, tempura rolls all for $27 bucks. The food was ok and thought that they could of gave more for that same price.  The service was ok since i was the only one there so i can't complain."
"5.0","Pamela's is a breakfast staple in the Pittsburgh area since 1980. They have about 3 restaurants in the area and you can expect lines especially on the weekends. I remember being at the Shady side location when I was about 12 and looking around at every one's plates. The portions were ginormous!! Even when I went last week the portions were still giant, though I had grown a good bit. I love their staple of amazing homemade pancakes, crepes and other breakfast wonders! My plate was about a foot around and piled as you could see. My meal was daunting and exciting. It smelled of warm cinnamon and buttery toasted caramel. Each bite was delicate, creamy, and cooked to perfection. There were moments where I'd get a bit more of the caramel and the sweetness would ting my teeth, that was quickly stopped by the nutty whipped cream and creamy egg base of the toast. I will definitely be back! Feel free to check out the rest of my review. Heres my post Pamelas Diner and the best french toast I've ever put in my body. Founding Ms.Lydia : Pamela's Diner!!! http://t.co/MFcI1eAIjF"
"4.0","I'm so happy that I came into this woderful place on Yelp. Head there for bruch. We tried the must-order hotcake and the veggie omlet. The hotcakes go together with morning specials with eggs and delicious ham. The hotcake is really crispy on the edge and have a little salty and creamy inside. I really love it. ÔºÅThe omlet is a bit disappointing while the homefried potato side is amazing. Very busy and you may need to wait a while to be served. Noisier than I have expected but very casual atmosphere. You need to check out with cash at the counter, which is quite akward, cause we do not have enough changes for the tips."
"5.0","So far I've been to the Azorean Cafe twice and it did not disappoint. The atmosphere is calm and it's a nice place for brunch/lunch. The staff there was friendly and the food was good."
"5.0","My favorite place for thai in Pittsburgh. Cant say enough good things about them. Excellent food, great value, large portions, and they even throw in random free desserts pretty frequently with dinner orders. The staff is also very welcoming and friendly. I dont live as close to it anymore and have tried many other thai restaurants in the city, but nothing beats Thai Gourmet so I gladly take trips out as much as I can!"
"3.0","Located in the first floor of a house (not that I think anyone lives upstairs, but it is possible) Tamarind is a decent Indian buffet for lunch.  The place is a bit cramped but I've never had to wait for a table for lunch. Decent selection of all your go-to Indian cuisines and the price is decent."
"5.0","The food was delicious and the owners and employees are very nice! The place is very adorable with the little umbrella sky at the patio. Adorable!"
"5.0","DA veggie is just amazing. As well as the potato salad. Mmmm they are always super nice and the place is sooo clean and lovely."
"5.0","This place was awesome!! The private room was really unique, the food was great, the service was A+, and the music was bumpin! Very great experience and would highly recommend."
"4.0","When I asked where this place was located, I was pleased to learn it was located right across from the Courtyard hotel on Penn Ave. Il Tetto is on the third floor, part of a three restaurant complex. There is a small elevator located on the first floor that you use to reach the roof top. Upstairs, you will find a open airy bar. At the time I went (December) the glass roof was closed, but still allowed natural light in.The bar is long with plenty of seats. Also, they have a number of large tables that seat 8 or more. The have a diverse, varied craft beer menu. I went with the Alpine Double Hoppines, which was outstanding. Give this place a chance."
"4.0","The food is good, but I don't recommend going here if you're on a scheduled lunch break. They're very busy right now and still working out some kinks. Today, for example, the ticket didn't print out for my wrap and I waited 30 minutes to find out my food wasn't coming. The manager made my order, and after all that, it was also wrong. The owners are really cool though, and they gave me a card for a free meal. I'll keep going back for now, but I don't know if this is a viable lunch option for downtown Pittsburgh."
"3.0","A nice lunch spot in Oakland that is often forgotten about. All the ingredients are very fresh and local. I had the chicken apple panini, with a side of bruschetta salad, and coleslaw. The total came out to be about $10, which considering how expensive panera is now days is not bad. The panini had chicken, apple compote, arugala, and white cheddar cheese. It was fresh and satisfying. The brushetta was not bad but the red onion was very chunky and overpowering. The coleslaw was also lacking flavor. My friend's chicken meatball looked great, but she said there was a little too much bread. Overall, a nice lunch place if looking for healthy and fresh sandwiches, soups, and salads."
"5.0","What can I say about this place.. I'd have not survived years of lunch in Pittsburgh without Salems.. A must try for those who like Indian, Pakistani, Afghani, Persian or any other middle eastern food.. Everything is displayed behind a glass counter and you can choose 2/3 entrees with rice or naan.. And they wouldn't hold back on quantity in a Togo box..  Plus, they sell goat meat at their butcher section.. A must visit for strip district visitors.."
"5.0","Love it! Great service, great atmosphere and the best food. You can have a cheap meal or go all out for a pricier spread. Great to come here when there's a dj, makes the atmosphere that much better."
"5.0","I literally can't find one thing to complain about this place. Fresh, hot food! The service was quick, smooth and friendly. Clean and cool environment. We had the chicken tiki masala, the lamb chops and the lamb kabobs. Everything was so tender and flavorful. There was also a supermarket attached to the restaurant where you can purchase anything from seasonings to snacks to raw produce. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes Halal food!"
"4.0","Usually a long wait but worth it. I loved the Bus as a player and love checking out all the memorabilia. Very close to Heinz Field. The food is decent but the atmosphere is what sets it apart. GO STEELERS!!!!"
"4.0","I ordered from this place on Grub Hub around 5:40pm on a Saturday. It said it would take 40-50 minutes to come but it came in like 25 minutes! So fast!I ordered the chicken tikka masala and garlic naan. I had a $10 off coupon so it was pretty inexpensive. The chicken was creamy and good but it could've had a little more flavor. Overall it was pretty tasty and served as two meals for me! The garlic naan was delicious. I would recommend this place to anyone!"
"5.0","Sashimi platter 10/10 -so fresh Okonomoyaki 10/10 - crispy and crunchy on the outside. Soft and savory on the insideDrinks were strong and delicious! Can't wait to come back"
"4.0","I had a sample of Cinderlands burger at a charity event and it was one of the best burgers ever! Could not wait to try this place out and we went for Sunday brunch last week.  Our waitress was fantastic and we quickly put in our orders.  I went with the egg breakfast sandwich which comes with cheese and both sausage and bacon on a Martins potatoes roll.  Served with a side of hash browns.  It was a ton of food and oh so much meat! Bring on the meat sweats! My only complaint was no greens in the dish- even a side of fruit would have been good to add a little more color to the dish.  The prices are reasonable and the service was quick.  Always can't wait to go back to try more of their beers which are fantastic and they have such a wide variety."
"3.0","I ordered off this place using uber eats. I usually choose to eat at this place when I order India Food for delivery because its very quick compared to other restaurants. I ordered the lamb Korma, chicken tikka masala and the prince's choice. The lamb korma and chicken tikki masala had pretty good flavor and solid but were a bit on the heavy side. The Prince's Choice was a bit disappointing; it contains pankora, a samosa and tandoori chicken.  The tandoori chicken was very dry and the samosa and pankora were not particularly notable. Overall a good place, but if I had the time I'd go to Tamarind."
"4.0","Food was very good, some of the beer was enjoyable.  I've been here several times and it has been a net positive experience each time.  Food has always been a net positive.  The beer has sometimes been great and sometimes middle of the road.  Example- the latest NEIPA has a flavor profile that just did not fit with what you would expect out of a hazy, and not in a positive way (like wet cardboard).  The Mango Berliner was nice though and I hope they have more winners like that.  Still, for how young they are, they are doing great.  When they dial in the beer game a little more, the place will be very busy very often."
"4.0","Came here for Happy Hour on a Friday with a few friends. It was fairly crowded, as expected on a Friday, but we were able to find a spot at the bar to sit and stand around. Happy Hour specials include $5 drafts, frozen cocktails, and one other drink. The $5 cost for drafts isn't that big of a happy hour deal in my opinion, but getting a frozen cocktail for that price was great. The frozen cocktail was the majority  frozen wine and tasted very fruity. It kept cool in the metal glass they serve it in, so I didn't have to worry about it melting on the hot day. The atmosphere of the bar is relaxing and very pretty. There's a great view of the city, it's tendy, and definitely a place to socialize. I can see myself coming back here in the future."
"2.0","Expensive mediocre food. Ordered 2 veggie omelettes and the bill was about $25. There was nothing special about the omlettes. You can go to any diner in the Strip and get the same food for half the price."
"5.0","Very yummy! Have not eatin at the facility but I got a to go order and it was perfect! Also the owner and general manager where very welcoming and sweet! The bistro has a great family oriented feel. I cannot wait to go and have a sit down meal there!  I got tortellini verde and a Caesar salad. The Caesar salad is a vinaigrette which I enjoyed. They also have a delicious tiramisu!"
"5.0","Way more than a pizza place!  This place is on the 2nd floor of Sienna Mercato.  You have to check it out. Take the steps up right from the main entrance and you will come right into this place. They have awesome bar seating and a great dining room overlooking Penn Ave. Their pizza is unreal, but their gnocchi is all homemade and very unique. They offer small, medium and large plates and all are great for sharing. Pizza is a must try here, but sample a little of everything!  Their desserts are also great. Definitely worth a stop here. There is a parking lot right across the street and you can walk to any of the theaters from this place as well. Good location and great food."
"4.0","The lunch buffet doesn't has as much option as all India. The dinner food is pretty good. Good place for southern Indian food."
"5.0","One of the most authentic and delicious flavors I have ever had. My favorites are mutton biryani, lamb chops. The biryani is very flavorful so you need not much anything with it to eat. Great place."
"1.0","I was kept waiting for almost 50 minutes after the order, very bad customer service. I would surely not recommend this restaurant to any people. Also, I have noticed some signs of discrimination for Indian customers."
"5.0","Leah is a wonderful server, she gave the best recommendations, and we thoroughly enjoyed the evening. 10/10, would recommend, as long as Leah is serving us!"
"5.0","Great atmosphere! Delicious food. Had the portobello sandwich. An assortment of wings and the nachos appetizer. Nachos were a little skimpy on the meat but we still had no problem finishing them off. Nice variety of wing sauces. Service was great! Will be sure to stop in again."
"5.0","Food was fantastic. Service was even better. Great all the way around, especially considering how busy they were after a steelers game. Awesome experience"
"5.0","It's pretty obvious they don't need my 5 star rating because everyone else pretty much agrees. This place is a best kept secret of pittsburgh. I live 60 miles away and I'm positive there is no Chinese food as good in those 60 miles. Sechuzan chicken was spicy but the food was o man sooo good. And then I general tso on another occasion in the last week, just as good!"
"4.0","Tamarind is well rounded restaurant that provides a very enjoyable eating experience. We had the Saag with lamb. This dish is fantastic. I would eat this everyday. We also had the goat curry and the tandoori chicken. They were also good but not like the Saag. The naan was outstanding. The fact that the place is in a house makes the place feel very communal. We talked to the people at both tables next to us the entire night. BYOB is nice as well. We were out the door for around 50 bucks and had 3 meals. The service is really attentive and the people are very nice. We had a great time. Def recommend it."
"5.0","Our experience was incredible. We've tried all the high end places in Pittsburgh but they're doing service right at the capital grille. Our server was Maria who was super engaging, attentive, knowledgeable and most importantly genuine. I really hope other high end restaurants learn this take on service. The entire staff was helpful, especially as I was looking around for the restroom another server asked if she could walk me to it. Our food was great and I didn't expect anything less considering the clientele. We had the calamari which was breaded perfectly. I had the filet my boyfriend had one of the mushroom rub strip steaks. Both cooked perfect and melted in your mouth. Overall loved the entire evening and we cannot wait to come back. Keep it up! P.s. ask for Maria!"
"2.0","I've visited a fair number of Indian restaurants but this one was not quite up to the mark. I went for the lunch buffet on a weekday and the food was too bland for my taste. They had a fairly standard menu: rice, roti, pakoras, two vegetarian and two non vegetarian sabzis. For desert, there was gulab jamun (probably my favorite thing there) and kheer. They had chai as well, but it wasn't hot unfortunately. All in all, there is ample scope for improvement from both a variety and quality perspective."
"1.0","The slowest restaurant I've been to, totally incompetent to handle customers' orders. No ventilation system, smoke comes from kitchen to the dining area and makes it hard to breath, get your thing together"
"5.0","if only every thai place was this good. huge portions for take-out, amazing rolls, wonderful stir-fries and curries. plus we placed a huge take-out order and it came completely accurate, with each dish labeled. a rare treat."
"3.0","Just like I remembered.  Large portions, good wonton soup, average pork dumplings.  Need more broccoli in the General Tso's Chicken.  When they say broccoli is in the dish, 3 small pieces don't constitute vegetables."
"3.0","I can't think of better place to hang out in the summer than on a rooftop bar downtown. Whether before/after a sporting event, while at a convention, or just any random night in the summer, this is a great place to stop in for a beer. And with the retractable roof, it's not too bad in the winter either.My knock on this place has to be the service.  Whether you go up to the bar or have a waitress serving you, it always seems to take forever to get  a drink. Long enough over multiple visits to lose two stars..."
"5.0","The hot is legit hot and the chicken is amazing. The menu is only fried chicken so you know it is good."
"5.0","I love Rialtos! It's my favorite pizza place. I get their xtra large cheese pizza delivered to my work all the time."
"2.0","Terrible service. It took me 30 minutes to receive my to-go order. The person working there kept going to the back while my order was being made and in the end she ended up messing up my order. It made me very angry and wasn't even given an apology. Will not be returning"
"5.0","Authentic taste and reasonably priced. Probably one of the best tacos you can find on the strip! Telling everyone I know about this place!"
"5.0","Kudos to the owners for believing in their product and not masking their origins with some mass product cuisine. Like Portuguese would say - if you like it, you will come again and if you do not like it, you will not come again. The owners give their best with emphasis on traditional cuisine and do their best to explain it.Salted cod casseroles was amazing. It was not just great taste but the texture too. The egg whites give it very fluffy feeling.Octopus casserole had delicious octopus that was chewy but flavorful. You can certainly smell delicious wine in the first class meal.Every item of the appetizer dish could stand on its own, island cheeses were surprisingly gourmet.The whole experience was as if you transferred to these islands, enjoying Portuguese cuisine.I was very happy to support great small Portuguese-American business. You should try it too."
"4.0","Ok, I finally get it. After being in Pittsburgh now for over 2 years and hearing all of the hype about this place, I finally tried it out. Delicious!After reading the menu and seeing the strawberry hotcakes, I decided to order that. I was a little apprehensive because it seemed like it was their version of a crepe, and it had strawberries, brown sugar and sour cream on the inside. Sour cream?...sounded a little weird to me. But I thought, oh what the hell. So it came out with whipped bream on top and after I took my first bite, it all made sense to me. It was delicious! The strawberries were super fresh too. Surprisingly, it wasn't too sweet either. I also got a side of bacon and home fries. It tasted like some good home cooking; the home fries reminded me of some of the best southern cooking I have had. My fiance ordered a waffle, and was far from disappointed as well.The service from our waiter was great as well. He was very gracious and welcoming, regardless that he was obviously very busy. As far as environment, I wouldn't go here if you're looking for a relaxing one. It gets quite loud and you are sitting inches away from the next table.But if you don't mind that and you're looking for some good home-style cooking, especially a good stick-to-your ribs breakfast, this place is perfect for that."
"5.0","OMG so absolutely flavorful and delicious!!! One of my favorite food trucks in the city! I always get the rice bowl with kimchi and dumplings. It's a perfect combination of flavors and textures. I follow them on Facebook because I must order their food a few times a month. Not only is the food good but the gentlemen who own the truck are some of the nicest guys I have ever met. If you've visited them more than once they will greet you by name! Such an amazing detail especially in today's world. This is a must try!!!"
"4.0","The food - bruschetta and fried ravioli apps, side salad, 1/2 order of aglio olio, and rice pudding - was pretty good. The aglio olio and rice pudding were the best parts of the meal. The service was good. Everyone was friendly. The interior could use some sprucing, but, all in all, it was good Italian food. I'll be back for the half-priced wine!"
"2.0","Yesterday was my first time ever stepping foot inside of an Eat'n Park and it's probably not a chain I will be returning too. I was staying at the hotel next door so it was super convenient to just walk order, so that's exactly what I did. The staff was friendly when I walked in and discussed the menu with me before I made up my mind and ordered from the takeout area. I ordered the chicken fillets with French fries and mashed potatoes with gravy (I like potatoes, sue me). The food took about 20 minutes to come out and before you know it I was back at my hotel opening up a container of disappointment. I was not expecting a top notch food experience but I was also not expecting 4 chicken fingers that look like they were served at a baseball game with 12 French fries......why would you call it chicken fillets when they are just a few mediocre chicken tenders? On top of that, the French fries lacked pretty much any flavour making them pretty unenjoyable. The mashed potatoes were alright but since they also didn't give me any plastic silver-wear or anything to eat with I was forced to use one of the chicken strips as a spoon, which was great, really great. They throw in a small Cinnabon, a cookie, and roll for free and the roll was alright. The cookie was terrible and I didn't bother trying the Cinnabon.Overall, I'm going to try and avoid ever returning to a Eat'n Park when I return to Pennsylvania. The food wasn't very good and I'm not going to recommend coming here unless you too stay at the hotel next door."
"4.0","They have greatly improved the tea selection by coming up with inventive house blends. Lavender Lemonade was perfect and not too sweet on a VERY HOT day, the hot ginger blast with lemon was great on a chilly day. Great addition to the community."
"4.0","Today was my second time at a Pamela's. During my first trip I made the mistake of 1)not ordering hot cakes 2) dining alone 3)not ordering hotcakes! I was worried about a wait for a Sunday morning but it was surprisingly only 15minutes. We were seated & greeted promptly. Both of us ordered the morning after breakfast with the strawberry pancakes. The potatoes /home fries were awesome & as another reviewer mentioned it feels as if every bite is different (&fabulous). Speaking of fabulous, I'm thankful to have finally experienced the Pamelas hotcake. It was filled with fresh strawberries, sour cream, brown sugar bits.. & every bite was better than the last. Don't let that trio scare or fool you-.it's delicious Next weekend can't come fast enough to stop back...forgot to mention it took no time at all for 4 giant plates of food to reach our table."
"4.0","Sausalido is amazing! We had reservations here for my girlfriend's birthday on a Friday night, I was excited because I've never heard of it before and it had outstanding reviews. The inside of Sausalido is super tiny & charming. As soon as we walked into the restaurant, I knew I was going to love it!When we arrived, we were seated quickly and greeted almost immediately by our waitress. Our waitress was so nice & took great care of us- which I'm sure was difficult since we were a group of 8 chatty girls with a few bottles of wine in us. Speaking of wine- Sausalido is BYOB! Can't beat that! We were also served fresh bread with a dipping sauce (almost like hummus) to start. We also ordered the smoked gouda and brie cheese as appetizers. Both cheese apps were fabulous!After going over the menu a thousand times, I finally decided on the butternut squash ravioli as my entr√©e. They have a seasonal menu here- so I wanted to try something different that I wouldn't typically order. All entrees are also served with a side salad but I asked to have a side Caesar salad instead. The Caesar salad tasted super fresh and simple- which I love. I also enjoyed the butternut squash ravioli. It was a lot more sweet and a lot less savory than I was expecting. I think this would have been a better dish to split between 2 or 3 people instead and order another meal as well. All of my girlfriends also loved their meals! A few girls got the risotto dish (I wish this is what I got!), another got salmon and the meatballs. This place is definitely a little gem in Bloomfield- I can't wait to come back!"
"5.0","Great place on the corner next to terminal way! Anytime I'm working in the area i try to come down for lunch. The Italian hoagie and philly are my favs! Owners very nice too! Highly recommend it!"
"5.0","Wow! What a cute place. We sat on the back patio underneath the umbrellas it was a beautiful summer day. The service was outstanding, Mariam was very kind. The dirty iced chai I got was so delicious, and I drink a lot of those! The food was amazing and came out promptly. Large portions!"
"5.0","My favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Sushi is fresh (my personal favorite is the ikura nigiri) and anything on the tayaki is delicious. I love the pork belly and bacon-wrapped quail egg from the tayaki menu. My hubby always does the sashimi bowl which he enjoys and is always very fresh. We got to enjoy happy hour this past week with a great drink selection and small bites options. The veggie tempura was fried to perfection, light and crispy, but packed with the perfect amount of flavor. Prices for the happy hour menu were on point. We've walked in on occasion and have had to wait about 20 min or so to sit at the bar in front of grill--I highly recommend getting reservations in advance, especially with a bigger group, since this place gets packed. It will not disappoint. P.S. If you like old fashions, try the Old Osaka. They use Suntori Toki whiskey, and it's amazing!"
"4.0","Thai gourmet was the first place I ate the day I moved to Pittsburgh. Delightful, awesome currys. I have a thai problem, wherein I eat thai at least once a week. This place assists with my addiction. I am a thai addict and I am not ashamed to admit it. Thai gourmet is within walking distance to my house and this place is seriously a frequent stop in my week. I think this place is like a step above thai cuisine, certainly there is something aesthetically more appealing about the interior that is a step above TC. This place is a bit further for me to walk, but I am willing, because the food and ambience are great.I'm a bit panang fan here. I pretty exclusively eat currys at thai places. and TG is awesome. they also carry crab rangoon which I'm a sucker for also."
"1.0","I cant recommend this place to anyone since the food is prepared by amateur cooks who dont mind serving leftovers for the next day nor are they very aware and acquanited with food safety handling regulations. The thing that caused a friend of mine to get food poising and diahrrea after ordering a kefta sandwitch. Not ordering from there again! And we reallly missed the previous owner 'Salems halal' who moved to the strip district."
"3.0","Happy to have discovered a sandwich shop with gluten free buns! I can finally have a regular sandwich... Which I feel is few and far between. I was surprised to see a sandwich I recognized from a sandwich shop in Erie. The DaVinci, which is turkey breast with swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato and pesto aioli.I LOVE this sammie at the shop in Erie, so I of course, had to get it here! I think what really makes it so delicious is that they grill it. I'm not sure if they actually did that here, or if it was a super quick heating up, but it wasn't warm or looked grilled. I also think I had cheddar cheese on mine, unless there's a swiss that is yellow? Plus, I love aioli and it was a little dollop so I had to ask for more. It was good, but I wish it would have been toasted more. It also took a while for us to get our sandwiches. It wasn't busy, so I'm not sure what the hold up was... Especially for the fact that my sandwich didn't seem toasted, which I assume would have made them take longer. I did like the veggie salad side and I loved my pineapple lemonade. Final verdict is that i'll be back, because I'm so thankful they have gluten free buns that don't crumble at the first touch. That's what happens with most buns. I asked where they got them from, but they weren't sure. I'm just going to make sure they toast the sammie next time!"
"5.0","Our server, George was awesome! Best service I have had at any restaurant. Food was good too!"
"4.0","Very tasty hot and cold foods that are always prepared correctly.  It can get a bit busy around lunch time but the staff is always working quickly to get the orders out as fast as possible.  Some of the food is a bit expensive, but they do have a rewards card program that helps you get the occasional free treat.  There is lots of seating here and I've never found it to be too loud.  I like the chipotle chicken sandwich the best."
"2.0","I've gotten delivery from here twice. First time I just ordered a few different, nothing-fancy, pizzas. They were completely acceptable. Nothing spectacular, but no complaints. Second time I ordered a pierogi pizza and a calzone. They were not so good. I wasn't expecting to blown away based on the first pizza experience, but I was expecting acceptable. The pierogi pizza was bland & the calzone was a yucky, sloppy, goopy, bland, mess. Also, delivery guy #2 was a complete ass - no need to call me & force me to run for my phone when I'm standing at my door and I could hear your car coming from a block away. I won't order from them again. I might check out the place to dine-in and see if those breadsticks are all they're cracked up to be. Until then, two stars. Very disappointing."
"5.0","I am here for a conference. Being properly fueled for a conference right after the eat-and-drink-everything holidays, is key. So, looked up healthy food on Yelp. I got both pizza and Freshii. Since I had the pizza last night and have been lacking in the healthy dept (those dern holidays), I chose Freshii. It's a nice walk from the hotels on the other side of Liberty. The menu spans from wraps and fresh juices to smoothies and bowls. There's a kids menu too. I got the Bamboo: brown rice, mushrooms, red cabbage, broccoli, carrots, cilantro and lime. Tofu, chicken or falafel comes with. Tofu, please! They were out of the green curry sauce that accompanies the Bamboo, so I was able to taste test the spicy peanut. It was delicious! I squeezed a couple additional lime wedges over it. Feeling healthier already!The service was very friendly too. Thanks, Pittsburgh."
"5.0","Had the veggie wrap and the roasted zucchini, eggplant and mushrooms were incredible. A must visit if you're walking down the strip"
"5.0","Let me tell you how I even tried this place for a second time. My boyfriend and I were driving down the street discussing what to eat. He asked, 'if you could eat a burger where would you go?' And he listed a places we could go and we discovered that Burghers was the one place you could get a good burger, amazing fries, and a good milkshake. This trip we tried the Bloomfield and were we blown away. This is simply the best burger ever. It's full of flavor and fresh ingredients. I mean we wish there was a Garfield burger in the menu but until then we will say this is the best to us."
"5.0","What a night,  please go there and ask for David. Went to high school with him .we played football with the steelers offensive coordinator. He could have anything in life; he would prefer taking care of you."
"3.0","We have been here several times but it's been a few years since we had been there because so many new restaurants have opened in Pittsburgh. The food was excellent. The Stoli Doli drink they are known for is delicious. But the service was poor. That's why I have to give 3 stars. There were 3 of us. The bill was $350. I never complain about the cost of great meals and I've eaten in the best restaurants around the world. But when food is this expensive, the service must be in alignment with the cost of the food. We were finished eating for 15 minutes before our waitress appeared. Then when she did appear, we asked for the check so we wouldn't have to wait longer to get the bill. I think they need to step up their game since Eddie V's is just a few blocks up the street. The picture is of the steak tartare appetizer."
"4.0","Graciously large portions, amazing bang for your buck (especially for the lunch specials) and when you say 6 on the 'spicy scale' be prepared to take a fire punch to your taste buds. For a dreary day, the cacti and abundance of flora in the window almost make it feel 'tropical' inside. I adored the cultural nic nacs in every corner. It's a regular stop on my trips to the 'Burgh and the area has fun new shops springing up for some after lunch shopping! (Like BoomBox!)"
"5.0","Thai Gourmet is the best thai food in the city, hands down. Authentic, replete with flavors, large portions and well priced. The tofu is particularly good, cut thin, nicely fried wit a great tooth. I recommend the chang mai mee, larb gai, pad kee mow and green curry, but basically everything is great."
"3.0","Solid American Italian food that's not making a pretense of being anything else.  The service was incredibly friendly, the food was well thought out, as promised, and in ample portions.  Half price wine on Monday and Wednesday. Will be headed back."
"4.0","Though it's been while since I've been here, I used to come here with a friend who needed to eat gluten free sometimes.  Although I'm not too big on salads in general, I've really enjoyed the salads I've ordered here.  All of them have been fresh, healthy, and delicious, as well as more creative than those I've ordered from some other local establishments serving salads.  I've also really enjoyed the fruit juices I've ordered here, which are always squeezed fresh.  I appreciate their emphasis on local, in season ingredients, which fits in well with Phipps's theme.  The recycling and composting, as others have mentioned, do too.  The ambiance is bright and clean, given that it's part of the greenhouse itself.  My only complaint is that it can sometimes be difficult to get a table during peak lunch hours, but this problem is nearly ubiquitous in Oakland.  Overall, a great option for people who attend or work at Pitt or CMU who desire a healthy lunch option."
"1.0","Probably the worst service I have ever receieved in my life at a restaurant. I have been here before, and most of the time it was to deal with.  This time, however, was atrocious. It took 10 minutes for someone to notice us looking for a table, even after he walked past us and made eye contact with us. There was no request for a few minutes extra, no acknowledgment, nothing. After waiting for a long time, he walked by and said '5 minutes'. Okay, sure. Comes back, no words, and just points to a table - ok, i guess we'll go there. Wait 10 minutes to order, and actually, we're still waiting. By the time you read this, theres a chance we either leave before we order or we're still waiting. If you plan on coming here, book 2x the amount of time needed...or just go to Choolah, atleast the food is worth it."
"5.0","Great food. The environment is welcoming and pleasant. Food can easily be made vegetarian or vegan to suit your dietary needs. Prices are reasonable."
"3.0","Ordered from these guys several times. Delivery takes awhile so I'm always prepared to wait at least an hour before getting to chow down. The food is really decent compared to other take away places. I'm a fan of the panini sandwiches and salads. Everything is always warm upon arrival. Of course the salads aren't warm, they come chilled nicely with crisp and fresh vegetables. Nice selection of sides too."
"4.0","Good food and generous portions! Tons of variety as well. You can either choose from the ready made food which is pretty good or have them make a fresh shawarma (chicken, beef, falafel) or salad. It's a mix of middle eastern and south Asian food. They also have a store that's connected with a halal butcher shop. One of my go to spots in the Pitts."
"5.0","Nothing to complain about over here! * Food: I've been here around 4 or 5 times and I've never had a bad experience. Most of the time, I order the Tikka Masala but I decided to try something new and order the Kadai with Chicken. We ordered a side of paratha and naan which could probably be shared with 2-3 people. The Kadai was delicious and wasn't too spicy at all! Although I still love my Tikka Masala more, the Kadai was still really good. I think the first time I had Indian food was at this restaurant and they definitely did not disappoint.* Cost vs. Worth: Their entrees are about $13-$15 which is what to be expected in Pittsburgh. I know they have a lunch buffet around that price and is very much worth it.   Will I come here again? - Of course!!"
"5.0","The food was amazing and the delivery was so fast! I absolutely love their good. Its always good, delivery is on time and they are very professional. I would definitely recommend them to anyone and plan on ordering from then again very soon!!"
"4.0","When the craving to have some Indian food hit us...we found ourselves at Tamarind to try some of their offering. Located in Greentree the decor of this restaurant leaves a lot to be desired.Tamarind claims to specialize in North Indian, South Indian & Indo-Chinese cuisines.On being seated we were quickly greeted by our server who was attentive and friendly. We decided to try the kebabs & some Indo-Chinese dishes. The kebabas.. were delicious! I absolutely loved the sheekh kebab! It was flavorful, succulent with the essentials a great kebab should have! We also tried the tandoori chicken which was pretty good. From the Indo-Chinese cuisine, which is basically Chinese food cooked with Indian spices, we tried the chicken 65 & fried rice. These were good but extremely spicy for my palate even though we requested medium spicy food. I wished it was less spicy so I could have tasted more of these dishes instead of washing my bites with water and mango lassi. My friend on the other hand, who has a better spice tolerance devoured his meal. Overall, it was a good experience... especially for the price. Will definitely come back for more!"
"4.0","The buffalo chicken pizza is amazing!! Only reason I wouldn't give 5 stars is because I haven't tried anything else on the menu - I love this pizza that much"
"5.0","This is probably the best bar in Pittsburgh. Fantastic cocktails, shockingly delicious food, a great happy hour, trivia night, and currently the finest Halloween decor I've seen anywhere. Their staff does leave a little something to be desired though. Sure, all the bartenders are funny, cool, and truly talented when it comes to cocktails...but one of them tried to drown me when I was four years old, and I'm still holding a grudge.Full Disclosure: My brother works here. Don't worry though. I would never let it influence my review...at least not positively. That asshole never let me tag along with his friends, and didn't even have the common decency to look enough like me that I could use his ID when I was underage. Family differences aside, The Summit is awesome. The cocktail menu changes somewhat seasonally, but they will always be able to provide quality classics, slight twists on the classics (Old 87!), and completely off-the-wall, you-can't-get-this-anywhere-else-and-I'm-surprised-it-works options. There's a drink right now that is made with house-infused porcini mushroom cognac. And I liked it. The food menu also rotates dishes in and out, but if the brussels sprouts are there, do yourself a favor and get them. They are vegetables, and they are goddamn delicious (the cubes of halloumi help). The burger is outstanding, the fries are perfect, and even the salads are worth ordering. This is far better than average bar food. My only regret is that I spent two days in Pittsburgh inhaling all the meat, and didn't have room for the mac and cheese. Next time."
"4.0","Whether you are visiting Phipps or work in Oakland, this is a spot you need to check out for lunch. I heard the hype around this place and have been meaning to check it out so when I had some out of town guests visiting this was the perfect place to take them. It also helped that it was a 70 degree day in November and we were able to sit outside at their patio tables to eat. The menu has soup, salad, sandwiches and pizza to choose from.  They also serve beer and wine-who would have thought!  I went with the chicken Panini sandwich which comes with cheese, field greens and apples.  You have your choice of a few healthly sides and I went with the bruschetta salad which was a mix of fresh salsa and cabbage (almost like coleslaw).  Everything was super fresh and very tasty.  Others in my party got the pizza which is about the size of a plate and ordered a cup of soup as a starter.  They typically have at least 3 soups to choose from and both the tomatoes and squash were favorites at our table.  Also love that they have a lunch combo which you can get a cup of soup or half a salad with half of most of their sandwiches. The prices all range from $8-$10 and the portion sizes are perfect.  Once you order make sure to grab a table and they will bring out your food once ready. On a busy Friday afternoon our orders came out very quickly!"
"4.0","Absolutely the best wedge salad dressing I have ever had. I loved the salad so much, I barely had room to finish half of the fabulous cheeseburger. We ended up taking the desserts to go (flourless chocolate cake and cheesecake)....to share with the family at home. We waited to make our reservation until the end of the week....sadly, because we would have gone a 2nd time! Our server, Michael was efficient and attentive."
"3.0","Pamela's is all about the atmosphere. The kitchy vibe is a really fun environment to visit for breakfast. I've never had a meal that I've really enjoyed, but then again I can't eat their famous hotcakes because of an allergy. They look so delicious and I'm sure they taste better than they look. I love taking my family here when they visit from out of town. Pamela's is a Pittsburgh classic."
"5.0","Amazing fresh seafood with a twist. Great combinations of seafood and side vegetables. Options are southern, Asians, or American. Something for everyone of you like seafood. Fair prices. Good cocktails. Limited draft beer menu."
"5.0","By far the best Capital Grille experience from all the cities we've been to. Pittsburgh's Capital Grille provides the highest 5 star steakhouse experience. The food speaks for itself, but the service and atmosphere of the space have made the dozens of times we've eaten there consistently amazing. There is no better steakhouse experience in Pittsburgh, and one of the finest in the country."
"4.0","I disagree with Darren. The buffalo chicken pizza was pretty good as was my macaroni salad and the Oreo cheesecake. The only thing was that it took 90 minutes to get to us. Other than that, they're a solid delivery option with a wide range."
"3.0","The restaurant is really cool, it's a old house converted into a restaurant. The area inside is small but sufficient. We didn't know Sunday lunch time was only buffet, we saw the dosa pics and went in for dosa and had the buffet. Luckily plain dosa is included in the buffet. For 10 dollar there isn't much to complain. The food was good but the options weren't traditional, they didn't have a single paneer dish on the buffet that day. Taste wise I would give the food a 6.5/10. Service for the dosa could have been quicker. The naan was too chewy but a decent place to grab a meal."
"5.0","The best Burger joint with great craft brews and not to mention arguably the best fried chicken in the burg"
"5.0","Ordered Kathy's Tailgate catering Special for my son's birthday party and couldn't have been happier. The order placement was quick and convenient and the food was delicious. For ten dollars per person we received five different types of artisanal sandwiches with the best quality meats, breads and cheeses, awesome bow tie/spinach/tomato pasta salad and a mixed greens salad with all sorts of fancy fixings. I would have never been able to replicate this menu for the same cost on my own. I'd recommend Sausalido's catering to anyone."
"5.0","We came here for the last day of restaurant week. It wasn't our first choice; OMG I'm so glad the other place wouldn't take our reservation!  We loved everything about Sausalido!  It's a small, warn little restaurant with maybe 15 - 20 tables. As others have noted, it's BYOB, with a $2/person corkage fee. The menu is quite small, but it's still difficult to decide because everything, literally everything, sounds fabulous. Our waiter was perfect, attentive and friendly without being obtrusive. I ordered the restaurant week Prix fixe meal, which, sadly, wasn't actually on the regular menu. From start to end, it was amazing. After the appetizer, I told my girlfriend that Sausalido was going into our rotation, and by the end of the meal, she agreed that it would be a priority restaurant for us from now on. If you should go when they have it, the paella is the best I've ever eaten, and the side salad with shaved brussels sprouts and feta was really amazing. Portions are large enough to fill me up and for my girlfriend to bring some home. There's parking on Liberty Street, or a municipal parking lot behind the restaurant, I think I'm the same block. Go to Sausalido! It could not have been more fantastic."
"4.0","Enjoyed my experience at the Wild Alaskan Grille. We have eaten eat Wholey's fish market many times, but this was our first time trying out the Grille. The raw oysters were great. It seems you can't find raw oysters in many restaurants anymore, so this was a good find for us. The blue crab salad was the real star here though, the crab was the large jumbo lump crab. It was perfect. The sushi was just OK. I was rather surprised by this. I would maybe order it again, but I've had better sushi elsewhere. Definitely will be back."
"4.0","Late night pizza is a staple of the South Oakland nightlife culture. Offering a $6 dollar pie in just minutes, Antoon's pizza is Pitt's superior late night za. What the business lacks in seating, it more than makes up for in the quality of it's pizza. I won't go to say that Antoon's is the best available pizza in Oakland, but it's the greatest bang for you buck.Antoon's pies feature a doughy crust and a smooth, lightly spiced sauce. The medium thin crust is very well balanced with the proportion of sauce added to the pie. The cheese mixture is done well, and does not puddle with grease like the joint's next door pizza competition.Obviously, some people prefer the ability to sit down in a restaurant to eat their pizza after a night on the town, but if you're a true pizza connoisseur, the quality of pie at Antoon's will win you over each time.Note: The four star rating I gave to this restaurant does not match with my direct review of the actual food, but for the quality of experience for the price you pay!"
"2.0","Here's the deal. The food is good. Rialto rolls are bangin. Here's the problem. They are one of the most expensive places around. Comparatively speaking. Seems like every couple months the portions get smaller, and the prices go up. The sicillian shrunk by half the size, and price stayed the same. When times are tough, this place will break you. Conicellos pizza has replaced them for my tastes."
"5.0","Fantastic addition to Bloomfield! Yummy food, friendly customer service, adorable interior. We will definitely be back!"
"5.0","Doce Tacos are SO good! Not much room for seating, but the tacos are so good, you will gladly take them to go.  I'm a big fan of the chicken and black bean, but my friends swear by the pork. Long story short, you can't go wrong! Tacos are $3 a piece. It makes for an affordable snack, or a cheap dinner. Two tacos curb the appetite, three tacos leave you perfectly full."
"5.0","Visiting from Va and tried this out based on reviews.  So glad we stopped in!  Very casual and small but food comes fast and is yummy!  Would come again if we come back to Pittsburgh!"
"2.0","Second time i ordered Chicago style pizza thought i would give them a fair chance.I lived in Cicago for 35 years i love Chicago pizza THEIRS IS NO CHICAGO PIZZA.I don't know about the rest of the menu but you will be disappointed if you know pizza and expect a real Chicago experience. The dough is not right the ingredients are not seasoned enough. So stay away from ordering Chicago Style unless you have money to waste"
"2.0","So, by 'close at 2:30' they mean if you arrive at 1:58, they will be sweeping up and say the kitchen is already cleaned up and closed. I indicated I was a first time customer but that didn't matter. Boo!"

"1.0","This is single handedly the worst Taco Bell I've ever been to, and that's saying a lot. This location is only a block away from my house and I still make it a point to drive all the way out to Ross Park just for Taco Bell unless I'm desperate. Most, not all, of the workers here are rude and give you judgement for your order, and when you receive it, you're playing roulette with whether or not it's the right item. Also, this location opens and closes their store whenever they want. They have posted hours for both the drive thru and the dining room, but they never obey them. There have been times I've been there 2 hours before they close and the place is already shut down. For example, I went that an hour before they closed a couple days ago, the line was long but I waited. I get the whole way to the menu, and all the lights go out and the lady comes on to say 'uhhh we're closed' like I didn't just sit in a line that was moving and watched the lights just go out an hour before close. Then, they started selling breakfast, which I love, and one day we went to order it at 8 am and they told us they just didn't serve it anymore even though it was on their menu. Who's ordering regular taco bell at 8am? Also, we were told that we couldn't split orders in the car anymore and that they stopped doing that. We've done that for years and it's been a conscience and then all of sudden they say they 'aren't allowed to do that'. It's just a mess. I know it's Taco Bell and 'what do I expect' but this place just needs to be tossed out and start anew. Jeez."

The crust has a salty sweet pretzel like taste that you will crave in your sleep. They are always 100% on point never had an issue with food or service."
"5.0","Ended up going back after another baby class and I got the gyro and garlic naan, as promised. It was very good."
"5.0","My first time coming with my hoppy and daughter. I like the american style of it. Waiters were nice but it was Sunday and its crowded and I waited long time to have my receipt. Food was delicious and perfect and the price is reasonable. Also my daughter got a free heart cookie and she was very happy about it."
"4.0","I was in the mood to try someplace different on my lunch hour, even if it meant trekking a few blocks out of my way.  And after having tried Boulevard Deli, I can safely say it was well worth the hike.  Nearly all of the items on the menu here have Pittsburgh-centric names and it was hard for me to decide.  The Pittsburgher?  Hmm, I'm not exactly fond of chipped ham, so no.The South Side?  Well a good cappicola is always tempting.  The Squirrel Hill?  Hey, that's my neighborhood, so why not!  The Squirrel Hill is corned beef, 1000 Island dressing, and 'kraut.In other words, a Ruben!Oh, but my sandwich was excellent and I was so glad I was able to walk a little bit of it off on the way back!"
"4.0","I ate here with a friend last weekend and have to say it was a good experience. I had the lobster roll and the lobster bisque. Both are delicious and have chunks of delicious lobster. I didn't give it 5 stars because the ambiance is kind of - odd.it doesn't seem like they put a lot of thought into decorating the place or the comfort of the diners. The tables are big spindles that are just awkward to sit at.Great food but please do some remodeling!"
"4.0","Was brought here by a local and overall it was good! Typically dive place - ordered The Cathedral and the Rothlisburger. Other then The Cathedral having too much salt on it, it was delicious! I asked them to fry the egg hard on The Rothlisburger because I don't like runny eggs and they were able to accommodate it. It did take a while for us to get our food - there seemed to be some confusion behind the grill."
"4.0","We had a great breakfast here last week. The blueberry ricotta pancakes that draw so many to this cafe are delicious--sweet, crispy at the edges, fluffy pancakes brimming with large and juicy blueberries. I don't usually get pancakes out because I make great pancakes, but I was pleased my daughter found the reviews of these and convinced me to share them with her. We also shared some eggs with cheddar cheese, served with a toasted ciabatta roll. It's supposed to be a sandwich on a croissant but they were very nice about changing it the way we requested (it wasn't a busy weekend morning). For tea drinkers they carry Harney & Sons teas, which is a nice touch. It's in bags rather than loose leaf, but I know there aren't a LOT of tea drinkers around here, so I am accustomed to it--it was just nice to have a decent tea with my brunch. I'd return for the pancakes--they're definitely better than most you'd get in a restaurant."
"5.0","Have eaten here a handful of times and have had excellent service each time with the exception of once.Week night, small crowd, older waitress who I never saw working there is out front talking with people, sees me walk in, and proceeds to chat until a bigger group of people stroll in. Doesn't acknowledge me, takes their orders first, so I left. Ehh, whatever (maybe I should've spoken up).Came back a few days later for the awesome cinco de mayo special and everything was back to normal. Keep up the good work guys (just try to pay attention when customers come in).Probably the best tacos in the burgh if you're looking for a quick bite. Wish they served alcohol and had seating to accommodate more people but then again, they're surrounded by bars so I can appreciate the dedication to serving up some great grub.Again, keep grinding... I see a lot of potential to expand and prosper.Update: The service and food here continues to be excellent. When asked where to grab a great taco in the city, I always point friends and familiy toward Doce. Five stars."
"5.0","Absolutely delicious and wonderful service to boot! I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with a side salad. The chicken and veggies were perfection. Too much bread for my taste, but an easy fix. Overall really good. Also tried the bottled passionfruit drink, which was awesome. I'll be back!"
"4.0","Tamarind has fantastic Indian food!  We went here on a Saturday night and had no problem getting a table for seven, but it was relatively busy.  We ordered a bunch of dishes, including the samosas, the madras masala dosa, and the navratan korma.  The samosas were really great and came with three little dipping sauces.  The madras masala dosa was tasty - a huge Indian crepe rolled up with yummy potato and onion inside.  The navratan korma was the highlight, with yummy veggies in a creamy tomato sauce with raisins and nuts and other fruits in it.  Yum!The atmosphere is bright and cheery.  The service was a little crusty, but we didn't mind too much.  I hear they have a great lunch buffet, and they also offer deals on different weeknights, like a $25 dinner for two on Sundays, and Dosa Nights on Tuesdays.  Great place for inexpensive Indian food!  We'll be back."
"5.0","THESE WERE THE MOST DELICIOUS NACHOS I HAVE HAD IN MY LIFE. Such a great late night food option. Having a tough time in life? Come here. Your problems will all go away. Nothing else will matter."
"5.0","I've been to umami several times and I keep coming back because the food is just that good. Keep in mind that the restaurant does get busy on the weekends but it's not impossible to get a table here if you reserve a table in advance. The music and ambiance is nice and that definitely adds to the experience."
"4.0","I would give them a 3.5-4 . The decor and vibe of the place was awesome! We liked some of the food we got. I really liked the soba noodles, skewers, and sushi. We got the ramen and it was just okay. The noodles were undercooked.. And the broth was a bit salty. I look forward to coming back and trying out other dishes though."
"1.0","Never did I think you could get this sick from pizza and mozzarella sticks! Haven't had anything else since I have been fasting for a medical appointment. After I stopped in for some mozz sticks and a few slices of cheese and pepperoni pizza. I have been stuck over the toilet on and off for 7 hours at this point. So now I have to see a dr after just leaving the doctor. I called the owner and he was very rude and told me that unless I could prove it was the food I ate he could not help me. Even after I explained my situation he was incessantly rude. Would not recommend to anyone but the Better business bureau"
"5.0","This pizza is amazing. I cannot speak for the authenticity and all of that, but good pizza is good pizza. The deep dish is what you need to get. I can't even eat a small in one sitting and I am a pretty big eater.The inside of the place is a dive. You can eat in but it's got the feel of a take out place mostly, for instance, you have to get your soda at a pop machine inside. But yeah, the pizza is quite phenomenal. If you get the deep dish. DOWN SIZE. It will fill you up fast."
"2.0","Maybe there would be another star if I had actually gotten to eat my dinner at the restaurant. We picked this place because we were staying in the area and their menu had a variety of items.  We ordered one gourmet Mac n cheese, an 8oz sirloin, and a burger.The food showed up about 25 minutes later, after we waved down the puzzled looking person holding what appeared to be our order.The side of broccoli ordered with the mac consisted of two small pieces. With the steak, which was supposed to be served with 'seasonal vegetables' - a squash medley, was served with a crown of broccoli.  Not cut apart or anything, and barely cooked. Unfortunately it was served to someone who can't eat broccoli and was expecting the vegetable that was listed on the menu. The seasonal veggies were a mushy mess of onions, peppers, and a few pieces of zucchini. Not a great start.The person who delivered the food went back to request a different veggie for the steak. We disintegrated let him take the rest of the plate, which ended up being a good thing because it gave us a chance to check the steak.Steak was ordered medium well, sight pink. What came was tough, burnt, and brown all the way through. Finally flagged down a waiter and sent back the steak plate. The only thing on the plate that seemed correct was the sweet potato friesThe manager came and apologized, promising an 8-minute wait. 15 minutes later, after everyone else was done, we still didn't have a steak. Flagged down the waiter (where was he????) and asked for the check. After the check arrived (excluding the missing steak), a to go box arrived with the steak. We left and headed for the hotel.Cut into the steak, and it was barely medium - really red throughout - after a 20-minute walk in a hot box. There were some greasy, limp green beans, and sweet potato fries coated in sugar. Yuck! The first set of fries didn't have any sugar. It feels like their cooks have no idea what's on their menu, nor do they cook anything consistently. Microwaved the steak - gross, I know, but when you're hungry, you do crazy things. Threw out almost all of the veggies/fries and about half the steak (chewy/gristle). Not sure that was better than cereal from the hotel. Sigh..."
"4.0","Great beer selection with late night draft specials during the week.  They don't offer much for food outside of little plates, but the bruschetta was on point.  When it's warm out, the roof opens up and you can see a really pretty view of the skyline.  Parking can sometimes be tricky, but there's a garage and a lot a few blocks down.  I'll definitely be back when the weather warms up."
"5.0","For Japanese restaurants. Kiku is definitely a nice stop for when you're in Pittsburgh. The prices can get a little high, but, for the amount and quality of food you'd be getting, it's reasonable. The wait staff was extremely friendly and attentive and the lighting and atmosphere of the restaurant is perfect for conversation. It was wonderful experience, and I'd recommend it to anyone who's looking for a nice evening in the city.  Being located in Station Square is also a very nice addition."
"5.0","This was probably the best burger I have ever had. The fries are just as good. Vanilla milkshake was the real deal. Mexican War was spicy and flavorful, the Shadyside was mushroom heaven and the Pittsburgher was traditional amazing."
"5.0","Thai Gourmet is not a 'foodie destination'.  It is not fancy, it offers nothing that you can't get at any other thai food restaurant.  BUT...WHO CARES?!?!  This is one of my favorite spots in East Pittsburgh.  Simple but great tasting thai food.  Cheap.  Great service (Let's not forget the underrated service of constantly filling up your water glass, some restaurants would be well served to be more attentive to their patrons beverage consumption habits). BYOB.  Great for groups, great for couples.  Always seemingly busy, but you can always get a seat.  It is my favorite place in Bloomfield (sorry Station).  You'll always have leftovers, which somehow taste better the next day.  The one measly complaint...the spice levels are pretty arbitrary.  A 3 is sometimes nothing, other times it will drop capsaicin all over your tastebuds to the point of submission.  Lesson learned, either go spicy all the way or not at all, you half-committed dope!  But it's almost endearing ('Gee, i wonder how spicy a 5 will be this evening').  Overall, this is a great place when you're not looking for quintessential asian food on a whim.  It's perfect.IF THIS RESTAURANT WERE A MUSICIAN/BAND: Garth Brooks.  Look...I know he's not high art, but when you're in the mood for fun without pretention, there is no substitute.  Garth can really hit the spot sometimes."
"5.0","Came here late after our flight was delayed 3 hours, recommended by our hotel receptionist. Great vibe for late on a Thursday night. The prices, food, and beer were good, and the service was outstanding."
"4.0","Kiku ... maybe it's my fault that I used to love you, and now we're just friends. It could be that I ordered a measley eel/cucumber roll, and maybe you didn't find that fancy enough. Or a Philadelphia (that you so endearingly renamed Shadyside). In my Dynamite, you forgot my spicy mayo (maybe that's for the better, but you did kindly garnish the plate with a bit). All three of my rolls, it seems you forgot some of the fish. It hurts my heart; your fish is so fresh ... when you put it in the roll, I enjoy it even more. I should've stuck to the Sushi Regular or the Chirashi, because those have been perfect in visits past. Your ginger dressing is still to-die-for, even though at $4 I feel a little portion robbed on the salad. And I'm wondering about the newest edamame fad - salt your own. Is this fad in fact, or faux paux? Kiku is still my second-favorite sushi restaurant in Pittsburgh. But with the recent menu renovations, I'm wondering if they're trying to be a little 'more' than they should - it's quality sushi, in a good environment ... but the prices need to return to being justified."
"3.0","I had really high hopes for this place from the first time I walked by.  Unfortunately it was a let down on multiple fronts.First, the atmosphere is not at all welcoming.  It feels like a cafeteria inside.  There is very little decor, the floors and walls are just a bright white, there is a lot of open space, and it just has a weird vibe.  It does not set the scene well for a good eating experience.  The bar area did look cool so maybe I would try to sit there if I ever come back.Onto the food.  Upon looking at the menu I immediately had a bad feeling because the menu says they 'smash' their burgers.  I am not sure why this would be something you advertise.  I'm hoping by they mean prior to cooking they smash down the uncooked meat, rather than during cooking. I ordered the Maggie's Farm burger.  I was expecting a high quality burger given fact that burgers are their main focus, as well as the high prices.  What I got was nothing of the sort.  The burger patty is way too small.  If you are going to be selling five guys style burger patties that is fine, and I can enjoy a good thinner burger.  But to charge $13 or more for a thin smashed burger is absurd.  I ordered mine medium rare and it was over cooked.  I'm not sure if this is even the fault of the cook however because I don't know if it's possible to cook such a skinny patty to medium rare.  The burger also did not come out very hot.The fries were good, as was the homemade ranch dressing.  The overall flavor of the burger was actually good, just not what I was expecting.  It reminded me of Red Robin.  An average piece of beef, but with some very good sauces and toppings.  I just wish they would price their food as such."

"5.0","Ooohhh my gosh!!! We just passed by this place randomly, and we're shocked by how awesome this tea is!! They have a bunch of different options of loose leaf tea available, and they of course offer hot and iced teas. We got the blood orange tea lemonade as well as a peach apple coddler iced tea. THEY WERE SO GOOD!! I definitely recommend the peach and apple coddler, I'm probably coming back just to get this one again. The decor inside is very nice, and they even had a little game of tic tac toe you can play. It's really cute!Definitely recommend this place!"
"5.0","La Gourmandine is an absolute treasure, and I'm so glad they have a downtown location now. Their almond croissant is the best I've ever had, and their coffee and espresso drinks are great as well. Everything is extremely decently priced, there's free wifi and nice seating, and the people working here are super nice and friendly. Couldn't ask for more!"
"5.0","Wow is all I can say!  Really awesome place.   The food is amazing and the service is excellent also!!!!!"
"3.0","I really used to like Thai gourmet, however after my latest takeout, I feel as if the quality has diminished. I ordered spicy basil with chicken and it was just chunks of chicken with some onions and a few peppers thrown in. I expected many more vegetables as was the case when I had previously ordered a few months ago. Also, the taste was odd and did smell like the spicy basil that I was used to from here, but rather a strong smell of cooked chicken. I will definitely give Thai gourmet another chance, as they may have been having an off day, but I was rather dissatisfied."
"3.0","Seems ok, until you order, the food is average at best, nothing special, kinda like a bad Dennys, service is ok, then again not memorable, prices are fair for the food, wouldn't recommend, reckon if your drunk this food is better. Guess the chef who creates these dishes eats dog food, thinks it's great."
"3.0","First time coming here and definitely our last. Ordered with Collin who had absolutely no customer service. We decided we didn't want a blueberry pancake after she told us our total and to her it seemed like the world was ending. She literally said ' for God's sake you've got to be kidding me.' This was before we had even paid! She's all frazzled and her co-worker said it wasn't a problem at all. Just horrible customer service and we won't be coming back. Everyone else seemed nice and hospitable . Food was okay nothing special but not worth the horrible service."
"3.0","Came here on opening night. The place was busy but small. It is very narrow. The atmosphere was nice though and it was set up nicely for the space they have. Didn't like sitting right where they prep the food. Seems like it may cause an issue of contamination if someone sneezes? We didn't eat here. The beers weren't that great, we like ipa beers mostly and there was a very small selection. The said ipa beer really didn't taste or resemble an ipa, even the waitress agreed with us when we mentioned that. Probably won't come back, but cool to check out atleast once!"
"1.0","This place sucks. Went in late on a MONDAY for a couple beers. I like the ipa's. The beers were 10.00 each! AYFKM! My buddy got Liney and they were 7.00. Never again Redbeard!  You got me this time...but you won't anymore!"
"5.0","We were hungry for hamburgers before we tucked in on a snowy night for March Madness & found Burgh'ers!  Fabulous!  A great atmosphere, cute bar, friendly & helpful employees.  We tried the Pitt's Burger & the Polish Hill Burger.  Both were delicious.  The mini is just the right size if you don't want a full burger.  The fries were yummy.  They bring Red Ribbon water bottles upon being seated.  What a nice beginning.  We had a craft beer which was great & I always love Red Ribbon Vanilla Cream Sodas when I can get one.  We will definitely return!"
"4.0","If you don't love this sandwich you are straight savage,  every bite is like a mini explosion of delicious beef waiting to fill all your taste buds with happiness!"
"4.0","Great dining experience, but order the sushi NOT the ramen. The first time I checked this place out this summer we received really great customer service. We were seated at the bar on a Wednesday night because the wait for tables were an hour long (Be sure to make a reservation in advance!! This place is so popular) The vibe of this place is fantastic. I'd love to come at night sometime for drinks. We ordered a few appetizers and two bowls of the tonkatsu ramen. The ramen took over an hour to come out so we flagged down our waitress and she apologized profusely and brought us drinks and another appetizer on the house. The ramen however, once it arrived, was so so salty. I cannot emphasize how salty I found the ramen to the point I couldn't bring myself to drink the broth at the end. They are generous with the pork but be aware that it's not tonkatsu! (although still good) Just a big fat pork rib. I returned a second time for my birthday last month and ordered the chirashi bowl. The sushi tasted really fresh (loved the scallops) but honestly I was still so hungry afterwards because the bowl was so small (lol). I attempted to finish my friends ramen and then could not be I remembered how salty it was. Loved the vibe + drinks but for the price and the hype, the food honestly not so much."

"4.0","This was my very first time ordering from Prince of India.  I was a little nervous to submit my order because the reviews had been so mixed on Grub Hub.  Many had given 1-star calling the food tasteless and greasy.  However, I felt differently about the food...and boy was that a relief! I ordered the Fish Masala and Samosa Chaat.I'd never had fish masala before: the fish was salmon, fresh salmon at that...and it was great!  I loved the sauce.  The salmon was cooked well and the portion was great.  Basmati rice was included.  The portion was so large that I couldn't really get to the samosa chaat.  However, I still managed to taste it.The samosa chaat was not as high in my ratings.  I'm used to a cold chaat, or at least that's what I prefer.  The few times I've had it warm the yogurt was visible.  I'm not sure if the yogurt was mixed in or just absolutely missing.  I also don't see any crisps...unless they are mixed in and soggy.I think that I may reorder the fish Marsala!  Time will tell about the samosa chaat..."
"4.0","As an out of towner I had to ask around for reccomendations and this place was high on people's lists. The building is like an old house which I found quaint. A nice quiet restaurant near the universities and a short walk from the dirty bars of Shadyside if that's your next stop. I had the Tika Masala and Mango Lassi and it didn't top the list of best I have ever had, but it was passable. The garlic nan was a nice addition. If I end up spending more time in Pittsburgh I would go back to this place. Definetly a step above most of the food available in the area."
"5.0","I can't say enough good things about Prince of India. The service is fast and the staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating. The food is delicious and flavorful. My husband and I have made it a regular date spot and go as often as we can. The prices are very reasonable as well. We both love the Malai Kofta and Vegetable Jalfrezi! There are a lot of great vegetarian options and the naan is some of the best we have had!"
"4.0","On my way to a meeting, I stopped in grab a quick bite. I stopped in at just the right time as a few people were leaving the counter.As it was my first time at the taqueria, I asked what the recommended. The others at the bar suggested I try both a corn and flour tortilla so that I get the best of both worlds. I chose the vegetarian (black bean) and chicken tacos.The tacos were ready in a flash and came topped with cheese and a lime on the side. The tacos were both delicious and I think that the black bean was my favorite. Both weren't as flavorful as I would have imagined, I was expecting more of a punch, but you could tell that the quality was there.This place is pretty small and only seats up to maybe 8 or so at time, so if you're looking for a late night snack, definitely grab and go!"
"5.0","My husband chose this place for a date on a Friday night. Based on reviews and researching the menu, we were excited about the place, however not thrilled about the drive to get there. For a Friday, it didn't turn out too bad and we were able to find an on-street parking spot not far from the restaurant. The main street of the town is cute and full of restaurant options if we choose to head this way in the future. Walking into the restaurant, it was smaller than I expected, however had very romantic, earthly feel to it.  We were greeted pleasantly by a waitress and she informed us that we could choose where we wanted to sit. As the place was pretty much full, we were limited on options but were able to find a table for two. Closely spaced with minimal walking space between each one, you could hear the conversation of the guests next to you. The table was set with candles and a rose in the center. As it was BYOB, our waitress was quick to open our bottle of wine and pour a class for each of us, placing the rest of the bottle in an ice bucket for when we wanted to refill later. This menu was so exciting to me! I am not very adventurous when it comes to food, however, there were several options with a slight twist that sounded worth trying. We were started off with complimentary white bean hummus with dipping bread drizzled with balsamic vinegar. It was pretty tasty and a great way to begin dinner. After questioning the waitress on what to order, I ended up with the Pan Seared Duck Breast served over cubed roasted potatoes, and a side of fresh pears and apples. To my surprise the pear and apple combination was served cold but paired well with the rest of the dish. The waitress was kind enough to give us a side of Fettuccine Carbonara (the other dish I was torn between)  to share and man was it delicious! Large, freshly cut ham and bacon covered in a wonderful cream sauce. I was in heaven! My husband ordered the Salmon and Quinoa and thought it was good. The portions were large enough for me to take a small amount home for lunch the next day. This place: wonderful ambiance, delicious food, exceptional service. I have a feeling we will be back in the future!"
"5.0","I love this place a piece of Brooklyn in Pittsburgh. This was my second visit while visiting family.  Delish biscotti and pizelles made right there. The smell is delightful. The owner has wonderful prepared and packaged food she made. Beautiful gift shop.  The owner is as lovely as her shop"
"5.0","Friendly staff. Great breakfast sandwiches. Good produce. This is a great little place to walk to on a Saturday morning to grab some groceries and a sandwich/ coffee to start your day. The sandwiches are made in house and they'll put it on the press for you to heat it up."
"5.0","This place is so cool! Came in from Nashville for a wedding and was told the Hall of Famer would change my life...it did! Bones, our server, aka Chris Feathers, was an awesome guy! He gave us crack in a cup and was just an all around good guy. You knew he loved his job. Thank you Chris!"
"5.0","Make sure you have cash because you CAN'T MISS THIS AMAZING TACO STAND! We would go back every day if we could. It's our favorite place on the strip to eat.  I always get the 2 chicken tacos with everything on it and add your own salsa in the salsa bar to the side of the stand. There are two picnic style tables to sit at. They also have cheap specials that you can try including empanadas, etc. They're very friendly and sweet. The quality is always consistent. You can smell the deliciousness from blocks away."
"5.0","Our server Gabriel P. Was phenomenal. Service was on point although it was a busy time. He kept our drinks full and kept calm throughout the busy moments. Coached us through ordering times due to the business on when to place orders and fully accommodated 10 people during the rush of Pittsburgh in North shore. Highly recommend to everyone"
"3.0","Not too impressed with the corned beef sandwich.. I figure if you have the words 'Famous Corned Beef' in you name it better be damn good... This one wasn't at all."
"1.0","DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE! they 100% of the time mess up the order, regardless if it's 1 item you're ordering or 5. I guarantee you they will not get one item correct. They won't refund your money when they make a mistake nor will the fix the mistake by cooking the item again. The pizza/calzone/breadsticks are NEVER cooked thoroughly."

"4.0","Beer. Is. So. Good. I loved the farmhouse brew.Service was excellent. Our waiter was really knowledgeable about the menu. Tried the Brussels sprouts, kielbasa, and soft shell crab. All of it was really good but not enough to give this place five stars.I will definitely be back. This is a great addition to the hood!"
"4.0","Great selection of food here and the service is pretty on top of it. With the numerous visits, I've had the club sandwich, pierogies, chicken pasta, mac and cheese and a salad here. All good. The restaurant has a lot of TV's scattered in the restaurant to watch the game while eating. Overall a fun atmosphere. We did run into an incident on last nights visit where the receptionist had penalized us by having us sit out in the wind and cold weather because my guest, I was with had a service dog with her. We spoke to our server at the end of the meal to find out if that was the normal procedure and she assured us that it was not. She spoke to the manager about it, which he apologized and spoke to the ma√Ætre d.I would recommend the restaurant and especially the pierogies with the sour cream dip."
"5.0","Cinderlands gets my vote for best new spot for beer & food in the city.  Quite the adulation I understand, but let me continue.The staff is warm and welcoming, I've never had bad service in a city that often times allows for aloof and sometimes lazy service.The beer, I could go on for hours about how good their beer is.  They nail every style I have had and have cashed in on the New England IPA hype with some killer soft juicy IPAs.  Although, my favorites have been their traditional often passed over styles.  Right now as I type I am craving both their Zwickel Lager and their Grisette, what other breweries in the city can you have those styles AND a NEIPA?Now, and probably most relevant to this space - the food.  Cinderlands again just doesn't disappoint.  They run 2 menus with very little overlap, the first is their dinner menu which doesn't overwhelm is tweaked for the seasons and is on point.  The second is the brunch menu which has been crushed by yours truly.  Bold statement incoming - Their burgers are top 3 if not best in the city.I could keep going, but go try for yourself - oh quick tip if you don't like beer they mix up some great cocktails using local spirits as well.Cheers!"
"5.0","Each time I'm hanging out in the Strip District with one of my brothers and I ask about going to eat somewhere, immediately they suggest burgers. Peppi's has been the go-to for several reasons and we never leave disappointed.As you walk in, there is a long counter that the chefs are behind. Then, walk down to the register and place your order. The chefs and workers have all been exceptionally kind, especially D. Each time I have visited Peppi's, D has made my visit and my guests visits both happy and memorable. On top of the great service, the food is also delicious. My obsession with Italian hoagies can be temporarily satisfied with joy here. They serve the burgers on footlong sub rolls and my brothers think it's the coolest thing. If you are a vegetarian, they have options for you, too! Their cheese fries are amazing. Also, prices are pretty fair here. You can get away with a good meal for around $10, which is to be expected if you're getting a large sandwich and a pile of fries bigger than the Great Pyramid of Giza.When you're done eating, you'll be heckled a little for not finishing your food, but a worker will wrap it up for you with a smile. Without a doubt we'll be visiting Peppi's again soon!"

"5.0","Amazing food at a more reasonable price then most other Thai places here. They do not sacrifice quality! Their lunch specials are great"
"1.0","Had lunch here today with my husband and son. We love Indian food. We were happy to see hey offered a lunch buffet until we approached it. Very few choices. The dishes that had chicken in them barely had any chicken in them. The sauces were all unusually runny. Plain naan only. They won't make garlic naan. I live chai tea! I tried theirs. This is not chai tea. It was the right color. However the smell was off. After taking my first sip I discovered it was bitter with a strong lemony hint."
"2.0","Pretty ordinary bland-ish food, for too much money. The chicken Philly was disappointing and the wraps weren't any better.The trouble is the rest of the independent restaurants in USX aren't a lot cheaper. My suggestion is that your money is better spent somewhere else if you are willing to walk out off the USX building in bad weather."
"4.0","I went here on Black Friday for the first time, when nothing else was open! OMG - so good! I got a roasted chicken sandwich and guess what - real chicken breast! And the fries...I'm not even a fry person, especially natural fries, but they are bomb.com!! And reasonably priced for the bldg...9 bucks for the great sandwich, enough fries for 3, and a cold rootbeer...can't beat that!! The most important thing I think is the people. They are so genuine! My 2nd visit and multiple people are calling me by name...c'mon now, where they do that at? LOL"
"4.0","Very cute cafe convenient to Children's Hospital. Their brunch is excellent, so make sure you look at their $20 3 course deal. I've always loved their fruit plate, which is large enough to share. The crepes are very good, both savory and sweet. Plenty of vegetarian options. Over the many years I've been here, the service may slip a little, especially if busy, but on the whole, this is a fun place to go with group. They serve bottled water, which I'm not a fan of, due to ecological concerns, so I wish they would rethink that policy. There's outdoor seating in the back."
"5.0","I've got to admit that I wasn't expecting much when I dropped in Bettis Grille with the boy for a late lunch. We were out on our boat and he was hungry...so we docked close by and walked up the steps. I have to say...they really exceeded my expectations...and my boy was happy too! I enjoyed a terrific blue cheese burger with a sriracha based dressing that was terrific! William had a salmon entree, and he was all smiles about it! Topped off with great service and a bill that didnt hurt at all...hey, this place was great!"
"5.0","Love the atmosphere and the creative drinks they make - whiskey selection is good, and their beer selection is moderate but good choices to pick from (not a bunch of domestic boring beers haha). You can play board games and card games here, and it's open when it's nice out so it's nice and breezy. Great place."
"4.0","This has to be one of the best restaurant around for chinese food or maybe I'm just a little biased.  During weekends, the next room holds a live karaoke and that's where I fell in love with this place.  The food is just as good!  I normally order the scallion pancakes, the hot won ton soup and chinese spinach and it's always tasted so good.. my mouth is watering just thinking about it.. highly recomended place for sure!"
"5.0","My coworker brought me here for lunch this week. It's nestled right on Smithfield Street, but it wasn't super busy during the lunch hour. The menu is typically deli foods: sandwiches, salads, a little case of prepared salads (pasta, tuna, chicken salad, etc). But one really cool thing was that they have a salad bar, so you can make your own salad. In the prepared food section, they also have little containers of grilled chicken that you can purchase to top your salad with some protein. I decided on that option. My coworker went with a half sandwich and soup. All of the vegetables and chicken were very fresh. The service was really good too- they offered to heat up my chicken, which I appreciated. The prices are pretty on-par for downtown. I'm very surprised this place wasn't busier than it was, but I'm glad it wasn't. I will definitely be coming back here for a nice quick, reasonable lunch option!"
"5.0","Great chai tea! And everything else is great too.. Wish it was closer to where I live, but it is still worth it to go to Oakland."
"3.0","I was brought here by a friend and was pleasantly surprised by the set up. An old living and dining room set up like a restaurant was sort of cool. We came at the tail end of the weekend lunch buffet, but the options didn't taste like they'd been sitting around for 3 hours. As a former Indian Garden addict, I really liked the focus on more vegetarian friendly dishes on the buffet instead of the normal chicken tikka masala and such. I can't remember for the life of me what the names of anything I had was, but I can tell you that it was yummy and worth it. Get there early or later if you don't want to sit in a loud and cramped room. Will be back during dinner hours so I can order from the menu!"
"5.0","As I've said a few times in other reviews, my Partner In Cuisine and I really try to avoid corporate restaurants, but the Capital Grille is a rare exception and it earns itself five stars.  Perhaps I am a bit biased because my one and only experience here was on my birthday, but given the exceptional level of service and food, I can't bring myself to give anything less.The PIC went to great lengths to make my birthday dinner a special surprise after I had mentioned hankering for a good steak.  We arrived at the restaurant and were greeted immediately by not one, not two, but three people.  We were seated at a cozy little out of the way booth which had been set up with a tasteful sprinkling of birthday confetti.  I got my favorite drink from the bar (amaretto sour) which had been generously portioned with amaratto and before too long, we were getting a variety of breads to munch on.  The PIC had ordered our food before arriving so it wasn't even 10 minutes before I was looking at a delicious NY Strip (my favorite) and his filet as well as the most exquisite macaroni and cheese.  We ate everything!  After dinner, I received a complimentary cup of coffee and creme brulee which I shared with the PIC.  We left feeling fat and happy.I feel that the wait staff really went to great lengths to make me feel special on my birthday.  Of course I'd go back again, but I think this is a place best kept for special occassions because it is NOT cheap (I stole a peek at the bill!)."
"4.0","Tasty and fast food, this was the first hot chicken place I've been to and I'll definitely be back!Food-wise, the scale of spiciness guarantees that you're able to come here with friends of many different spice tolerances! The chicken itself is tender and moist, with no issues on the cook. My only concern would be the amount of salt in the seasoning-- okay in a sandwich where you have other flavors to balance it out, but harsh for individual tenders. The coleslaw was crisp, the bread fluffy but not soggy, and it was a delicious meal overall!Waffles and fries looked to be standard fare. Note that they don't accept cash, and get very busy on Friday nights! Seating is pretty limited during those times, but service is very fast."
"1.0","Tried calling to place a take-out order, recording said they were busy to call back. Walk to the restaurant to order and they were closed, no signs on the door or anything indicating why. Who knows when they're even open? If they are."
"4.0","I'd give a 4.5 if I can. This place is not at the best location but they do some serious Japanese food! For apps, we ordered the Karaage and the grilled King mackerel. There are four pieces perfectly fried chicken thigh in one order of Karaage. As a decent Japanese restaurant  should present, the flavorful juice exploded with each bite of the Karaage! The grilled mackerel is good, too, yet a little salty to my like.For entree we had the sukiyaki. And it was amazing!! The soup is so much more than normal sukiyaki sauce or ponzu sauce. As the soup starts boiling and the vegetables start melting, the unique taste of shiitake mushrooms, the sweetness of carrots and the spiciness of onions and green onions mix together to generate a rich flavor. In this delicious soup base you cook the thin beef slices and dip them in the egg sauce for a very tender texture. They just melt in your mouth! I'll definitely come again for the sukiyaki!For drinks, I had a Kiku punch which is quite light and sweet. My friend had the green tea, which is also pretty good."
"4.0","Exactly the kind of place you want to eat in the Strip. These guys get it right!I've been here countless times and they are always busy. Always. There's a reason for it, the impeccable food and service. Even though it's always busy the wait for food is nowhere near as long as you'd think.They've cornered the market on knowing how to do a great sandwich whether it's a burger, wrap, melt or hoagie style sandwich, they're the masters."
"4.0","I've loved this place for as long as I can remember. Sad it's all the remains of Pittsburgh's Chinatown.For the longest time I haven't been able to get back here and now that I'm wishing walking distance on a daily basis I'll get to make up for that.It's got such a serene atmosphere and it's really a nice way to enjoy a relaxing meal, especially when ducking in from the hustle and bustle of weekday downtown life.Dinner is a nice time as well, relaxed and peaceful. Even if it's super busy at lunch or dinner it's still peaceful.The food of course is the best part. While we have several places in the city and surrounding areas for Chinese cuisine, Chinatown Inn ranks at the top of the list."
"3.0","I got Spinach and Paneer, Chicken Tika Masala, and Kufta Kebab Meal.  I've eaten all of these things many times in other places and all are favorites. What I got was soo spicy that I had to mix them with condiments to be able to eat them! Even the rice was spicy. I'm not a sissy with spicing, but this food was hard to eat and I probably will not go back."
"2.0","Note* I went here about a year ago so maybe things have changed a bit since then. However, this place was a big let down. The cost of the food here is equivalent to what you'd pay at some of the higher end restaurants in town (ex. Eleven), yet the quality and service is no where near those places. We came here on a Friday night and the place was pretty much filled. I could tell right away the service was going to be a bit questionable. The staff seemed really stressed and frustrated. They were all running around in a semi-panic barely able to keep up. I looked at the wine menu and asked a few questions and my server admitted to not knowing anything about wine. That's okay, but based on the prices of the wine and food, the staff should be well trained in this area.Then the food was just 'meh'. I ordered a steak and it wasn't trimmed or cooked correctly. It was also really under seasoned. My fiance ordered some pasta and she compared it to something we'd make at home on a lazy night by just using some canned sauce and boxed pasta. Overall, a pretty big let down - especially since this place is so close to us. If the cost of food here was about 50% less than what it currently is, I'd have given this place a much higher rating. As a restaurant though, if you're going to price your items in the top-tier you need to make sure your offerings are competitive with similar places. And this place fell substantially short."
"4.0","My group arrived to Pittsburgh and the first place we wanted to try was Emporio.  I love meatballs and it's something that I really don't eat enough of.  BUT, the wait was super long and I wasn't sure whether it was the furry conventioneers or just a regular busy Thursday night.  After taking a peek upstairs at Mezzo and seeing that they didn't have a wait, we trekked up the floor to settle our hungry stomachs.As tempting as the charcuterie and cheese board was, two people in my group ordered the chef's selections, I went in the opposite direction and got the mushroom risotto.  After eating literally eat every morsel of rice on that dish, I have to say that I was entirely satisfied.  It was the right portion and not too buttery rich.  And I did get to try some of the charcuterie from the table and it was exactly as advertised.  Rich, fresh, and left me wanting more.  Mezzo actually had their own draft beer selection separate from the Il Tetto 36 draft selection but after asking our server if she can grab me their menu, she said that she can get me any of the beers from their list and bring it to our table.  The dining room is a bit on the dark side and there wasn't a lot of ambient lighting.  Conversations also may be slightly difficult to have in the room but otherwise it was a fun, interactive, and different experience than what we could have had at Emporio.  I just need to make sure to come back here if I'm ever back in Pittsburgh."
"4.0","Really great sushi. Definitely better than other places I've been to. They have all the common favorites along with a whole assortment of really uncommon rolls that are fun to try."
"5.0","It's a must try for anyone in the area. The food is great, and Try their beer slushies for a refreshing beverage. It's a very intimate yet casual atmosphere."
"5.0","Our server Sharon was so amazing!  She made great suggestions and had the best personality!  She made us feel very comfortable and made my son feel like a rock star!"
"1.0","All I can say is it was FAKE!Especially the Udon. It was so sad to see a supposedly autentic Japanese restaurant that served this bad Udon. Yokoso teppanyaki place who are not run by Japanese served better udon than what they served here. It may not be a big deal, after all, it's just noodle...but I just hope that people won't think that is udon.Sushi was ok.  Many of the dishes served here are supposed to be a down-home dishes such as Kushikatsu. They were way overpriced.Atmosphere was ok."
"5.0","I work for a Darden Restaurant, and it's no secret that The Capital Grille is Darden's most exquisite dining experience, so I had to try it. I reserved a table for 2 for Valentine's Day months in advance and was looking forward to this night for months. My boyfriend and I were greeted by some really cool valet guys that parked our car for us. We went inside and waited for a few minutes and were sat at a lovely large table in the corner in a separate room. The table was decorated for Valentine's Day with glitter. Our server was incredibly friendly and attentive and answered our questions with a smile (as a server, I KNOW we were being annoying with all of our questions) but she was happy to help us. Myboyfriend and I both started with the spicy pan-fried calamari with cherry peppers. It was so good! If you like seafood and spicy food, you have to try it. This coupled with the variety of artesian bread was a great way to start our night together. Then we both settled on the surf & turf with lobster mac & cheese as our side. My surf & turf was delicious - filet mignon with South African lobster tail. Delicious, sweet, buttery, and both the steak and lobster melted in my mouth. The lobster mac & cheese was easily the best mac & cheese i've ever had. For dessert, my boyfriend had the signature cheesecake and I had the flourless chocolate espresso cake. Both of these desserts were probably two of the best desserts I've ever had in my life. Our night together was romantic and memorable and the food was INCREDIBLE! It was our first Valentine's Day together and it was certainly very memorable thanks to The Capital Grille. I'm certainly one for trying new places, but I think I may have found a new tradition for Valentine's Day. As a Darden employee, I have eaten at almost every other Darden concept, and I can easily say this is my favorite (sorry Olive Garden ). Five stars doesn't express how fervently I would recommend this place."
"5.0","Not sure why it took me so long to get to Burgher's, especially after all the buzz around this place. Their flagship location is in Harmony with the second, newer spot in Lawrenceville. The spot in Lawrenceville is awesome. So very clean and crisp with cute d√©cor. Nice bar area with a few TVs (LOVE the bar stools and how you can adjust their height). Open 7 days a week. They have their own Brew House so house beer on draft, plus others, and then a very extensive bottle list. Menu is quite big with tons of starters, burghers, sandwiches, etc. The Impossible Burger from here is INCREDIBLE. Their sourdough bread is vegan and I can't get enough of the burgher, which you can either customize to your liking with tons of fix-ins, or choose one of the styles they've created on the menu. Burghers come with fries or side salad, and you can upgrade to their rosemary fries which are out of this world amazing! Don't skip out on those, they're unreal! The staff is also SO kind here. Owner's come over to ask how we're liking our food, the girl that works the bar is super friendly, and the hostess are seriously always so perky. Burgher's just won some crazy prestigious James Beard Award for best blended burgher 'The Fox Chapel' against over 350 restaurants. This place always hits the spot, and I love how they prepared The Impossible Burger, way better than Burgatory."
"2.0","Our server was bad.  He brought us the wrong food twice, and we waited an hour for our entrees. It would have been more understandable if it was busy at the time.  Never asked to refill our water or coffee, and had to be flagged down when we needed anything.  Food-not bad, but not worth the wait."
"3.0","I stopped in for an early dinner and this place was packed. I always assume that's a great sign or at least that the food will be worth the wait...But for me the food here was just okay. I ordered a turkey burger with a side of tater tots. Then I waited...and waited. When my burger finally arrived I was too hungry to snap a pic but it was a bit disappointing. While I was glad it wasn't just an average turkey burger patty it was a bit dry and could have used a tad bit more seasoning. The tater tots were good but a little on the salty side. I was waiting to be blown away and it just didn't happen. But I'm not giving up on this place. I'd give them another try maybe when they aren't so busy (there were three events going on the night I went) and see if they can make me a fan."
"5.0","This bar was great! We got street parking right in front. It was free since it was a holiday. Not sure where you would park on a busier night. We tried to come here before the Steelers home game but we didn't plan accordingly because the whole town was there. We went on a random Monday night and the food and service was fantastic. When we got there music was playing in the background. We asked for the sound for the TV to hear the game and they gladly put it on for us even tho it wasn't a Pittsburgh game! Can't wait to go back to have the spinach dip. By far the best spinach dip I've ever eaten. I ate it even on the perogies and pretzel!!"
"4.0","I can see this rooftop beer garden being one of my frequent places once I make the move to the 'burgh (do yall say the 'burgh?).  Since it is the winter, the roof is enclosed but there is a balcony area if you want to brave the cold.  The balcony area has several lit up Christmas trees to add to the holiday spirit.  We sat at the bar and loved the decor and lighting.  The bartenders are very on top of their services here.Beer:  Order the pineapple ale!  It's tasty but low on alc % - we can't have it all, I guess.Bar snack:  Pork rinds - larger than life is all"
"5.0","Really good place nice atmosphere, they had the games in which was nice, the staff was very kind, quick and friendly, the food was really good I had the shrimp street tacos they where wonderful. The rice pilaf that came with it was bland and boring but it's rice ya know"
"5.0","Really excited to discover this new place in Lawrenceville that seriously rivals BRGR and Burgatory.  Excellent farm-to-restaurant freshly ground burgers, locally sourced everything.  Everyone was friendly, food was delicious!  Definitely will return soon!"
"4.0","The sandwiches here are awesome, just like being home in New York.  I got the Prociutto sandwich with fresh mozzarella and it was to die for... The soft, fresh roll really made it all work together... Simply delicious!  Highly recommend, as the lines outside would indicate!"
"3.0","Came in on a Monday, found out it was $5 mini burgers. The waitress recommended getting 2 since they are small. {think JBC Wendy's} I usually only get 1 JBC so I figured I'd be good.  I ordered the polish hill- it was very good- pierogi grilled onions mayo. I got the rosemary fries $3 upcharge... in my opinion not worth the $3 I couldn't eat them the rosemary was too overwhelming. The fries would have been good without- crispy almost shoestring fries.  I should have gotten 2 burgers I was still hungry after- but it could have been that I didn't eat the fries.  $8.55 for a mini burger and inedible fries and water is a bit much."
"5.0","I was here on the weekend late night. The place look interested. I were there with group of my friends.I order salmon sashimi and sushi. It was so fresh. I love this the best. My friends order whole squids, ramen, and grill pork. Everything so delicious.    Our sever was friendly, I think I found the best sushi place. Obviously, I will be back again."
"4.0","My Chirashi bowl was on point. The raw scallop may have been my favorite fish in there! I'd never had raw scallops until a recent trip to NYC and they are divine when fresh! Since I'm gluten free, I wasn't able to order most of the Yatai menu. The one dish we ordered, the Zucchini Dengaku (pan fried zucchini, ground chicken,togarashi, beets, saikyo miso sauce) was a bit disappointing. I just could have done with a little more flavor, it fell a little flat. You should definitely make a reservation, it's a tiny place and I had to make mine at least a week in advance. I'd caution even more time if you have a larger party."
"3.0","Good food, decent portion size but pricey.  Great atmosphere.  Beware that they DO NOT accept cash."
"4.0","I had a nice time here. Professional and friendly bartender open late and serving food until one. Hard to beat downtown."
"4.0","I'm from California and hotcakes is something that's not common in our food vocabulary. We just settle on pancakes and call it a day.My brother took me and my mother to Pamela's for brunch and it was pretty packed. Fortunately, it was only a 10 minute wait and a huge crowd came in after us. I glanced through the menu and learned that they're known for their specialty hotcakes. They all looked very good, but settled on the the strawberry hotcakes (was craving strawberries). We finally got seated, ordered what we want, and chilled in the lively atmosphere of the diner. The food came out relatively fast and I was ecstatic for my hotcakes. They use FRESH strawberries instead of the syrupy strawberries in a can! The hotcakes were thin like a crepe and the crispy edges were the best part. A bit heavy on the butter, but that's how you get the crispiness. The sour cream surprisingly worked well with the strawberries, as it balanced out the sweetness from its tart element. As for the brown sugar, that was like the cherry on top. It was pure harmony.Definitely check it out when you're in Pittsburgh!"
"4.0","Great foodGreat service Very cleanVery busy on game day Maybe they should expand it"
"5.0","Went here before a show, great happy hour! Their soft pretzel sticks are reminiscent of the Rum Runners pretzels I used to love so dear. I will be back before any and all Pirates games for these delicious sticks of heaven. They were training a new waiter the night I was in and the service was incredible!"
"5.0","Update: My last two visits here, much better experience and I'd put them on or with the North Side location. Amazing subs as always, better experience with the staff.I love Peppi's. For my money there's no sub spot in Pittsburgh I'd rather go. I find myself coming to this location a lot as the Strip District is convenient. That being said, I have several gripes about this location as opposed to the North Side one I also frequent.(Redacted)That being said, the food is still delicious. The location is just as 'rustic' as all of the other spots. But if you want a more pleasant experience I'd recommend the North Side location."
"5.0","I've been frequenting the Strip District for breakfast for many years now, but found myself looking for a change of pace (in addition to--and more importantly--some pancakes), and Yelp led me to Cafe Raymond. For some reason the Strip makes me feel like a tourist in my own city (in a good way!), and Cafe Raymond reinforced that as soon as I walked in. Very warm, bright, and inviting, I hopped into a line that moved quickly to place my order. The blueberry ricotta pancakes had been the reason that Cafe Raymond caught my eye on Yelp in the first place, so I put in my order and sat down to enjoy my coffee (which may have been from La Prima--it was delicious!) to ride out the short wait to my pancakes.Now these pancakes... did not disappoint. I had been jonesing pancakes for days before this visit, and they were perfectly dense yet still fluffy and not too heavy, having a generous amount of blueberries dotted throughout. It came with whipped cream (which I was initially not super excited about, but after taking a bite, the effect of blueberries and cream came through) as well as local maple syrup on the side. It was a generous portion and I left full.I would love to come back to sample the lunch menu--other folks around me looked like they had some delicious sandwiches and salads. Service was friendly and fast."
"1.0","Would never try this food truck if you paid me. They were at grist house for dads and dogs and they were blocking the only sidewalk handicap entrance for wheelchairs on the block, and we had our 92 year old grandmother with us in a wheelchair. After watching us struggle with her and lifting her entire chair onto the sidewalk, we let them know they were blocking it and that no one could get through with a wheelchair if they needed to get through and then responded with a shrug and 'it's a city ordinance, we can park here'.  Like no apology, no care at all that we were struggling with a 92 year old grandparent. They literally could have moved their truck forward A FOOT and we could have fit her wheelchair onto the sidewalk. Rude. Overpriced. No thanks"
"5.0","This place was amazing. The food was great. I had an awesome healthy salad. I have some chicken in it. 450 calories not bad for lunch.The line was long but super quick Service."
"4.0","I visited Cinderlands for the 2nd time and thought I should update my review! We visited on a Sunday evening around 6:00 pm- it wasn't too busy at the time and we found a table easily. Last time I visited, I was a little disappointed that I didn't try more beers, so I made a point to try more this time! First and foremost, the descriptions for the beers are ON POINT. They perfectly describe the flavors of the beer and the magic that happens in your mouth. Although they don't have a large selection of beer, I am totally ok with that at a brewery, because they are actually making these beers from scratch. I was also personally excited to see they had two sours on tap, as sour beers are my current FAV. Here are the beers I tried:Grizzled Canary: Lemony aroma with a sour and slightly sweet taste and a hint of herb in the back of your tongue. REALLY good. 4/5Bog Whipper: Carbonated orange citrus goodness. Deliciously sour. 3.5/5Midnight Ramble: Literally tastes like a dark chocolate and raspberry chocolate bar. Dark tartness and the raspberry is there at the end. Full bodied and robust. 4/5I loved the beer. For food, the boyfriend went with the spicy fried chicken sandwich (bleu cheese dressing / iceberg lettuce / pickles / martin's potato roll / $14) without the blue cheese dressing. I went with the winter salad (radicchio / belgian endive / fennel / red onion / cara cara orange / quince sherry mustard vinaigrette / $8) and the 'sweet potato' (parmesan tempura / muhamarra / aleppo sumac honey / pickled chiles / cilantro / mint / $12) which was basically steamed sweet potato that was then fried (so it was super soft on the inside and crispy on the outside), served with a spicy indian-like sauce, herbs, and drizzled with honey. The sweet potato dish was absolutely delicious, but it is really spicy, so be cautious when ordering! The winter salad was not very good- it was entirely too bitter. All of the veggies are essentially pretty bitter on their own and the dressing didn't really take any bitterness away. The cara cara orange was also pretty bitter. I wouldn't order that again. Bren liked his sandwich a lot, but wasn't a fan of the seasoning on the fries. Later in the evening, we met up with a group of friends here and I tried the spent grain chicharrones ($7) which are crispy and thin and I think it's so cool they make them with grains from their beer brewing process. What a cool way to re-purpose the grains! They were delicious and the beer cheese they were served with was good as well.Overall, I had a great time at Cinderlands. I really want to come back and try more beers- especially when they do another collaboration with the Pittsburgh Juice Company!"
"4.0","Wow this place has a fantastic happy hour deal! You can try 3 sliders for the price of a normal burger, which gave me the chance to try out several interesting combinations. I particularly like the Fox Chapel Burger and love the way they keep the ground beef patties loosely packed. The draft beer list is also quite extensive, and they had a few fruity beers which my fianc√©e liked. The only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is that I think the burgers are overpriced during non happy hour - - indeed you can get a slightly less inventive yet still solid burger at nearly any bar along this street. Burgh'ers whips up delicious burgers but I would be here more often if they were just a dollar or two cheaper."
"4.0","Enjoyed my meal at Cinderlands. Bar area is small and you can see your cook make your food from your seats. I had the spices chicken sandwich which was crispy on the outside and juicy on inside.  My one complaint was it wasn't spicy at all but I would definitely get again. Wife got the sourdough pulled pork which was fantastic. The pepper seasoning made it different then other pulled porks I tasted. Best part of meal was the fries. Soooo good. Shoestring with salt and vinegar. Best I had in  a while. They have a small tap list but all were very good. Would eat here again."
"5.0","My lunch here was fantastic. The owner is clearly a very nice woman who takes pride in the fact that she owns a small little shop in upper Lawrenceville. The quality of the groceries are phenomenal and the community experience is really one-of-a-kind. I stop in and get a sandwich every now and again when I'm in the neighborhood and I'm always sure to mention it to folks who are looking for a quick lunch on the go. If I lived in the neighborhood I would shop here all the time."
"5.0","I stopped here earlier today with my wife for lunch.  The previous day I had read an online article that Cinderlands Brewing was opening the next day.  Since the infamous Lawrenceville Cookie Walk was going on I thought it would be a great day to grab lunch with my wife and then do the cookie tour.  We arrived to the restaurant right around 11:30 and were told we were the first sit down customers which was pretty cool.  They proceeded to take us to the back room which is a fairly open space with some cool string lighting.  Beyond that they also had a front room with booths on one side and a bar on the other.  Last but not least it looked like they had some seating upstairs as well. As I often do whenever I visit new breweries I decided to order a flight of beer.  They didn't exactly have a flight but instead had 5 oz pours for $2.50 and so I ordered all 5. All of the beers were actually really good with my favorites of the bunch being the passionfruit whipper (it reminded me of Hawaii) and the IPA (bright and hoppy) which should surprise no one who knows me.  Then for our lunch my wife and I started with spent grain chiccarones (vegan except for the beer cheese) and I went with the brisket sandwich for my entree.  Our chiccarones came out first and they were absolutely delicious.  The chiccarones themselves were light and crispy and dipping them into the beer cheese was heaven.  The beer cheese was good enough that I probably would have eaten just about anything in it.  After we had finished with our appetizers the entrees came out.  Both my entree and my wife's looked great and we dug in.  The brisket sandwich was tasty as the exterior bread of the sandwich had a nice crust to it (a baguette) while the inside was meaty and juicy. The brisket was super tender and tasty and I especially enjoyed the red cabbage addition to it.  I only wish that the mustard which I got on the last 1/4 of the sandwich had been more evenly spread.  It came with a side of fries which were also really good and seasoned nicely.  They were super thin (almost shoestring) which allowed them all to be crispy without a single one being overdone.  The only miss on the dish for me was the tallo aioli but that probably goes down to a personal preference instead of it actually being not good. My wife ended up loving her Brassica which had some great Thai flavors to it.The bottom line for me is I would head back here again in the future.  All of their beers were really good (some of the best that I have had recently) and their food was delicious too!  As far as a grand opening goes it was incredibly successful too as everything ran smoothly and we even had both the chef and owner talk to us before we left."
"3.0","Stumbling around on Friday night in Oakland, my friend and I found ourselves needing some food.  Luckily we landed ourselves in Little Nipper's before we ate our arms off.  We needed grease.. more importantly, we needed wings.Though they took a while to come out and charged me like $7 bucks for a half dozen single wings, they were satisfying..  If I needed wings and I was in Oakland, I would certainly go back."
"4.0","I've been wanting to try this place for a while. It was a little hard to find. If I hadn't read the other reviews we wouldn't have known to keep going up the steps. But upon walking in, you're transformed to an izakaya in Japan! The takoyaki was by far the best thing we had and would highly recommend trying them! The shumai and gyoza were also a huge hit with our group. I wasn't thrilled with the tonkatsu ramen personally but others enjoyed it. This is a hidden gem well worth finding!"
"3.0","I have to say I wasn't really impressed by this place.  Is it cool?  Yeah, of course.  Anytime you have a rooftop beer garden in downtown it's quite awesome.  The view is amazing, but that cannot make up for the lack of customer care.It's a bit confusing to reach here.  You need to take a forever slow elevator to reach the rooftop.  Then when you get out you have to show your ID up top.  How about you have a person downstairs at the elevator entrance to bypass this.  That way you can make a swift entrance upstairs.Getting up top, it's nice looking and huge.  But everyone seems to want to be up here.  Lots of people everywhere attempting to stake their claim at a table.  Makes for a hard time to move about.Service, spotty at best.  For me I found that going to the bar myself to get my drink was faster than waiting for a server to get it to me.  I watched as my friends placed orders with their server.  While this happened, I went over to the bar and got my drink and returned to the table way before my friends' drinks arrived at the table.If I wanted sub par service I would have went to any other bar in the city."
"4.0","By far my favorite Chinese place in the city! Hot and sour is good, egg rolls are big, crab rangoons are very good and the fried rice is great. The entrees that I have tried are good as well."
"5.0","Stopped in for lunch. Very nice staff and ordered the Rueben sandwich and it was amazing. Can't wait to come back for breakfast ."
"4.0","I've been meaning to try this place ever since I heard the news we had a Burgh'ers opening. I had no idea whether or not it was affiliated with the Burgh'ers I had years ago in Harmony, PA but I secretly hoped it was because it was the best burger I ever had. That chance finally came when I saw Burgh'ers listed on the Pittsburgh restaurant week specials. After much debating I went with the Mexican war burger simply because it was something different and because Good Food Pittsburgh labeled it as one of the top 10 dishes to try for restaurant week. Typically it's not the burger I would have chosen but why not try something new, right?! I was very pleased with my decision. The burger was cooked perfectly and the flavors blended together so well. I was sad to see it slowly disappear. This is one place I will definitely be visiting again and again. I would highly recommend people try it if they haven't already. As I write this I'm already thinking about when I can go back."
"5.0","I hopes I discovered them early during my short trip in Pittsburgh. Their pastries are amazing."
"1.0","Worst buffalo chicken pizza I have ever had in my life. Biggest waste of money EVER smh. I ate half a slice of burnt pizza with dried up hard cheese and 'chicken' that didn't even look like chicken and threw an entire medium pizza in the trash that cost 18$. There was no sauce at all. This place is a joke. Had to order pizza from another place. Don't bother wasting your money here. AND delivery took an hour. I will be making sure none of my friends go here anymore. Don't wanna support this business. Hope it shuts down and a better pizza place opens up instead."
"5.0","As a refugee from Hurricane Irma I am highly sensitive to any 'dis' or slight of any kind at this moment in time. I almost got locked up after an incident at the Carnegie Museum of Art when an overzealous guard tried to confiscate my elderly mother's backpack (purse). It was a Pyrrhic victory as I was still shaking with rage when I arrived here for dinner... But the SS Irma couldn't have docked at a friendlier port!!! I am a huge fan of the Capital Grille in Boca so this was like coming home! It felt like a parallel universe as this place was also loaded with snooty oil paintings, dead animals and gorgeous chandaliers (just like the one I love at home). Absent were the obsequious servers I have known for years and instead I was treated to a more urbane dining experience! My waitress was very friendly but I wasn't treated like a nineteenth century Victorian, in colonial India, like I usually am at the one in Boca... It was actually quite refreshing!!! A member of our group was suffering from the effects of exotic room service (which we've been subsisting on at the Fairmont) and we had to leave early but this hardly fazed our hosts! They wrapped up our delicious food (some of which was way off menu) and sent us happily on our way... Anyone who turns their nose up at this fine city and its excellent restaurants is a fool!! This Capital Grille is just as good as the one in Boca and I highly recommend it to any and all!"
"1.0","Worse food, uncooked chicken, too much oil. Never seen tikka masala too red, too oily and almost no cream."
"4.0","I'm giving it a 4 but honestly, I'm somewhere in between a 3 and 4. I think I walked in with high expectations - I wasn't disappointed, but I also wasn't wow'ed. This was my first stop in Pittsburgh. Apparently Obama has dined here and this was the place to be. I didn't actually do my own research, just let my friend guide me along. The hotcakes are no doubt delicious. They are like huge crepes filled with your choice of fruit pretty much and a ton of whipped cream. We actually shared one banana walnut hotcake and it was plenty. Definitely a great deal. We could've just ordered that and been full. However, we also ordered the corned beef hash. This  was an extremely heavy dish. It was also really salty. It comes with toast too. Huge portions, delicious food, great prices. That's definitely where the 4 is coming from. For me, the food was just too heavy and buttery, so much so that I don't know if I would come back.  Personally, I prefer my fluffy, fruity pancakes. With all that said - If you're visiting, it is still worth a stop."
"4.0","we poped in after a light morning sprinkle...its a smallish quite space that we like...the big macaroon was the best item we tasted...i did like the fact that the cros didnt shatter in our laps, i prefer this bake over a crusty exploding crumb cros...the quiche texture was a little soft and it was light tastewise...the gourmandise was disappointing though...all in all a good start to the day..."
"4.0","Love having this little market in my neighborhood! Great place to get some delicious coffee (from Zeke's), a snack, or some fresh produce for dinner. Also, everyone is SUPER friendly. Can't wait to come back and try out their sandwich menu."

"4.0","Awesome cocktails, I'm an old fashion kinda guy and they are one of the best I have had in pittsburgh. Have not eaten there yet but I will soon. TK"
"5.0","Wow! This is one of my new favorite places and probably in my top 5 places to eat in Pittsburgh now. That naan seriously! Get the naan. They have super generous portions. I think enough to share a whole meal with someone. Everything I've had here is excellent! It is also nice that it is a little off the hustle and bustle of the strip and even have their own parking lot."
"4.0","Twelve has masterminds behind their businesses. This taco place is so so so delicious!! I can't rave how much I love the tacos here. It's a bit small on the inside, but that gives it more character. Eat everything!"
"4.0","Out with the taco and gourmet burger craze, and in with the fried chicken! Seriously, I feel like Nashville hot chicken is having a moment right now. It seems like every two seconds another chicken place is popping up, and that's a-okay with me!ChiKN's menu is fairly small and focuses on chicken (duh)...sandwiches, tenders, and some standard sides. I've been twice so far, and it didn't disappoint. The first time, I ordered tenders at spice level medium with a side of mac and cheese. When I asked for medium spice, the cashier warned that medium was very spicy....I guffawed and told her I'm sure I can handle it (I mean, it's only the midpoint of their scale, how hot could it be?) Welp, turns out I'm not the spice hero I thought I was, because the medium pretty much burned off my eyebrows and had me sweating like a snowman at a sauna as I powered through my meal. Heat aside, the food was stellar! The chicken was juicy, the breading was crisp, and the seasoning was super flavorful. The mac and cheese was also a standout, with a tangy, sharp white cheddar sauce that was a welcome relief to balance out Dante's Seventh Circle of Hell inside my mouth after a bite of chicken. Given my first experience with the heat level that was admittedly too spicy for me, I recently returned for a second visit (which was probably 6 weeks or so after the first) and ordered the same meal at one level down (mild). The food was still killer, but sadly, the spice pendulum swung way in the other direction.....pretty much no heat at all! I'm not sure if they've adjusted their spice scale since my first visit, or if it's just inconsistencies in the chefs, but it's disappointing to not be able to predict what kind of heat you're going to get. That being said, the chicken is still friggin delicious, spicy or not, so I'll certainly be returning for spice roulette again soon!One quick note about ambiance -- both times I was there they were playing pretty loud rap/hip-hop music that included some choice words (let's just say these weren't the clean, radio-friendly version of the songs!) I personally couldn't care less, but if you have young kiddos or other folks with you who would be offended by that, you might want to steer clear."
"5.0","Great local pizza shop. They have some of the best prices around. They put an add in the newer penny saver that comes to the house and it's one of the few pizza shops you can still get a large pizza at for under 10$. Will definitely go back."
"1.0","This place was awful for the service. The bartender was rude and disrespectful to me when coming in to pick up take out. He didn't have the bag tied up or prepared properly, so the heavy bag of food that had lots of contents in it, lost some of the items onto the floor when he handed it to me. He blames me for dropping the pasta and told me I was being rude for asking that it be bagged up better. I also mentioned that I was going to be running late because of this and that people are waiting for their Sunday dinner. He then said to me, oh so your running  late... that's too bad. I was embarrassed because other customers heard him talking to me this way and although it was an accident that pasta fell out of the bag, I was not upset just simply asking that it be fixed. But this bartender was completely rude and unkind. I don't believe you should feel embarrassed like this by a restaurant staff when coming into their establishment."
"3.0","I live a block away from Prince so I eat here frequently, but that's more a matter of convenience and price over taste.I usually opt for the dinner buffet, as it includes made to order naan at a fairly low price ($9 for eat in and $7 for takeout). The food at the buffet is hit or miss. The chicken tikka masala is acceptable but too creamy, and the chicken can be dry. Their tandoori chicken is great compared to other Oakland Indian spots, and the chicken curry is a bit bland but the chunks of dark meat chicken are tender and juicy.Vegetable entrees usually fare better than the meats. Chana (chickpeas) are meaty and hearty, the rajma (kidney beans) is spicy and bold, and most other vegetable offerings are decent albeit a bit greasy.Fresh naan is the best part of the meal, it's soft with a decent amount of char for a texturally rich bite. Don't order off the menu, the food isn't a big step up from the buffet and is overpriced (unless you get the tandoori meats, which are prepared quite well). Go to India Garden, Star of India, or Tamarind instead for a la carte.The dining room is surprisingly quiet yet very dimly lit, probably to save money on electric bills. Hindi music videos play on the TV, and they have a fridge appropriately stocked with Four Loko.In summary, go for cheap prices and middle of the road Indian food. Other Oakland Indian joints may do slightly better food, but not at such a great price."
"5.0","We were a party of 13  and a baby for a surprise 60th birthday dinner for my twin brother and me.  We had a private room and Bruce was our waiter.  He was awesome, knowledgeable, pleasant, professional and has honed his skills to perfection.   I had a filet, medium rare, with mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus. My filet was cooked perfectly, the mashed potatoes were the best I've ever had and the asparagus was perfectly grilled.  Everyone in our party raved about this being the 'best meal we've ever had'. The drinks were also amazing.  I had a Capital Cosmopolitan which was excellent.   The dessert menu looked delicious but we didn't have time to try it. The Capital Grille is expensive but worth every dollar spent on this dining experience.  I look forward to our next visit."
"1.0","Possibly the worst Indian food I have had in the United States so far and definitely the worst in Pittsburgh. I ordered a Lamb Biryani and it looked like they put lamb chunks in lemon rice. The Aloo Paratha which is one of the easiest things to make did not have aloo stuffing as much as you would like. Very disappointed with their food. I am never ordering from this place again. Just wasted my $20 bucks for nothing."
"3.0","I'm not sure how this place stays in business.  Every time I've been there, we are the only table in the restaurant....including a Saturday night at 6:30pm.   Well, maybe it's the fact that they overcharge for the amount of food they give you.  Quality is good, but the portions are too small for what you pay.  You also have to pay for parking (in the garage).   There's not too many Japanese restaurants in Pittsburgh, so if you're in the mood for Japanese,  it's virtually the only place to go."
"5.0","Never disappointed with anything at this location. Food is delicious, service is great, and location is convenient. Drink selection is large and the happy hour is a good deal too. Restaurant is always clean the multiple times we've been there both before and after shows and games. Only thing that I find annoying is that the manager (?) always wants to seat you upstairs. I get that they probably want it to look empty so people come in, but give people the option -don't just say 'is upstairs okay' when there's multiple empty tables you're standing 5 feet from.  Will continue to go back, and continue to sit on the main floor if I see open tables."
"1.0","Wow did this place go down hill!! We used to come here all the time about 10 years ago and it was great, we came back Sunday during Steelers Fan Fest and it was horrible. Hopefully Bettis just sells the place so something new can be opened here. The service was maybe the worst I've ever had anywhere. We asked to go outside and the waiter like freaked out that he hated going outside, so we offered to get our own beer and take it outside... took about 10 mins for the bartender to even ask what we wanted even tho no one else needed waited on. Had 1 beer outside and left, we will never return."
"5.0","My fav neighborhood spot, literally located inside my residential neighborhood!! Everything I've tried on the menu so far is excellent--fried fish, shrimp, and chicken wings; kabob salad; steak Moroccan burrito (yes they put Moroccan salad on the burritos and it's amazing!!) The Beta Bites sauce is the best thing about this place, but it's highly coveted and dispensed in small doses. Highly recommend!!"
"4.0","Took my girlfriend here for her birthday dinner. We split an excellent pizza and a bottle of Pinot Grigio. Prices were a little high for a college budget, but the service and food were amazing so it was definitely worth it!"
"5.0","Fresh food yum. I stopped by during Ramadan for the late night buffet! It's over at 10z for 16.99. It's a really great way to try everything they have to offer. I wish they had a few more options for veggies but other than that great food"
"3.0","I visited Sausalido last night, something I'd been meaning to do ever since I noticed it several months ago.  It was late on a Wednesday and the place was nearly empty, so we were promptly seated and delivered a plate of bread and a very tasty white bean dip with olive oil and balsamic.  As I enjoyed the appetizer, I took in my surroundings.  It's a small, cozy space, with a sort of modern, minimalist decor - tastefully done, in my opinion.  The menu presented a challenge, as there were many items that sounded promising.  We settled on scallops with wilted spinach and pancetta ($26) and gnocchi in tomato-basil ragout with braised lamb ($19).  The scallops were large, properly cooked and slathered with a very flavorful tomato-butter sauce.  The accompanying spinach, however, was a bit too salty even for this salt lover.  The gnocchi had good texture and flavor; unfortunately, it was done a disservice by the tomato-basil ragout, which tasted little of fresh tomatoes or basil.  The lamb was also a disappointment, as it was somewhat bland and rather tough and chewy.As we finished our meal, the owner/chef came out to ask us how it was, which I always appreciate.  I tried to give him some constructive criticism because I really want this place to succeed. I love the  concept: a neighborhood bistro with an eclectic menu based on fresh, seasonal ingredients.  At least on this night, however, the execution was wanting.  Don't get me wrong; I did enjoy my meal, but at this price range I expect more consistency and attention to detail.  I'll gladly return in a few months, eager to see if Sausalido has made progress in living up to its lofty potential."
"5.0","Fresh sandwiches, salads and homemade soups make this deli a winner. They are very friendly and the food is good. I love the variety and they have daily specials. I've been eating here a while and I've never been disappointed."
"4.0","Their Chicago-style pizza is delicious with chunks of seasoned tomatoes and gooey cheese nestled inside. Their other pizzas are quite tasty as well. Delivery is quick and easy. I can't speak to the authenticity of their Chicago pizzas, but I'll be returning many a time to Little Chicago's."
"5.0","SETTINGCute Victorian house with hardwood floors. Well lit and has enough space for small to medium parties. Casual. Feels like I am dining at a relative's house!FOODCame for the 'Sunday Dinner for Two' deal: 1 appetizer + 2 entrees + 1 bread (all for $25). Seriously, what a fantastic deal! Definitely filling too.Went with the Gobi Manchurian for the app. I'm not a huge fan of cauliflower because it looks like a mini albino tree and tastes like cardboard. That being said, if cauliflower was always done this way, then these albino trees would be deforested in a minute. Crunchy and delicious. First time I had Channa Batura and it was great! It was like a big puffy bread that could be peeled/ripped apart and dipped in the chickpea curry. Chickpeas are tasty and they have a cute name. Chickpea IN curry? Count me in.I'm a big fan of Saag because I like spinach and Popeye the sailor man. Chicken Saag was rich and just the right amount of creamy. Good quantity of tender chicken as well. SERVICE Waiters are knowledgeable about the menu and describe the dishes well if you have trouble understanding what you are ordering. Nice people. Very mellow and quiet personalities, which go with the atmosphere of this place.IMPRESSIONConvenient location and high quality food (with good deals on certain days) makes this place a must-visit if you are a fan of indian cuisine. Personally, I enjoy coming here for their deals and quality dishes, but I also enjoy their arch nemesis down the street if I am solely in the mood for buffet (more offerings there). Not much parking except in their 'driveway'. Oh, and I've always wondered what's upstairs...anyone know? A hidden albino forest, perhaps? *smacks lips*"
"5.0","This is an adorable little French cafe. I had their ham and cheese croissant which was heated and delicious. I also tried their macarons. Pistachio and salted caramel were ok but the raspberry and strawberry mint were terrific."
"5.0","As usual I left satisfied.  They changed the name of the place but the recipes are still the same.  The best Venezuelan Street food in the city by far. This time around I got the American Arepa along with my go to Arepa perico (breakfast). Have mercy on my taste buds. Cilantro sauce takes it over the top. Not to mention the owner now knows me by name because I order so much . Only bad thing is they close at 4 and you have to pay for parking."
"5.0","We don't get into town often, and had our first opportunity to eat here tonight. George was an amazing server and had great recommendations, as well as kept us laughing. The family tried some pasta and a burger and everything was very good. Good atmosphere and lots of TVs if you want to watch some sports. Highly recommend."
"5.0","This place is so great! I love the bowl options. It's great to have a quick meal that is actually healthy. I also love the design of the store itself. I was happy to Instagram there...and yes, that's actually important to me! Also, I got to chat with one of the owners and that was really cool! They are very into providing good service and great food!"
"5.0","Excellent food! But medium hot is not sufficient for me. However the music is a bit noisy. Fries tastes good and food served in around 3 mins at 4 pm. Overall it's gooooood place for sandwich and the whole combo takes only 11 dollars lol"
"5.0","Authetic portuguese food just like my vavo used to make! Friendly atmosphere, quick and capable service, delicious coffees and great prices. It's a regular stop for my husband and I. Highly recommended."
"5.0","Salem's caters to Pittsburgh's Muslim community and its halal restaurant runs the gamut of food from the Islamic world, from Pakistan to Libya. But folks of all nationalities and religions come here for their tasty, filling lunches. Being more partial to Pakistani food myself, I usually get their curry-and-rice special; you can pick up to three different kinds of meat preparations with either plain basmati rice or biryani, and the vegetable of the day. You HAVE to try the goat curry; it's rich and soulful with tender meat. I also love the creamy chicken tikka masala and the neon red chicken tandoori. It's huge and you won't need dinner after! The market is great for your Middle Eastern and South Asian specialties, as well as your various halal meats; I grew up eating kosher meat and I think halal/kosher meat tastes cleaner than regular meat. Also a really cool selection of sweets that remind me of my childhood with my nominally Sephardic grandparents.A fun gem in the Strip!"
"5.0","This is one of the best Indian restaurant I have been in Pittsburgh and anything closer to south indian food in taste and quality."
"4.0","If you are a fan of Indian food then this is the place for you.  The market has a private lot where you are warned to park at your own risk but makes it handy since parking in the Strip district can be a nightmare.On one side is the market where you can purchase all types of meats and canned goods, etc to prepare and Indian style meal. The other side is cafeteria style where you can order meals, salads, gyros, or sandwiches.Since I was having lunch with my son he ordered his favorite which was tandoori chicken and chili chicken. It came with vegetables and an Indian rice platter. I decided to settle for a lamb gyro since there was a sign that stated ' if you are ordering a prepared entree please allow 10 minutes.' This is just a heads up if you are on a lunch hour as my son was. Cards and cash are accepted. If you order a sandwich or gyro then for a slight upcharge you can get French fries and a beverage of choice. You can order as take out as well.First of all portion sizes are enormous! For Indian food yes it is very spicy including the vegetables that caught me by surprise!  The lamb gyro was just okay but I really enjoyed the French fries! My son and I were sharing our dishes and believe me we both ended up taking food home with us.I would recommend that if you come here then as another reviewer noted bypass the gyros and prepared sandwiches and go for the authentic Indian food. Most of these foods are very spicy. However, I must say that you'll never go wrong with their French fries. They are one of the best I have anywhere!"
"4.0","On Wednesday I was part of a group of 12 Penn State wrestling fans that was here for an early dinner. They were very accommodating and the food and service was great. George and Clara were our servers and did a fantastic job. I will definitely be back and strongly recommend this place!!!"
"4.0","I got the chicken tender (3) with level 3 spicy. Their spicy level is very good. The chicken is pretty crispy. Few concerns are their dining space are not well clean. I think they bare wipe the table and there are flies flying around. They only use peanut oil so my friend with with peanut allergies cannot eat here"
"5.0","I came to Burghers on a Saturday around 2:45 not realizing they did not open until 4. A guy whom I assuming is the owner insisted that I stay and be served so I took a seat at the bar. I ordered the Polish Hill which is a burger with cheese, caramelized onions, and pierogies. It was cooked to a perfect medium and tasted great. Unfortunately they don't have their liquor license yet but the bartender, Randolf, was nice enough to offer me one of the beers that had been given to them from a rep free of charge. Free beer is always the way to my heart! I will definitely be returning and telling friends!"
"5.0","Great breakfast brunch place, it makes you feel like you are in Europe. Ambience and decor just beautiful, patio with umbrellas must see! Crepes are bomb! If your in bloomfield area, give a try!"
"4.0","Are you looking for something open late??? This taco place is slamming! It was packed shoulder to shoulder but well worth the wait. While chilling they had music playing, people singing, and vibing. Every one was just enjoying each other until their order was called. Believe me when I say nobody made it to there cars without eating at least 1 taco, FACTS!!!! The taste was everything! Tacos after hours is definitely a GO for me especially here! Pittsburgh can catch me here every time I come."
"4.0","Walking to Point State Park for fireworks on the 4th when the wife and I stopped in. Thankfully it wasn't too busy considering how many people were roaming around downtown. We were immediately seated and brought waters. Since it was our first time in we asked for a burger and wing recommendation. I appreciated the waiters forthrightness in steering us toward tried and true favorites. We ended up splitting the Mountain Climber burger and a 6-count of Cajun Ranch traditional wings. (Because it was a dry rub we were very grateful we got traditional). The burger was well cooked, the fries were well seasoned and our only complaint was that the onion straws tasted as though they'd been sitting out a while and had gotten a little too soft. Wings were quite good and tasted a bit like Cool Ranch Doritos. Wish it wasn't an extra buck for Ranch drip, but just a heads up. Reasonable price, good portions, clean environment."
"5.0","Went here last night because of its proximity to the August Wilson Center, where we had tickets to a show.  I wasn't expecting much.  I know the meatball place is very popular, but meatballs just don't thrill me like they do many others.  I could not have been more pleased.  Between us we ordered the scallop special (smoky and perfectly cooked), an arugula salad (perfectly dressed and buried under lots of fluffily grated parm), and the grilled shrimp (not what your expecting, carefully curated and balanced work of art on a plate).  Our server, Emily, who expertly made us some espresso drinks to end the night, was exceptional.  A+ on everything: delicious balanced cuisine, great wines, fast and thoughtful service, and amazing coffee.  We left very happy and on time for our show."
"4.0","We used to live in the Zelienople area, so we frequented the Harmony location ever since it opened. We were down in Lawrenceville for the cookie tour and decided to give this location a try. Three people in our party (including myself) ordered the old standby: the Shadyside burger (mayo, mushrooms and caramelized onions). They make fantastic burgers; although for the price, they could be a little larger (we always had the same complaint about the Harmony location). You must pair your burger with the shoestring fries. Home run right there. Although the salad with the honey vinaigrette is also a solid pick. Service was solid and the food arrived quickly. They were offering $5 drafts (we visited on a Saturday afternoon). Cool vibe and ample seating."
"5.0","Great cocktails, great service, great atmosphere, great food! Just AMAZING. They have great specials and events, fresh local food, and amazing drinks. Definitely a must when you are near the Mt. Washington area!"
"5.0","10/10 recommend! I love their sausage, egg & cheese croissant breakfast sandwich and the blueberry pancakes are out of this world - Seriously don't leave without trying one! I love going here for weekend brunch. It's so cozy, the food is so good, and the staff are all so kind. Try it out if you've never been!"
"3.0","Breakfast sandwiches were tasty.  We had a breakfast burrito and egg white avocado sandwich.  They were out of avocado and substituted guacamole instead.  The watermelon mint drink was ok, not as refreshing as I hoped."
"3.0","We came here for our anniversary dinner wanting to do something more casual and it was really just ok.  We loved the decor inside but there was a limited amount of tables so we ended up sitting at the bar.  The bartender was not overly friendly and I felt like could have done more for us.  Really just ok"
"4.0","Great bar inside. Real cheap and the atmosphere is that of a nice dive. The pizza and the rest of the food is highly underrated. If working nearby I always order when pizza is brought up. Great location."

It features one of the best old fashioned's in the world lol.. like seriously... the have great custom drinks that r delicious.. had garage doors for a open air feel.. friendly bartenders and place serves some very tasty and well presented food.. I would def recommend you try this place"
"5.0","Great hand crafted tacos using fresh, local ingredients? S√≠! (SNL Stefan voice while covering nose and mouth) This place has everything...pork, beef, chicken, vegan, pop in glass bottles and fancy, churched up black beans. Friendly service, fun atmosphere (although small) and window seats for watching the fabulous ebb and flow that is Carson street foot traffic. When it comes to tortillas you have two options, flour or corn. My advice is corn...you won't be disappointed. I went for lunch yesterday and ordered the bbq chicken special , the pork and a bottle of Pepsi. Total damage was $8. Great lunch spot, and word is that they are open until 3am on Fri and Sat for those saturated folks leaving the bars and not too keen on pizza."
"3.0","Go here to watch games if you are downtown.  So many TVs, great amount of bar space and two floors of tables.  The food is pretty good; it's bar food!Get the wings with the hot buffalo sauce, you will not be disappointed."

"2.0","Big time Fumble So I guess I went there on an off night.   My colleagues and I were there for dinner and while the place was say half busy it seems the front of the house was in chaos.  The waitstaff were nice but the meal really took a turn.  It seems they were badly under staffed and it shows.  So the first odd thing was our drinks we're served in plastic cups,  maybe this is a thing there or maybe they did not have enough clean glass ware?  It seems very out of place to me in what is a high brow look.  The meal took close to 40 minutes to come out and it was meh.  I ordered the chicken pasta and parts were cold, my guess sitting in the window too long.  Other dishes were a chicken club and fish tocos, none of which should've required 40 minutes. I also ordered a second drink that never came,  I'm not sure if the bartender or server dropped the ball there.The bathroom was messy, garbage over flowing, one stall had not toilet paper, another had a light out. When I asked to see the manager I was informed that she was on the line cooking and could not come out to talk.  I did get my drink comped and left but for me, an out of town guy, what should've been a once in a lifetime experience was an experience in really meh service"
"5.0","The hot bar, specifically the lamb, makes for a pretty amazing meal. I can't speak for the chicken or meatballs, but for $10 you get a huge lamb shank plus rice and sides. Not only are the portions huge, but the meat is super soft and full of flavor, and the bone comes apart with ease. Clearly, they've been stewing that stuff for hours. Plus, you get a couple sides to go along with the meal. This is definitely a good option for something different in Oakland, and if you come in between 2 and 4p they discount the meal by another $2."
"5.0","Had lamb with rice, lentils and loubia beans. It was obviously homemade and outstanding!  The owners are very friendly and love to cook their traditional moroccon foods. Well worth a try. You won't be disappointed."
"1.0","i have so many bad experience with this restaurant.today, it took an hour to get my food delivered.one of them was oreo cheesecake. it was shattered--looked like someone dropped on the floor. and the person on the phone at the restaurant don't know how to handle this situation. when the customer says something is wrong with what they have received, you need to apologize.i will never ever going to order from this restaurant again."
"1.0","We were so excited to check this this place out. We went on a Saturday and the place was packed. The host told us it would be awhile for a table and we told him we would take our chances at the bar. He told us they were at maximum capacity and that we had to leave. It didn't look that bust at all... we could have easily got to the bar. Guess they didn't want our business that bad. Super disappointing. Won't ever go back."
"5.0","We went for restaurant week. The service was excellent! Amber gave a great explanation of the choices and the extras that could be added. She is definitely an asset for Capital Grille. The steak filets and rubs were perfectly prepared. We will definitely be back."
"4.0","This has become my go-to pizza spot in the south side for 3 reasons. I'll expand below. 1. It's fast and easy to order (online)2. The price is great for the amount of food you get 3. The food is consistently good1. The online ordering is efficient and I've never had to deal with showing up at the store and them not having my order ready. You can order from your desktop or mobile. The order process is easy and you can pay with your card or select paying with cash.2. I've tried many other pizza places in the south side area who charge $20+ for a large pizza that really isn't that great. Gennaro's allows you to get a large amount of food for under $20. My go-to order is a 1 topping medium pizza and 1 order of cheese twists (think pepperoni roll type of goodness). The total is just over $19 which is a great deal. The hoagies there are also HUGE if you get the full size. 3. The food is good. Not great, certainly not horrible but it's good. The crust is usually soft and they have a good cheese to sauce ratio for my liking. I've only had the red sauce selection so I can't speak to the many specialty white pizzas they offer. The twists are delicious and make a great addition to any order. The breadsticks are big and fluffy. The only item that I had and would not get again are the wings. The wings were basically deep fried wings with bbq sauce poured over them, they didn't take the time to toss them and get them nice and saucy. Overall if you're looking for solid affordable pizza in the south side Gennaro's is a great option."
"5.0","Service was amazing!! George was really quick and such a nice guy. He was very personable and we didn't have to wait on anything he was very competent. Food was amazing and reasonably priced. If you get the chance get dessert do it because it was awesome."
"4.0","Loved the crazy Bloody Mary! We got ours topped with shrimp, bacon, and a whole soft shell crab!!! The food is good but I just probably ordered the wrong thing. I got the lobster roll tinder style and I was a little overwhelmed by the bread and french fries. The lobster and bisque were great but I should have ordered a different side! Can't wait to go back and try the sushi!"
"4.0","Went here for the first time with some coworkers today.  Having some familiarity with Venezuelan food I was excited to try an arepa.I had the 'best friend' combo of an arepa, empanada, and a drink.I like places that are fast, affordable, and good.  This place is all three.  I'll definitely be back!"
"4.0","Very good sushi for a shopping mall. A little pricey for the location. Good selection but the platters save some money. Worth a re-visit."
"4.0","First of all, despite the fact that Rialto has indoor seating, it's not exactly the type of place that you'd want to hang out in.  They have TVs that are usually tuned to sports, but they're more for the staff than for you.  Rialto is the type of place you order your food for delivery or you go and pick it up.That being said, they have some of the best and most creative pizza in Pittsburgh.  Their steak and fries pizza is always one that we get when we have friends in from out of town.  The Giant, while being a little more costly per square inch -- yes we did the math on this -- is always impressive when you bring it home to a group of ravenous friends.  The pizza is well done, not overly greasy, and generally a good price.  If you're someone who lives in Greenfield or Squirrel Hill you owe it to yourself to check them out (actually, if you're in Greenfield, they're the best pizza in the neighborhood)."
"5.0","This is a place that I am not one to pass up if I'm in the area! Doce Taqueria is a very small, authentic taco joint located in the heart of South Side. My fianc√© and I happened to stumble upon it a few months ago, and I find myself craving these tacos frequently! It is very cramped when you walk in and not much space to eat, but we've been able to find a spot each time we were there. My fianc√© and I both love the Pollo Taco- he gets it as is, but I just get it with cheese and lettuce and then put their habanero hot sauce on it. The chicken is so tender and delicious! You are able to choose if you want flour or corn tortillas, and are basically able to choose exactly how you want your tacos. Absolutely delicious!!"
"3.0","I love chicken in all of its forms. This place is well designed. The employees are friendly, competent and execute well. The restaurant is nicely designed and clean. The menu is simple and as promoted. However, The product has a major issue - too much seasoning. I love chicken, spice, seasoning, breading and everything to do with all that. The issue is that the seasoning is so heavy you can almost 'feel' it. I don't mean taste it, I mean feel it.....as in gritty. This chicken is seemingly  well prepared but completely ruined by being doused, like with a fire hose, with gritty seasoning. If they would back off they would have a hit. Just back off, just a little, and you will have something."
"1.0","I found three, thick, long hairs on my food. Super disappointing. Aside from that, I used to get this all the time years ago and it unfortunately no longer stands up. Super gross and disappointing. But like THREE HAIRS!!"
"4.0","A bit pricy, but I think it's worth it. Their food is great, service is great, and presentation in the restaurant is wonderful. It's my go-to chinese when I'm downtown. Definitely a must try."
"5.0","Outstanding breakfast! Had scrambled eggs and chorizo hash....yummy! The hash was nice with a bit of spice, eggs were fluffy and cooked to perfection. Just be aware that they only accept cash."
"5.0","LOVE Thai Gourmet. I've lived in Bloomfield for 3 years and have never even tried Thai Cuisine because I would never stray from my beloved Thai Gourmet. Their prices are great, and each entree can be stretched into two or even three meals. When you order to-go, they sometimes throw in a surprise little treat which is always delicious. The service is great in the restaurant. Very quick and your water glass will never even get close to empty. The decor inside is a little eclectic, but that's part of the charm. The only word of caution I would provide is that the spice level can be a little inconsistent sometimes...unless last just my tolerance. Err on the side of caution and you'll be fine."
"4.0","Food: 1) vegetable samosa 2) chicken tikka masala 3) special chicken biryani 4) bread bowl. The food was more than enough to feed three people.The basmati rice was beautifully cooked to a nice fluffiness. The chicken tikka masala was very tender and lean. The chicken biryani had a bit of a kick to it, as the chicken was spicy. Naan was phenomenal. Overall, delicious.Service was extremely hospitable. Restaurant was first floor of a house, which was quaint."
"4.0","If you're into SPICY Thai, this is your spot. My date and I stopped in for lunch and we got their lunch special - curry and either a sring roll or soup. We opted for lemongrass soup, summer rolls, a green curry and a panang curry. The summer rolls were excellent and the lemongrass was seasoned very well. I would like to see more veggies in it other than just a few mushrooms. I ordered a 7/10 for my curry and it was by far one of the spiciest dishes I have ever eaten. And I love spicy food! I've had Thai HOT at other Thai restaurants and it wasn't as hot as my curry. WOW! I had to pack up most to go because the spicy level was slowing me down. I ate the rest as a late dinner and again, nearly burned my mouth off. The staff was friendly and helpful and we were pleased by our experience. Prior to dining in, I had only ordered pickup multiple times. The portions match the price and I look forward to going back next time I'm in town."
"1.0","This place is disgusting I can't believe I ate this pizza look at the state of the restroom"
"3.0","I visited this restaurant with a friend for lunch a week ago.  We were having an informal lunch meeting to talk about some business, so I suggested this place and a couple of others that were convenient for both of us.  She chose Prince of India, so we both met up here around noon.Technically, I'd been once before, but I hadn't actually eaten anything here because I'd already had dinner, so I count this as being my first time.  The food is your typical Indian buffet fare, including chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, saag, pita bread, navratan korma, and rice on the hot bar, and several vegetables and sauces on the cold bar.  I picked up some of all of the aforementioned dishes, plus some cucumber yogurt sauce from the cold bar.  I found the food pretty average in quality for Indian buffet food--not great, but not horrible, either.  Because I wasn't terribly impressed, I stuck with one plate, and didn't go for seconds.At the time of our visit, the dining room was pretty quiet, so it was a good place to have a business lunch.  (Indeed, I spotted one of my supervisors in the row of tables on the other side talking to a colleague...)  The decor is pretty nondescript for an Indian restaurant, with one TV playing Bollywood music videos in the back.If you study or work at Pitt or UPMC, be sure to bring your ID to take advantage of the $1 discount.  The lunch buffet price is $9, which is pretty average for the area.  Given the average food, average decor, average prices, and even average service, the main thing this place has going for it is convenience for those who work in Oakland.  If you're able to do so, I'd recommend walking down Atwood or over to Craig to check out the superior Indian offerings there.  However, if you need a quiet, uncrowded place for lunch and don't want to walk any further than Fifth Ave., Prince of India will do just fine."
"4.0","We love this place. I have never had a bad meal here. The staff is pleasant and attentive. The food is great and the prices are reasonable. Convenient to both sports venues and Stage AE. Highly recommend."
"5.0","Went in for lunch and it was great!! Cute small place. Excellent and friendly service and the food was great. The falafel burrito was well made. Loved the consistency of the falafel and the way the burrito was grilled. It came with fries too which was a nice surprise. Definitely worth the price. Will go again and try the panini next time."
"5.0","amazing patio!! under colorful umbrellas!! delicious food, great coffe, friendly service! nothing to say more !! everybody should try there !! i will back definitely!"
"4.0","The food is good and the service is better. But the best way to enjoy this place is if someone else is paying!:)) I have to admit the reviews I was reading let me know I was not going to be disappointed and everything everyone said good about the place was correct. The drinks are done well and the steaks are very well done. The lobster bisque is less soup and more gravy, but it was good!!  A good place for a classy dinner, but save it for when someone tells you they want to take you out to dinner."
"5.0","This place never fails me. The service is good, the food delicious and the portions generous. Wish they delivered!"
"5.0","The gem of Southside! Food truck experience inside a tiny restaurant. The menu and ingredients are very simple, but everything is so good. My favorites are the chicken taco and their salsa. This is my new go-to lunch break spot. The service is super quick."
"4.0","I enjoyed an avocado toast here for breakfast. At first, I was worried that it might not be filling enough or too plain, but my worries quickly went away upon the first bite. There was a generous amount of avocado slices on 4 slices of rosemary ciabatta bread, topped with everything seasoning and a hint of lemon juice. I will definitely have to come back and try one of their signature sandwiches for lunch!"
"5.0","Delicious and fresh. One of the best burgers I have ever eaten! Definitely try this place."
"1.0","Well where do I start! The food was very bland for my taste. I'm not going to say much more but I won't be returning. I have to add this by far is one of the WORST Italian restaurants I've ever ate at. Good luck"
"5.0","Just went here last night for my first night in Pittsburgh and had a small wait, but it was definitely worth it! The area is upstairs and the space seemed a little small. We got sat down at the bar to eat and it was nice because I enjoyed watching the chefs make the food. We ordered a bunch of different dishes to share, which I recommend doing because there were so many options. My favorite thing was the pork skewers and the pork gyoza. The Gyoza was presently different than what I'm use to seeing, which was cool. My friend had recommended the Yaki Udon (pictures) because I've never tried any before and had amazing flavors. There was a DJ in the corner playing songs and the Japanese atmosphere was so chill. The white peach cider was a little too sweet but a good choice if you don't like beer."
"4.0","Food was great!  We had the quiche special, omelets and egg breakfasts. Server was nice and helpful. The only reason they did not get a 5 was because the lady who took our order was NOT friendly. We asked to add one more topping to the omelet (over the 3 limit) and her response was, 'no, we're too busy.'  How are you too busy to add one more topping to an omelet you're already making??  Her demeanor was not a good first impression of this restaurant."
"5.0","This place is amazing. Not only do they serve everything you could possibly want: breakfast, sandwiches, coffees, ice cream, bakery items, etc. at very reasonable prices. It is a great and usually pretty quiet place to study. Above all, the service is AMAZING. I have not yet been anywhere else that treats their customers so well! Every time I come in here they treat me the same way, no matter how busy they are. They offer samples of items that you are unsure of, provide refills on coffee (that is way less expensive than any other coffee shop - and yummier too!), they cater to your every need and are just adorably sweet. I love coming here to study and highly recommend it. Keep up the great job :)"
"4.0","My wife and I were meeting a friend from San Francisco for dinner and wanted a good place to eat near the Westin Hotel. We had walked by Sienna Mercato and Mezzo earlier in the day but hadn't paid much attention to either. However, since it was getting late and they are open until 10 am we decided to give Mezzo a try. It is located on the second level above Sienna Mercato. We were pleasantly surprised with the menu and the variety of options. There were so many good things on the menu we had trouble deciding what to try. As it turned out all of our dinners were wonderful. I had the La Genovese, a beef pasta dish, and an Arugula salad. My wife had Salmon Tartare and a spinach salad. We split an order of fried zucchini that was delicious. Also, the background music was nice. It was classic soft rock like the Beatles, the Beach Boys, etc. They have garage door windows on the front that were open, but were later closed when it started raining. The open windows allowed for a very nice soft breeze on this June evening. Also, the service was very good. We all thoroughly enjoyed the evening at Mezzo."
"1.0","So I can't say I'm an expert at Indian cuisine, but we decided to have the friday night buffet.  So we arrived at the restaurant at around 7:30pm, which we expected to be at it's busiest time of the week, and walked in to find one waitstaff, and two tables with patrons eating at them.  We approached the buffet to find a single table with about 8 hot entrees, all of them looking dry and unappealing.  I tried the chicken curry, the chicken tikka masala, and some rice.  The chicken was dry, and cubed and tasted like it was fresh out the can about four hours under a lamp.  The rice was so dried out, that it was almost hard.  The Chicken Biryani was so disgusting that I spit it out.  Our dirty plates sat on the table during the entire meal, not picked up by the waiter, who seemed too busy in the back to be tending to his tables.Upset and displeased, we left our table after ten minutes sitting there, and stood at the counter, because he never came out to give us a check.  After a few minutes, he noticed us standing there to pay and came to the counter, then bombarded by everyone else in the restaurant to pay while the waiter was out and paying attention to his patrons.  I can assure you that I'm no indian food expert, but I also know that's not how to run a restaurant.  It's no surprise that the restaurant was dead at prime time on a friday night in the middle of a college town.  I can promise you, I will never spend another dollar in that restaurant again.  Gordon Ramsay would have went apeshit."
"5.0","Everything is good here. Its usually moderately busy. The lamb chops are the best. I'm not happy that the grape leaves are from a can but oh well. The little grocery store is nice too!"
"4.0","4.5 stars!  I have to freak out about a place to give 5 stars and Azorean Cafe was close.  Ordered the American breakfast with presunto, which was similar to Canadian bacon in terms of texture but it is cured and sourced from Portugal.  The home fries were light with a hint of red pepper and parsley.  The portions were moderate. Not stuffed, not hungry, perfect for a hot summer day.  The owner came by our table and could not have been nicer.  This will be a regular spot!"
"5.0","This place is phenomenal! My uncle and I stopped by while walking around the strip for a quick lunch, and it was all so delicious! My uncle got the prosciutto sandwich and he couldn't stop talking about how amazing the bread and pesto were with all of the meats. I got the chicken caesar salad, and honestly, one of the better salads I've had. The portions are generous and the dressing tasted house made and it was SO good and garlicy which is how I like it. Definitely go if you want something quick yet absolutely delicious!"
"4.0","I came here for my friends birthday dinner & I was thoroughly impressed! We started off with the fried Brussels sprouts with goat cheese & they were to die for. The Brussels sprouts were Cooked perfectly & paired very nicely with the goat cheese. We didn't leave any behind! I split the Bacon & Mushroom  pizza with a friend & it was delicious! We got the pizza with no mushroom but added sausage & arugula. The toppings paired perfectly all together. They used sauce cans for the pizza tray and I thought that was very clever and a tasteful spin on a tray! I gave 4 stars only because the menu was pretty small, I would've liked to see more options! Other than that it was amazing!"
"2.0","Stay away unless you want a side of REALLY LOUD BASS with your meal.I barely noticed the food. I got a salad. Not bad. Medium heat chicken. It wasn't that spicy. If I go back, I'll get the next one up. But I probably won't go back. CHiKN is the loudest, bassiest restaurant I have ever been to. I couldn't wait to leave."
"3.0","I had an 8:15 reservation and was told they were 'running behind' and it might be an extra 15 minutes. Those 15 minutes turned into 45 and we weren't seated until 9, which was well past our reservation. Beyond that, the hostess was incredibly rude when I asked after half an hour how much longer the wait would be. When we were finally seated, however, the service was quick and good. Our waitress Jade was very good. The main entrees were only ok, there was nothing special about them. The true gems were the shareable sides, particularly the lobster mac and cheese. Overall, the experience was only ok and the food was uninspired. Would not go again."
"2.0","Cool venue I was really looking forward to going to. I travelled from Virginia and recommend to my friends as they had a great happy hour. When we arrived the menu was printed with the happy hour menu and times and then we get told 'they are not doing happy hour that day, we've been open since 2' I really had no idea what that meant but it was extremely disappointing as we got there exactly at 4 to partake in it. This place has a lot of potential as Emporio downstairs has great service and delicious food."
"3.0","When I first moved to Shadyside this was my weekend go to spot.  The pancake/crepes are the size of flying saucers and the hash browns are top notch (starchy crunchy goodness).  The lines are long but move fast.  That being said, I find it highly over rated and have since seen the light with regards to other brunch contenders in the area."
"4.0","Food was yummy, but a bit overpriced, especially the drinks. $6.50 for a grilled cheese from the kids menu with only chips, ouch! People were great and it's always cool getting out out in the Burgh."
"4.0","Sammy's is a place with lots of tradition. This is their original location. They know how to make a classic Corned Beef Sandwich and they make it well. They pile their sandwiches high, and they are made to order. All the ingredients are fresh. Service is fast and courteous. You order in the back, then pickup at the cashier. I've been eating hear for more than 20 years, this place is dependably good."
"1.0","At best very average. Duck tasted as if had been drenched in soy , horribly salty and far over cooked. Scallop risotto was a bland mush concoction with diced pieces of scallops. The person served this ate about 10% of the plate . Crab cakes were thought ok. Appetizers were a bit better . Cheesecake was shared by 4 people and 2/3 wasn't eaten. Service was nice  and prices were reasonable . Overall no one in our party enjoyed the place and can't recommend it."
"2.0","What a let down!The interior of the restaurant looks dingy and our service was good but our waitress was bizarre.  I had friends meet me there after being stood up.  Didn't really like being asked about it.  I don't think she was rude or anything but she was clearly just a kooky kind of girl who make sure everyone in the dining room knew she was great friends with her co worker Ed. So I guess it's good that the staff gets along!The bean dip was excellent but the strip steaks were pure gristle, order the crab cakes.I don't think I'll be coming back here but this place seems popular and everyone I know loves the food so I can only assume I was there on an off night."
"5.0","As usual, another great experience.  The special of the night was a tomahawk veal chop.  Outstanding!  Since a special occasion, added the lobster tail.  Again-outstanding.  $100 for this combination, but it was a birthday celebration so we celebrated.  Only disappointment was the valet parking which previously was complimentary is now $8.  Not sure if that was all for the employee parking the car so I handed her a $10 and said thank you.  Management might want to rethink this decision.  We spent over $325 for my wife and I.  Not too much to expect free parking!"
"4.0","After living in Pittsburgh for five years, I finally woke up on Saturday morning and decided that it was time to try Pamela's! The hubby and I headed down to Shadyside and got on the waiting list after 10:30. It took less than a half hour to get our table in the crowded and (very) noisy diner. Service was prompt, and we ordered enough food for four people! I really enjoyed my Chocolate Chip Banana Hotcakes. The light and crispy hotcakes were wrapped around little chocolate chips, banana slices, and whipped cream. So tasty! My side of turkey sausage and scrambled eggs were descent diner fare but nothing above average.Overall, I had a nice experience at Pamela's and would rate the food/establishment 3 1/2 stars. However, there are other breakfast/brunch competition in Pittsburgh that will continue to get my business over Pamela's."
"5.0","We came here with a group of 6 for dinner and sat at a fun sunken table in the back room. The restaurant looked really small but I may not have seen the entire place. The I had a sashimi bowl and the fish was delicious! I've been having trouble finding good sushi back in Pittsburgh but this place certainly hit the spot!!"
"2.0","To each their own but I wasn't crazy about the cheesesteak. Fries were good, though.  But maybe hot dogs are better."
"4.0","Seafood is my favorite and I wasn't disappointed at Wholey's Restaurant! The service was good and the food was good, too. The Catfish Nuggets!!!! They were delightful, succulent tasty bites of DELICOUSNESS paired with a sweet Thai sauce that elevated the already tasty bites. The Lobster Bisque was creamy, and thick!!! With just the right amount of seasoning and wonderful Creme Fraiche on top. The Stuffed Maine Lobster was different and although I enjoyed some of it I was a little put off by the stuffing on top. I didn't really taste the Jumbo and Lump shrimp mixed in with Asiago Cream sauce (?). The Lobster fries were good and the Blackened King Salmon!...... Deliciousness!!!!!!! The Bourbon Glaze made that Salmon worthy of a place on their menu for sure!!!! I almost stole my husband's dinner!To end our night on a sweetheart note, we had the oh so sweet Blood Orange Cheesecake and the Up All Night chocolate cake. Both were really tantalizingly good!!!! This Philly Foodie will make it back to try more good eats from Luke Wholey's!"
"5.0","After an afternoon of shopping in the Strip we stopped here for dinner and loved everything. Food was fantastic and the service couldn't have been better. Definitely coming back next time we're in town"
"5.0","Totally impressed by this place. The service was fantastic. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. We got here and it seemed pretty busy. Was totally surprised by how quickly our appetizers and entrees came out. Started with the lobster bisque fries which were pretty good, it was a big portion. The sushi someone else ordered looked great too. I had the crab stuffed salmon. The glaze on the salmon was excellent as was the kale. The potatoes were good too though a little soggy. Prices of things are reasonable, maybe a little high. Overall, really liked this place and will definitely be back."
"4.0","Doce Taqueria has been a great addition to the Southside. You can never have enough great taco places in the area! I personally prefer La Palapa, but this isn't far behind. If you're in the mood for a quick, authentic Mexican experience, Doce will hit the spot!"
"3.0","I have to say I'm underwhelmed.It's s nice place don't get me wrong but it's more hype than anything. The drinks are pricey and the food is ok. It's not awful but it's just nothing to write home about.It's packed with millennials in a cramped space. The floor plan is well laid out considering the small space. I'll probably give it another shot but if I do I won't rush out to do so."
"5.0","I love this place!! Great food, great selection of brews, and the most awesome staff. I can't wait to come back to Pittsburg so I can hang out here again!! Thank you Becky for being a great bartender!!"

If you're an adventurous foodie, go hereIf you're hip, not hip, business, go hereThe service, atmosphere, decor are all pretty awesome But the food is some of the best Japanese fare I've had.So JustGo HereNow"
"5.0","I walked in this cafe today, and ordered ille de omelet and espresso, it was so good, melted bri cheese wt side salad and all fresh ingredients like I never had such a tasty omelet before, servers are so friendly. They have a cute patio with colourful umbrellas, I'm so glad finally I got a chance to see this, definitely coming back"
"1.0","Pure garbage.  Being a Pittsburgh resident all of my life, I have been dragged here many times by people that don't understand how terrible this place is.The service usually is sub-par and that is only topped by the lack of quality food.  It's bland, you could do better at home style cooking.  The salad bar lacks true options, and for this type of food why not just go to Denny's where you're getting somewhat better food at a better price.People that like this place are usually collecting social security checks and trying to get home and in bed before the 5 O'clock news starts."
"1.0","Worst experience ever. The pizza delivery took 1 hour and change, got wrong size pizza, breadsticks were horrible, no grated parmesan, no garlic sauce. Called store to complain and they did nothing. Actually returned pizza to shop and they said they would give us $12 credit. Called back later and found out that it was a $7 'food credit' and no one remembered that it was supposed to be $12. Owner was rude and claimed that we were lying about our experience and said that if we didn't like it, we could take him to the local magistrate. Won't order from them again ever."
"4.0","I've been here several times, mostly for dinner and once for Sun. brunch buffet.  My most recent visit was in Mar. on a weeknight.During my most recent visit, my dining companion and I ordered the dosas.  They were much larger than expected, and quite filling, if a bit on the bland side.  We also ordered the vegetable naan, which I wasn't so much a fan of (I don't like crunchiness in my naan), but I've had other naans here and they've been good, so I think this is a personal preference.  Whenever I visit an Indian restaurant, I always order a mango lassi, so I did so here, and it was a nice accompaniment to my meal.On my most recent visit, I ordered the chicken tandoori as my entree, and it was quite pleasing.  I particularly liked how the chicken was brought to my table sizzling--clearly, fresh out of the tandoor oven.  I found it to be well-seasoned and delectable, with a beautiful red coating.  I like some heat to my food but not too much, so I usually order a spice level of 4/10.  On previous trips, I've ordered the chicken tikka masala and saag paneer, both of which were good, though I don't remember as much about them.  My favorite dish, however, is the chicken makhani, which I've sampled from friends who've ordered it.  Next time I go, I'll have to order it as my entree!I don't remember as much about the buffet, except for that the food was decent, albeit not as good as the a la carte dinner entrees I've had.  However, there was a lot more of it, so I was able to sample some foods I wouldn't have otherwise tried.  If you go to the brunch, you certainly won't leave hungry!Service has always been decent.  The atmosphere is particularly cozy and romantic, given that it's located in a converted Victorian house.  It's a great date spot!"
"5.0","Not much to say about this place other than they provide delicious, authentic Thai food and at a portion that can last over three meals! Service was fast, dinner was cheap. I don't look twice at other Thai restaurants in PGH"
"4.0","Good quality of food everything was fresh and didn't take to long customer service excellent. This is not Chinese fast food and has some good selections"
"4.0","As I climbed the stairs to the third floor, I feel like I was be transported to a very unique experience.  The decor is Asian and rustic. It has a verysexy vibe.  We sat at the sushi bar as we had not made a reservation.  We got to watch what was going on in the sushi bar and kitchen. This pace is no joke.  There was clearly a high level of attention being paid to everything that went out of ther kitchen. We got one of their sashimi bowls to share and their fish special.  This place seemed so authentic I was afraid to ask for American utensils but did not want miss out on the amazing roasted veggies on the fish dish. So fresh and flavorful. It was amazing. The presentation of the sashimi was on point. We enjoyed everything we ate. We also got an alcoholic and tea drink. Their drink menu is as unique and transformative as the rest of our experience.  Its pricey so don't come super thirsty but I recommend not skipping it.  Service was friendly and adequate- not a stand out in the experience.   No doubt, we'll be back"
"5.0","I eat lunch here at least once a week, I am never disappointed with the food quality, the portions or the price. One of my favorite places to eat. Staff is always polite and friendly. Highly recommend."
"5.0","My favorite cocktail bar in the city backed by outstanding bartenders.  Their drink menu is deep with highly custom drinks along with expertly prepared classics such as the Manhattan. Visiting on a warm spring, fall or summer evening is perfect when they have the windows up and you can catch a view of the city.  Service is good and prices are also reasonable."
"5.0","Consistently great food. Pabellon and rumbera arepas are both delicious! After the name changed, new staff members have been great at service!"
"4.0","I finally tested Peppi's out last week in the Strip District on a Saturday afternoon.  Living in Squirrel Hill and going to school at CMU, I am a die-hard fan of Uncle Sam's subs, and I go there quite frequently.  I'm surprised that no one has compared Peppi's and Uncle Sam's because they are practically identical, minus Uncle Sam's throwing in free fries if you eat in.I ordered a cheesesteak ($7.22 w tax), after all of the cashiers agreed that it was one of the best sandwiches on the menu.  As promised, it was a delicious sandwich.  The bread was nice and fresh and the steak was good.  Additionally, the people working there were very friendly as well.  The portion was huge, and I got a meal and a snack out of my sub.If you are looking for a quick sit-down or to-go lunch, Peppi's is a great place in the Strip for just that."
"3.0","I've had this place bookmarked and was wanting to go. I was super excited when my hubby told me that we had reservations there for Valentine's Day. We checked with the hostess and she seated us at a table for two. There were tables for two on each side of us. The table at the window was empty. Our first mistake was not asking to be moved there. It was empty the whole time we were there. Instead we had couples on both sides of and it felt like we were a table of 6. No privacy. No romance. We had high hopes for the food which was the second mistake. We ordered a breadbasket and a bowl of olives. The bread basket had several different types of bread. It came with a small container of honey and a small container of peppers and onions. The types of bread were explained to us which was nice. My husband enjoyed the peppers and onions mixture. I was having butter. It was a great consistency but was sweet. I wasn't expecting sweet butter. The bowl of green olives (with pits) had olive oil, lemon, and oregano. They were definitely one of my top two foods I had for dinner. They give you a small dish to put your pits in. It was a nice touch. For dinner we both went with the specials. My hubby ordered the pork w/mashed potatoes and I ordered the filet and shrimp which came with potatoes and green beans. I tried my husbands pork and his mashed potatoes. The pork was good but a smidge underdone. His mashed potatoes were creamy and smooth. The gravy was nice also. It was dark and rich and the right consistency. My potatoes were a tall stack of thinly sliced potatoes. It was cubed. I divided the tall stack into 3 small stacks. The stack that had been the bottom had potatoes that were almost raw. The next stack I tried was the middle and the potatoes were cooked a little but still close to raw. There was no seasoning on them. No salt, pepper, or anything. So basically a stack of raw(ish) and tasteless potatoes. The green beans were cooked correctly but the ends had been left on. I've never eaten somewhere that didn't break or chop off the ends. My second favorite food was the shrimp. I think they had been butter poached but I'm not sure. They were a nice size and consistency. The filet was ok. I thought there was a bit too much char on it and it didn't have much taste. I was super disappointed. For dessert we also went off the menu and I ordered the hazelnut chocolate dessert. It was pretty to look at-a small chocolate done with a swirl of caramel on the plate. It had chopped hazelnuts sprinkled on top. When you opened the dome there was a mousse inside that was more like ice cream than mousse. Doesn't that sound delightful???  It was not. I don't know how you can put chocolate, hazelnuts and caramel together and have it come out bland but it was. I even had my husband try it. The 3rd and biggest mistake I think we made was ordering the specials instead of off the menu. IF I were to go back it would be to try a few menu items. That's a big IF. The best thing about our dinner was our waiter. He did a great job and it's because of him that I'm giving the 3rd star. Otherwise there would only be two."
"4.0","I have been coming to Alexander's  off and on for almost 25 years. I think in all that time I have only had one meal that was below par. Pretty good average I'd say. I went the other night with my adult daughter. I had the calamari with pasta, a cocktail ( yum, yum), and a garden salad. The salad was very fresh and arrived promptly. The cocktail was strong but great. The calamari arrived quickly and was piled so high on the plate I could barely see over the plate! It was served on what tasted like fresh tomatoes over the pasta. It was so good I couldn't stop eating it, even after I was full. My daughter had the salad too with linguini and clam sauce. It was loaded with clams. They were tasty and not rubbery. She suspected they were canned but since they were tender it was okay. The sauce was fragrant too, not fishy. Our server was super efficient and polite. She kept up with us without being intrusive. The decor of the restaurant has been updated a bit over time. It's cute. A bit too bright for an Italian restaurant if you ask me, but I'm from New England where Italian places are all dimly lit. Overall, a wonderful, easy going, friendly  neighborhood place to go to relax over some good food and drink. Have a few laughs without a tv interrupting your dinner conversation. You have to sit in the bar for that. Take your mom. Take the family. Take your husband when you can't stand another night of cooking. Just go it alone and who cares about anyone else?! Just have fun eating some really good food that tastes like someone cares."
"4.0","A great place for Chinese food in Pittsburgh. Be prepared to spend a little extra but get your money's worth. Dinner portions are huge, flavours are great and they even have a small parking lot."
"4.0","Great pizza for the price.  Unfortunately it's close to SQ Hill, so it doesn't get as much love as it should, but for delivery it's awesome, and like half the price."
"4.0","Purchased the sirloin steak meal. 8oz steak with garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli for $19. Delicious meal for a very decent price."
"4.0","Great place for tacos on the go! One of the best tacos I've ever had. Unfortunately I was warned before eating here about the rude staff... They were right. The food was as good as the staff was rude. Very rude for no reason! 'Excuse me, DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT YET!?' - I'm sorry but I've never been here before and was reading the menu. Ps- there were only two people behind us"
"5.0","Located downtown, this corner bar is a great option for a quick lunch or dinner bite, and or beer. If you are going for a bite, when you walk in, you will head toward to back of the bar, where you will see the above head ordering signs and sandwich counter. You order the sandwich and pay there. While waiting for your most amazing sandwich, you can now order a drink at the bar (paying there). For those of you that have been here before, you know the run down. However, i was a little confused when i first patroned. The sandwiches are very very good. The woman that has made my sandwiches, every time i go, is down to earth and pretty patient with me (Thank god)! And the bar tenders are nice as well.  It's a very low key bar and not intimidating. I've eaten there alone and didn't feel weird about it. I have been coming here for the last few months, every few weeks, just to get my sammie fix. They are really that good!"
"4.0","Good service and good food. Went in for Taco Tuesday.  Highly suggest the pork tacos.  Will be back to try other items."
"4.0","It was an Eat 'N Park weekend. As a 24/7 chain, it's as sturdy as a walking stick and more affordable than X-Mas decorations in March. Kudos go out to our server Hudson. I predict (guess?) that he'll become a famous author someday based solely (superficially?) on his first name. Hopefully, his last name isn't Hawk. That would be tragic. For some reason this E 'N P's lemonade was different from the lemonade I had at the one in Monaca the night before. This lemonade had pulp in it. Hmmmm...The Buffalo Chicken Wrap (I got mine with Ranch dressing) is a rather spiffy sandwich. It's tangy of course, due not only to the sauce but also the cheddar. The chicken is thankfully tender. What else to say about it? Oh yeah, there's lettuce and tomato too. Who didn't know that? Apple pie a la mode; dependable as a Ford pick-up truck, and Eat 'N Park does it more than capably. No wonder people take home whole pies. When nothing else is open, Eat 'N Park is there for ya, and usually the food ain't bad. P.S. I am shocked that this Eat 'N Park remained UnYelped until now!"
"5.0","This is absolutely my favorite brunch place in Pittsburgh. I needed to make last minute brunch reservations for a group of 8. Every other place I called, seemed rude and annoyed, but the person on the phone at Caffe Mona was so nice and accommodating and allowed us to make a last minute reservation. The service was absolutely impeccable. We sat down and were served drinks right away. When we noticed the beautiful outdoor space with a roof made of colorful umbrellas, we asked if there was any way we could move outside. Again, they accommodated us and were so nice. The menu has such a good combination of savory and sweet items like crepes, french toast, and omelettes and everything was extremely reasonably priced. I had the mocha french toast and it was to die for. They also have a great selection of teas, coffees and lattes. I cannot speak highly enough about the atmosphere, service, and food at this restaurant."
"4.0","A very popular weekend brunch place, with good reason.  The specialty pancakes are incredible, even if mine had so much brown sugar in it that I could literally feel the grains against my teeth.  That isn't a knock or praise, that's just how it is.  If that sounds good to you, you will love Pamela's...if that grosses you out, there's a GNC across the street, go make a protein shake.  They turn tables fast for a place this busy, and you get a lot of food for your hard earned cash (they only take cash, so hit up the PNC bank on the corner while you wait 20 minutes for a table).The service is pretty quick since the wait staff doesn't seem to strictly ascribe to seating sections or table divisions the way the British and French carved up the Middle East (and look at all the problems THAT caused).  They also bring you your check with the food and get you off the table fast by making you pay up front.  I have no problems with any of this, Pennsylvanians are known in my home state for their efficiency and lack of skills operating watercraft.  Every decent U.S. City has a place like Pamela's, even some not-so-decent ones (that's right, I'm talking to you, Montgomery, and you, Little Rock).  Pittsburgh's specialty is the crepe like 'hotcakes'.  They are delicious, with lots of brown sugar (see above), and a faintly salty flavor along with a crispiness on the edges.  I tore that shit apart."
"4.0","A good mixed crowd age wise which is nice- mostly people who like good food and want a nice dinner out- not too fancy but nice enough. The free bean dip/bread is a nice unique offering. The garden side salad was yummy and different than what you'd typically get. The quinoa puff appetizer was good but nothing compared to the ginormous pork chop on top of goat cheese chive whipped potatoes I got- deliciously prepared. My hubby got the crab cakes and risotto which was equally as amazing. We really were impressed with this place- I think it is totally flying under the radar for how solid it is. We will definitely be back but hope the menu changes up every once in awhile as there aren't a whole lot of options. My one suggestion- educate your servers about gluten allergies- it's a pretty common question, especially in fine dinging and my server had absolutely no idea what gluten even was."
"4.0","Went back for the first time since opening week five years ago. Really don't know why we waited so long!  The food was excellent, the portion sizes just right and the service was great. If I have one complaint, it would be the house salad...nothing to write home about. It was very crowded on a Friday night but the service didn't miss a beat."
"5.0","Ate at the CG for the first time during Restaurant Week while dropping our son off at PittIn short, it was amazing!  Coupled with Restaurant Week it was great value. Food was delicious from the starters through to the desserts. Best selection of fresh baked breads. Steaks prepared perfectly. Mashed potatoes addictive.  Green beans even a veggie hater could appreciate. Our server Kelley's attention to detail was spot on and the staff that supported her were always timely and smilingGreat overall experience."
"1.0","Their seafood calzone clearly uses imitation crab meat and REALLY low quality shrimp. It has a really bad fishy taste and is honestly inedible. I'm incredibly disappointed and wish I could have my money back."
"4.0","Had my sister's birthday dinner here.  We order 5 dishes and ate with rice. I thought the dishes were good and the portions were pretty good size.  I can't remember the dishes that we got but the chow fun, Mongolian beef, dumplings, and chicken fingers(sweet and sour chicken with the sauce on the side apparently) were really good.  The dining area was clean, nicely decorated and lighted.  The only thing I didn't enjoy was walking into the dining area and have tables full of white families staring at you like they never seen an Asian person before.I would definitely give this place another try."
"5.0","We always stop here when we pass through Pittsburgh. Today, our server, George, was wonderful!  The patio has beautiful views of the river and a great atmosphere.  We had the sesame chicken salad and apple gorgonzola salad.  Both delicious choices for a summer afternoon lunch.  We can never pass up the boneless buffalo wings and they get better every time we visit!"
"4.0","Our late Friday arrival in Pittsburgh, left us without any food plans, so we chose this stack of three eateries because it was walkable from our hotel, and it looked as though other food options were close by. We followed the path of least resistance and landed in Mezzo, because we were able to find a couple of bar seats, despite a considerable crowd. The happenstance was serendipity! Our charcuterie plate was spot on, offering an array of meats, ranging from buttery fat prosciutto, to a fiery sopressata. The pate was mineral-ly goodness, and a chutney that provided a delicious, acidic offset, was good. Our bread assortment featured an interesting sweet lard spread, and when we ordered a bowl of green olives, our bartender suggested a wine that made the olives even more enjoyable. We also opted for the local cheeses, finding a bleu cheese that we liked so well, we sought it out the next day while visiting the strip. The atmosphere was warm, and inviting, inspiring chat with others at the bar, which we enjoyed. For an unplanned stab at our first dining experience ever, in Pittsburgh, Mezzo set the tone for a great weekend in the city. If you like to chill, and graze, it's a great choice!"
"5.0","I love this place!  Everything that I have had is wonderful.  I had a Mario Hoagie and a cannoli during the Bloomfield Italy days.  Delicious, delicious.  The hoagie was huge.  Everyone in the store is like family.  This is a must stop for anyone visiting Pittsburgh. I have attended dinners and lunches and cooking classes at the store.  Each is special.  Each is terrific."
"5.0","Excellent food. Halibut to die for. Shrimp volcano excellent. Lobster fondue- could eat it every single day."
"5.0","Such a great spot for cocktails, especially during happy hour! The bartenders are phenomenal and very friendly. I'm a sucker for a good Moscow mule, and the Summit's did not disappoint. They are on tap, but don't let that stray you away; they are truly top notch. They have a pretty decent draft list, and any cocktail I've tried has been great. As far as food goes, they have some interesting options. I've never actually had a full meal here, but their small plates have always been pretty great. Their spinach and feta dip is not to be missed, and the popcorn is a quick and fun bar snack (especially the roasted garlic and herb popcorn)."
"5.0","I love a place that serves breakfast all day.  This diner is cash only, but the food is great and portions are huge.  I had an omelet and my friend had pancakes and we were both very happy and very full!"
"4.0","Cheap and filling. What more do you need? I had an omelette and it was HUGE! Also served with potatoes and endless coffee. Definitely stop here is you are looking for a fulfilling breakfast on the cheap."
"3.0","Come here infrequently due to the high prices for mediocre food. A small cup of soup is $5.13. I find that overpriced for something that is frozen, but it satisfies the soup craving when stuck in the library. However, in November through my Panera rewards I had a free bagel everyday of the month. I will say their bagel quality is pretty good. They are huge and filling. I tried a variety from cinnamon crunch, pumpkin pie, asiago, blueberry, and everything, but my favorite is always sesame. Their plain cream cheese is also really creamy and delicious, but more expensive than the bagel. Their online ordering is great if you know when you will be popping in. Otherwise, there is usually a line."
"5.0","I love it here! They are so nice. This is the first place I have been where it feels like I'm right back in Texas because they are so kind and helpful and personable. The food is yummy like a home cooked breakfast;) will be back over and over again!!!"
"5.0","This is an excellent burger place in Pittsburgh! The beef is really flavorful. The different burgers have some unique toppings that all meld really well together. The fries taste homemade and are also very crispy which I love. My favorites are the Maggie's Farm and Shadyside. Also have never had to wait long to be seated, which is rare for Lawrenceville, especially given how great the food is."
"4.0","I love Tamarind! Aside from food itself, I love two things about them: 1) They don't have a TV in their restaurant. I never understood why Indian restaurants feel the need to play music videos on a TV while people want to spend time being together and looking at each other's face and NOT A TV. If you want to watch a TV while having food, you order take out! Isn't that obvious?? So, it gives you a good dining out vibe that most Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh do not. 2) I love the dining area. It is bright and it feels spacious enough. Again, most of the Indian buffets in Pittsburgh have dark dining rooms with small windows and little light. And the food: Always consistent and tasty. I love all their vegetarian items. I just feel like their chicken tikka masala could have a more solid sauce, it is too watery for my liking and compared to what I have seen in other Indian restaurant. Otherwise, will definitely return while still in Pittsburgh!"
"4.0","This is great pizza when you need a quick fix. I love that you can customize it as much as you'd like. It always comes out crispy, the ingredients are fresh, and I've never had to wait long. I do have one complaint though. The last time I visited, there was a young man who had told me it was his second week working there. He was a nice kid and was doing his best to keep up and help out his coworkers. The coworkers were incredibly rude, disrespectful and verbally abusive toward him. They spoke and behaved this way in front of me and 2 other customers. In hindsight, I should have spoken up for him. I was just stunned that they could be so outrageously awful toward a trainee. I hope they look for other jobs if they're so miserable, or I hope the young man gets out and finds some place to work where the people won't treat him like dirt."
"5.0","Great service! Great food! Great prices! And he has a PRIME LOCATION with all of the renovations and new businesses moving into the redevelopment on Terminal Way! House salad with crispy chicken was fabulous! I heard the Reuben is to die for, so that's my next! Love little locally owned spots!"
"5.0","George was probably one of the top ten waiters we have had in our 64 years of life. We went to  Jerome Bettis Grill 36 after a Heinz Field stadium tour. We were pleased with the great wings and salad and the very attentive attention George gave to our two grandsons age 6 and 9, on their very first visit to Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh was our home town for 40 years and we  wanted to share with our grandsons our home town and  the Steeler Nation.George and Jerome Bettis grill 36 only added to a perfect Steeler win and a wonderful weekend in Pittsburgh. Did I mention good food and a TV replay of the Steeler /Panther game which made for a wonderful dining experience.JLuttnerNew Bern,NC"
"4.0","Nice spot for happy hour and meeting friends!  The cocktails are always a good choice (I especially liked the Penicillin drink!)  As for food, I've tried the Roasted Garlic/Herb popcorn which is a great snack when you just want something to munch on while you drink. The Black Bean Hummus, Smoked Gouda Mac and Cheese, and Salads are all good too.... every time I go the Menu Specials are different and unique.  I always take guests to this restaurant when they visit Pittsburgh; we ride the Incline up and enjoy the views of the city from Shiloh Street.  Also, there are board games that you can pick and choose from to play while you drink and eat!"
"5.0","Thai Gourmet has been my go-to Thai restaurant for years. In my opinion, it's the best Thai food in Pittsburgh. Everything is super spicy (which I love), authentic, fresh, and scrumptious. The servers at Thai Gourmet are really nice and  the food comes out quickly. The inside of the restaurant has lots of traditional Thai decor and succulents. It is a little small inside, but they have worked around that by remodeling the interior. We started off our dinner with the summer rolls. You get your choice of tofu, chicken, or shrimp. My sister is vegetarian so we opted for tofu. They have lots of vegetarian/vegan options here. The summer rolls were amazing! The vegetables inside were crisp and the peanut dipping sauce paired nicely with the rolls. For my main course, I opted for the Pad Kee Mao with shrimp. You get to pick your level of spice, so I opted for a 10. The spiciness does not disappoint here! The Pad Kee Mao was phenomenal. The noodles, the veggies, the shrimp, the spice, the portion- everything was perfect. My sister loved her Shrimp Pad Thai and said it was the best one she's ever had. If you want to try Pittsburgh's greatest Thai food, definitely come to Thai Gourmet. I have a great experience every time I come here."
"2.0","Food was cold at all stages of the meal. Dip Trio and pretzel dogs (recommended by the server) were obviously microwaved, and not microwaved well. Stuffed peppers were out of a can, undercooked, and cold in the center.Nice selection of draft beers. Server (very cheery!) told us to order appetizers before the end of the hockey game for a couple dollars off each, so we did!I gave the server a credit card at the end of the meal. She brought me the receipt to sign, but not an itemized...so I asked her for one.Sure enough, the appetizers weren't discounted. If she had brought me an itemized receipt and we'd noticed the mistake, I would have forgiven it, but the fact that she didn't AND there was the pricing difference made me feel like we were just getting ripped off, which is inexcusable."
"3.0","Eat'n Park is way different from when I was growing up. The food is OKAY. The staff was just there, nothing special, no smiles. The service was slow. This just wasn't a great experience and it's sad because I was looking forward to it as there are no eat'n parks around my residence. I could go the rest of my life without going back although the cookies are still delicious and soft."
"4.0","If it's summer time you must try Il Tetto at least once. It is a little pricey which is my only complaint but I just love it here. On a nice summer night it is just stunning with the lights and looking at the buildings in the city. One of my newest discoveries about this place is the Tiki Nights every Sunday starting in the Spring. They offer island themed drinks and food. All of the drinks come in super cute glasses. And if it gets too pricey you can always just head down to Emporio and enjoy some meatballs!"
"5.0","I am VERY impressed with the new 'drive thru' here at Eat N Park. I ordered a Whale of a fish sandwich from the car on the way home tonight.Not only was it ready by the time I got there , it was still piping hot and they even gave me a free cookie!The girl at the window was very energetic and friendly. Excellent Customer service.I love the Pittsburgh Fish tradition at all of the local churches , and I can hardly wait to them to begin the Lent specials. BUT I have to now include this Eat n park to my Friday fish stop. Thank you again to a local Pittsburgh company."
"4.0","I came here for a birthday celebration as my husband is a big fan of a food steak. We made reservations on open table and were seated right on time. When we arrived at the table, there was a happy birthday card in addition to birthday confetti on the table which was very thoughtful. We also received a complimentary champagne toast. Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable and made our dining experience very enjoyable. For appetizers we ordered the tuna tartare which was excellent. It was a bit spicy so be aware when ordering. It tasted very fresh and the mango sauce on the side was a nice balance. I ordered the sliced filet medium and my husband ordered the filet mignon medium rare. Both were excellent cooked to perfection. For sides we got the lobster Mac and cheese which came with large chunks of lobster. I enjoyed this dish but wish it was more creamy. At the end they came out with a birthday dessert which consisted of cheesecake and a coffee chocolate cake. Both of these were good but nothing amazing. Of note we did get charged $5 for this. I think this should be comped considering the $50 price tag on each steak. Overall I really enjoyed my experience at the capital grille. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very cozy and the service is excellent. It's a great place to celebrate a special occasion at!"
"5.0","We have returned many times and this has some of the best Indian food I have ever had! I am a huge fan of their Saag Paneer and Tikka Masala Paneer. Their breads are also very fresh and delicious. Their lunch buffet is always well stocked and food is constantly being monitored and refilled. I will continue to return!"
"4.0","This place is the bomb for lunch. They have a huge variety of options that only $7. The  lunch specials come with lemongrass or wonton soup and a spring roll. I recently had the green curry chicken with rice and the portions are huge! Even for lunch we all had left overs. I got a spice level of 5 and thought that was the right amount for a bit of heat but not too overpowering. The green curry was very flavorful and not too thick. My only complaint was the chicken was a little dry. I also am a fan of their thai spicy basil fried rice. Definitely recommend for lunch as you can't beat the price for the amount of food they give."
"5.0","THE BEST! Added a couple of pictures of the burrito. Man this is really it! Chipotle Grill eat your heart out. What these couple of folks do in a small stand on Penn Ave. is flat out amazing. Today is first I had the burrito, just like the best you can find in SoCal. Loaded with flavory goodness!I would go on, but about to reheat another one. Let the pictures do the talking. Oh, and when you reheat a burrito on flour tortilla, wrap in foil and either bake at low heat or wrap in foil and reheat on stovetop."
"5.0","If you're looking for an authentic Thai food experience, this is the place to go. The decor is not 'fancy' like some of the trendier Thai places, however the food is amazing. The ingredients are extremely fresh. The prices are very reasonable. Portions are generous. The service is very friendly. Parking is very easy, esp. in the evening.This restaurant is by far my favourite Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh."
"5.0","We live in Rochester, NY & came to Pittsburgh for the weekend and stumbled across this place. Absolutely amazing.. I've been thinking about it everyday since. Can't wait to go back! Amazing quality, great service and phenomenal breakfast foods."
"5.0","Really lovely spot. This restaurant is located on the second floor on the building with awesome garage door windows. very cool vibe with chalk lettering on the walls. We sat at the bar and the bartender was lovely. We got a few drinks which he was more than happy to give suggestions and allow us to taste wines before we made a decision. We then ordered the grilled shrimp which were DELICIOUS. It was four shrimp two on each skewer with a delicious combo so things on tip including olives. We really loved it. Then we got the charcuterie tray which is highly recommended. They do farm to table style and it changes all the time so it'll be different every time you go. The man who brought it out explained everything on it, and gave suggested pairings. It was amazing and so was the info! And finally we finished the meal by splitting the scallops. And oh my gosh you should get these. They have an amazing crispness which I loved with bacon and shashito peppers. We will be back! It was all delicious and everyone was super friendly."
"4.0","When I first walked in on a Friday night, an hour before they were closing, I was just surprised that my friend and I were the only ones here. It made me think twice about how fresh the fish can be if there is no turnover. We order the sushi sushi lover for two which seemed like the best deal since it came with miso soup and green tea as well as 28 pieces of sushi. It consisted of two 6 piece rolls (tuna + salmon) as well as 16 other sushi pieces (8 unique pieces, so 2 of each). The toro was great while the salmon in the salmon roll was a little tough for my liking. The fish came out in a nice cool temperature, not too cold and not too warm and the stickiness of the rice complemented it pretty well.For dessert, I saw that tempura ice cream (they bread a scoop of ice cream and fry it) was on the menu and I'm always a fan of fried ice cream so I gave it a try. It was definitely not worth the $7.50 price tag. I think you can do better elsewhere if you've never had fried ice cream before.Overall, I'd say this place is pretty expensive and not the best value you can find but considering it is in station square, that's how it is down there. Service was great, considering we were the only patrons in there for a good 20 minutes until thankfully another party of 2 came in so it wouldn't be awkward. I would give this place 3.5 stars but since I can't, I'll bump it up to 4 and call it self-justifying the quality of the restaurant due to the amount of money we had to fork out in the end for 2 people."
"5.0","Blueberry Ricotta Pancakes- the best pancakes that will ever go in your mouth! You won't be disappointed. I got the Guy Breakfast which is enough for two and my husband got a burger which was excellent! Will be back! The iced coffee is really really good coming from a coffee snob! I wish it was free refills but I'd pay for another."
"5.0","I've been here four times in the past week I've been in town for business. This review describes my experiences over the course of my visits. Three times were at the bar, and I had excellent service and food. I had the shaved brussel sprout salad, the French onion soup, a filet mignon, a bone in ribeye, an the salmon on my visits to the bar for dinner. I also bright my wife here when she visited me this past weekend. We sat in the main seating area and had a superb experience. She had a filet mignon, I had a bone in filet. I had my salad and soup for starters and the augratin potatoes and brussel sprouts for sides. We had ice cream for dessert, and it was really good. I highly recommend this place, as you have a very high probability of success for your experience."
"5.0","OMChikin! I don't even care that we were the oldest people in the joint. There's no age limit for hot chicken!Absolutely the best hot chicken in Pittsburgh. Hands down!The Stack'd folks certainly know what they're doing with this place.Shared a sandwich and fries with my boyfriend. We got medium heat which would be comparable to hot elsewhere.The chicken was juicy, tender and full of flavor. Slaw on the side instead of on sammy as that's how I prefer it.Pickles are crisp and tasty.Crinkle cut fries, my fave, cooked to perfection.Can't wait to go back. I'm in love!"
"1.0","The absolute worst dining experience of my life, the service was terrible from the start. After waiting several minutes with no one approaching to take our order, my husband assumed that we had to go to the coffee counter to order, only to be told that they will come to us to take our order. I ordered a side of bacon with a crepe, and my bacon was literally so black that it was inedible. After asking to have it removed from our check, and advising that I didn't want to have it re-made, we finished our meals. Upon receiving the check, I handed over my debit card only to find that it was rung up for a completely different total. When I asked why I was then told that they forgot to charge us for the water on the original check. I understand if they charge for water, but that should have been disclosed at some point prior to ringing my card for a completely different total than what I was advised when I handed over my card. On top of all of that, the food was mediocre at best. I will never spend money here ever again. All of that being said, I did tip the server 20% as I believe that service workers should be paid fairly, even when poor service is provided such as in this case."
"5.0","Amazing food.  CASH ONLY.  I always ALWAYS get the strawberry crepes and my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Perfect balance of sweet and savory, because it's filled with strawberries and like a cream cheese whipped cream and sprinkles of brown sugar...SO YUM.  Otherwise, basic coffee, sides of eggs, bacon, and sausage, etc.  But just go and get the crepes.  Just do it. I was going to give it 4 stars instead of 5 because there is ALWAYS a ridiculous wait during meal times.  You just have to expect that and set aside a whole morning or afternoon.  But I settled on 5 stars because, although it's a long wait to get a table, once you get one, the waiters are so fast and attentive, and my orders always come SUPER fast.  So in a way it kind of makes up for the wait.  [if you just hate waiting, you can also order for carry out; OH and another side-note, the crepes are EXCELLENT heated up in the oven later.  I'd usually eat half, take half home and eat the rest later]Anyway, whenever you're in Pittsburgh, go here!  I sure do."
"4.0","Great crepe and omelette. French toast was not decent but I won't be ordering it again. I'll definitely be back to try more crepes though! Tons of options and very good portions. It was a little warm inside though."
"4.0","Fernando's Cafe is an excellent place to stop in and have lunch or dinner if your looking for good pizza or hoagies.  It really doesn't look like much but in the inner city life they tend to be the best places to stop.  The pizza if a good fair price and tastes excellent.  Their sandwiches are plenty good and they are not cheap with their toppings. The daily deals are well worth stopping back for. The staff if really laid back and a good group of people.  If you're in town for a convention they are in full support of most of what cones to town."

"3.0","I have probably been here 30 times in the span of my life and I remember when this was the place to go for authentic Italian food. I wish I could say it's still the same. It's really hit or miss these days with an emphasis on miss. And that makes me really sad. My friends and I used to drive in from the suburbs in our early 20s for the amazing dishes they served. Now that I live a block away it's such a disappointment. It makes me wonder what's happening to Little Italy.No idea if or when I'll be back. #sosadaboutit"

"5.0","I've never been to a restaurant where I have received such great service!  The waitstaff was very knowledgeable about all of the different menu items. My glass was always full and staff was attentive but not overwhelming. We had the Lamb Pasta, the Italian cheese tray, and the sausage and Pepper appetizer.  The server explained all of the different cheese to us and pairings. The cheese were definitely not for us but it was still very interesting to try them all. The sausage and Pepper appetizer was delicious as was the lamb pasta. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone!"
"5.0","Lets talk TACOS kids.  No, I don't mean those crappy wanna be Taco Bell type tacos ... I mean real, honest to goodness, fresh off the grill tacos.  Beef, steak, and chicken .... with almost any topping you could conjure up in that taco fueled mind of yours. Fresh as the day is long ... what?  I already said fresh?  Well I guess it deserved a second mentioning then didn't it? Everything is fresh ... Everything is awesome.  Edgar makes the world a little better with his awesome food.  I work 1 block from this place and sometimes I walk by just for the smell, 98% of those times I don't even make it a block before turning around and indulging my addiction.  That's right boys and girls .... Addicting is a word you could associate with Edgar's food.  Do yourself a favor ...... Go grab some REAL tacos, burritos, and every other 'o's' you can find here.  The 'o' is for HOOOOOOLY Frijoles this place is wicked awesome!!"
"4.0","Second time being here. Ordered everyone's favorite blueberry pancake and 2 fried eggs over BBQ brisket for our first visit. This time, I wanted to try something different so I ordered a salmon platter and again the BBQ brisket (it is SOOOO GOOD!) the salmon platter would not recommend."
"5.0","This place was such a cute Italian bistro! Our waitress was quirky and cute (the one with the accent, I didn't catch her name) and really knowledgeable of the menu! Overall a great place for a quiet dinner for 2!"
"2.0","Food was great but amenities were poor, wouldn't come back. At the time of ordering our meal at the front desk we were informed there was no decaf coffee and we could leave the restaurant to purchase somewhere else and then a tip request came up at the point of payment prior to any form of service. So what and who did we tip $8, the mystery remains. We were told where to sit and there were no other options. Our number was there and that was it. There was no service that brought water with our meal. Instead we were directed to the self serve 'water bar' which we have no idea where the water is from on top of the fact they didn't even offer the option of purchasing bottled water. All in all an experience I would not repeat."
"4.0","My husband and I stopped by late one evening after having dinner down the road. We have had every intention of coming here but have never been in the area at the right time to take advantage of this brewery. Be prepared to park on the street (close or far depending on time of day) to Cinderlands (as with any business in Lawrenceville). We sat at the bar in front of the kitchen area where the chefs were whipping up burgers, sandwiches and fries. One of the chefs was 'playing' with a Korean styled mexican street corn dish that was to be put on the menu the following day. He explained the ingredients and flavors he was incorporating into the corn and performed several trials while we were there. This was really cool and unique to see as you do not often have access to view such a process in a restaurant much less interact with the chef! The setup of the brewery itself was very unique. It was long and narrow, with the bar on one side of the wall and a single line of booths against the other wall that extended into the back of the building. It appeared as if they occupied two business spaces based on the length of the place. What caught my eye, following an open kitchen concept, was the large, high wooden shelving behind the bar with the beer taps below. It was a very dark wood, a stark contrast from the rest of the building with two TV's located in front of it to catch the next sports game. Also, by the front door, there was a high counter that allowed customers to sit inside or outside without a window in between. There was one guest with a dog sitting outside while she socialized with a gentleman across from her seated inside.We were served quickly by a waitress who provided water for us while we looked over the menu. There were two sizes offered - a 5 oz option and a 'regular' size option. The waitress allowed us to sample before ordering our beverage. I ordered a regular Cherry Lime Sour beer that was the perfect blend of sour with a hint of cherry and lime. I thoroughly enjoyed it! I really enjoyed our experience here and would love to come back sometime soon. The food looked and smelled delicious, the beer was flavorful and true to its description, the prices were reasonable, and the employees were quick to serve and friendly."
"5.0","Oh Chinatown Inn, how I love the.  Let me count the ways: Open late, Clean, Friendly, well decorated, Excellent food, and.... (sigh!) just as excellent pricing!  I think that you'll be hard pressed to find a better combination for Chinese food anywhere in Pittsburgh.  I tried this place after hearing from several people that I HAD to go there.  It turns out that they were absolutely correct!  If you like Chinese cuisine, drag yourself into town and give this place a try.  Heck, even if you don't like Chinese food or are unsure if you do, give this place a try.  I liked it so much I am giving it 5 stars...  I recommend the Egg Rolls (Very fresh), General Tso's Chicken, and Chicken Fried Rice.  If you go here and don't love the place then you just don't like Chinese food... and I feel very sad for you.  ;-)"
"4.0","Lunch menu updated. Service better this visit. Early lunch, so it's calm. The egg roll is sub par but had since crispy shell. Seems like it's reheated in a microwave. Quite a wait for main course. But it was worth the wait. Large portion.Asparagus shrimp lunch, white rice. Good. Won ton soup, good but too salty. Will alter your order for taste"

"2.0","I stopped for some Halal food and decided to go with lamb curry over rice. In addition I was asked to choose a vegetable dish. I picked the spinach dish. Do not know the exact name.Lamb is my favorite meat, however, this place was able to cook it with no flavor in it. Honestly, I did not feel that I was eating lamb. However they cook it, it does not make any sense. It has some spices in it, but could not decide what they are. The hot spice is just hot, without adding any good flavor.The rice was plain and bland, not impressive at all.The spinach was obviously made from frozen spinach. Therefore you get no flavor of true spinach. For $9, they filled the box with rice and put about 5-6 pcs of 1-inch lamb cubes. The amount was more than enough for a person, but without any taste, it can feed at least 3 people.This place is lucky for not having a competition around them offering same type of food.I also checked their market and felt sorry for whoever shops there. Their prices are unfortunately flying. These people do not deserve to sell halal. But, they will continue to this until their customers teach them they are not treated in a halal way. They can easily sell for cheaper, but they won't. Casue money is good and delicious for the. That is why they will not care about the taste of food as long as customer continue to appreciate this type of poor quality."
"1.0","not be overdramatic but the hot chicken tenders gave me ulcer-level stomach pains. also, the fries tasted like cardboard and the coleslaw was dry and mediocre."

"5.0","Prior to a recent trip to Pittsburgh, my better half and I were watching some YouTube videos about top things to do while visiting.  Although I have been there countless times, I figured I might discover some new things as well and one of the things that caught our eyes was a video that suggested La Gourmandine!The video made a persuasive case and given that the pastry shop was less than five minutes from our hotel, we made a beeline there after dropping off our bags!Upon entering the shop, you'll see a drool worthy case full of sandwiches and savories, followed by another case full of pastries and sweets.  It was heavenly!  Service was so friendly, too and we even got a free little bite (can't recall what the guy said it was but I believe if you check in on Yelp it offers the same thing).My pain au chocolate was so flaky and the chocolate so delicious, I felt like I was in heaven while eating it.Definitely check out this place if you're downtown.  And based on what fellow Yelper Eileen S told me, there are a few locations in the surrounding area so look for them if you're anywhere near Pittsburgh!"
"5.0","This space is awesome. It's a hidden gem of you're looking for great music, awesome vibe, and the best spicy scallops roll in pgh. Great drink selection. Prices are fair. Will be my new spot when I crave sushi."
"3.0","Stopped in upon the recommendation of our hotel's front desk when we inquired about a family-friendly restaurant downtown.  While there was no official kids menu, there were quite a few kid-friendly options already on the menu (I.e chicken tenders, grilled cheese, burgers & fries, etc.). Redbeards is set up with a bar on the 1st & 2nd floors...and tables surrounding.  While I'm sure it wouldn't be appropriate to bring kids there after dinner hours, the staff made us feel completely welcome bringing our kids in for dinner before the hockey game.  Ordered some pretty basic lunch-type food (taco salad, flatbread sandwich, pretzel & chicken tender app, and a cheese-only hoagie).  The service was outstanding, and they were beyond friendly and welcoming.  The only catch was...when our bill came, that cheese-only hoagie they were so nice to make for one of our kids...they charged us $10 for that!  In fact...we only ordered soft drinks (no alcohol), and the items mentioned above...and our bill was $60!I guess that's the going rate for these downtown places...but for  lunch-type items...this still seemed a little steep.Aside from that...the food was great, the service outstanding, and it had a relaxed atmosphere.  I would definitely recommend...just be prepared...it's not an inexpensive place."
"4.0","Love this place! Been coming here for 4 years. I bring my parents, my friends, and my family friends here. Great food and tastes like home. Love that there are north and South Indian offerings.Recently, the service has become soooooooo slow. I can only come here if I know I have a couple hours to spare. It's so disappointing- even when I come when the restaurant isn't busy it takes forever to have my order taken and be served. Please fix this and make Tamarind great again!"
"4.0","Walked in off the street just curious as to what is inside. Everything looked awesome place smelled even better than awesome. Got a huge piece of baklava for five dollars.

"4.0","For Christmas every year my girlfriend is blessed by old Saint Nick with a slew of gift cards to local businesses usually near work or home. This year was exciting because we got $50 towards a visit at Luke Wholey's Grille. Obviously, we knew it would be different than the fish market, but curious to see how tasty things might be! We made our way down the Strip around lunch time so we were fairly hunger and ready to enjoy some free grub. Being that we had a gift card, it was a must to get an appetizer! Ball out a little, we thought! Decided on crab cakes, which were damn there perfect. The worst thing that can happen to a crab cake is too much oil, these were fried just right and there was fluffy crab meat all throughout. After that good treat, we were greeted by who I believe to be the owner, with our entrees. My GF got the Ahi tuna sandwich with a side of fries and I went with the Steel City lobster roll, also with a side of fries. We were both impressed with our meals! The amount of lobster that was on the roll was a pleasant surprise and my goodness how delicious and buttery it was. Me being me, I had to try a bite of my GF's tuna which was grilled nicely on the outside and just right in the middle. A great experience we had at Luke Wholey's and we do plan on returning sooner then later. Excited to try the dinner menu options and apps!"
"5.0","The service was great, they were super helpful. Not too busy during the morning rush, the French toast was amazing especially the strawberry stuff theput on top and my boyfriend got the breakfast croissant it comes with breakfast potatoes that are super yummy as well"
"2.0","Not a great experience.I really wanted to like this place. Instagram photos were amazing. I was so excited for a great burger. I was very underwhelmed. My burger was just so so.  It seemed to lack proper seasoning. I ordered cheese fries and they weren't really hot and were just covered in cheese goo. My wife got the pickle brined fried chicken sandwich and the breading just kinda fell off. The bill came to $16 for a burger and fries. I don't think I'll be back."
"5.0","Came in with some girlfriends for a night out. We shared some small dishes and enjoyed them all. Then most of us got the udon noodle bowl and we loved it. It was pretty spicy so be prepared. We made reservations in advance and were placed in a small room with two sunken tables. It was a cool atmosphere and we loved the whole experience."
"3.0","I wasn't expecting much (as I'd never heard of this place and randomly walked in today) but I didn't leave with much either.My dad and I both had very average-tasting hoagies for lunch. I had a chicken parmesan hoagie. It was quite overcooked and I still have the taste of burnt breading my mouth."
"1.0","I've been here a few times and the service here is poor at best. I understand having to wait on busier nights, however when I have a seat at the bar and they're serving EVERY person around me and my party, it's unacceptable. The drinks are good at best, the draft list isn't anything to write home about. If the service were acceptable this would be a 3.5/5..."

"2.0","Pittsburgh really needs an izakaya, but a good one. I was disappointed with the execution of the food during my visit. Karage is much better at Chaya than here. It should not need gravy, especially the type of gravy that goes over mashed potatoes.Fried oysters were over done and hard. Not delicate at all like I would expect a panko fried oyster. Pork belly was also overdone.All of the flavors leaned toward being sweet, and were flat.  Definitely a let down, especially considering the price."
"1.0","Would rate at -2 stars if possible. Encountered an aggressively rude pizza driver for this establishment while attempting to park in front of their store. Never made it into the store to order a dozen pizzas for my event, which in retrospect after reading the reviews, was an excellent disruption. Clearly their driver saved me from another bad experience."
"5.0","This may be my favorite restaurant I have ever been to. Not really because of the food. It was pretty good. I had the pumpkin curry. It was good. The atmosphere of the restaurant was just so pleasant and a welcome departure from the Polish joint across the street. I think I am going to stop my elitist beliefs on Polish people. I think that I am most at home at a place like this. It was nice and quiet. Awesome decorations including some Thai General or some kind of military figure. There was a cartoon of a boy and girl with folded hands that appeared to be in love. I was giving up on the entire concept of pair bonding and love until I saw that adorable picture. The atmosphere of Thai Gourmet was so grounded and peaceful. A complete juxtaposition with that weird bar next door. I am glad that they didn't serve alcohol at this restaurant. I am really starting to get pissed off at alcohol and all the evil it encourages, creates and perpetuates. This place had so many cute special touches that made it a unique restaurant. That is what I love about supporting family owned and operated places and not chains. It made me think about the place across the street that was being filmed for Restaurant Impossible. All he does is come into a place that has created their own version of what their restaurant should be and destroys that vision. He changes it to what society as a whole deems as beautiful and acceptable. I think it should be the other way around. As it is in Thai Gourmet."

"1.0","The food was okay but the staff kept doing really racist imitations of a Mexican accent for fun. I'm Mexican myself and I just moved to Pittsburgh and this definitely wasn't the experience I was looking for. Definitely made me feel unwelcomed and uncomfortable. It's obviously a place run by Americans for Americans that don't actually have any respect for Mexican food or Mexican culture. Just because you're cooking 'Mexican' food doesn't make it okay to mock Mexican people. If you're Latinx, beware before heading in here, it's gonna be awkward. But if you're okay with stuff like that, roll on in and get a very okay tasting taco."
"5.0","My go to for Japanese! Perfectly portioned smaller style Japanese street or narrow bar Shinjuku style plates. We literally sampled the entire menu while sipping on hibiki 12 yr.Cocktails were on point with beautiful floral hints  but I still kept loyalty to my Japanese single malts after. Sashimi was well prepared and the cuts just melted in my mouth. The wagyu was cooked perfectly and I probably could've eaten the whole cow if prepared that way.  That would be a pretty long skewer! Long enough to poke an ugly naked guy across the street (sorry had to make the Friends reference)Temaki was beautifully presented and one of the best rolls I've had in Pittsburgh. Overall? Great atmosphere, phenomenal food, and can't beat the price. I'll be back many more times."
"5.0","Pittsburgh has several good Thai restaurants, but this is the best for my money.  Good for take out or dine in, with reasonable prices and very spicy food (in contrast with the rest of the asian food in town)."
"4.0","Another food offering on the Duquesne Campus located in the Duquesne Union Building on the fifth floor. Think Chipotle with a few differences. Namely, you can get non plastic tasting queso on your burrito or for your chips. Your queso suck Chipotle! Otherwise, you have basically the same idea here. Build your Burrito or El Masivo Burrito (huge two tortilla burrito), Tacos, Salad or Bowl with all the usual suspects. A few different items I'll point out that I liked were the whole wheat tortillas, jalape√±os, pickled onions and crunchy strips. The crunchy strips are and awesome way to get some crunch in your burrito. They also offer a couple of sauces to doctor up your creation like the cilantro sour cream sauce that I got. It's pretty amazing.  The big star for me was the queso. I threw it on my burrito and got a side for my chips. $10.45 for everything including a drink.So the food itself was great. I honestly would take this as a Chipotle substitute (not the same but will do).  However, the people they have working here really need to up their game. My burrito was literally falling apart before I even paid. The girl said she was going to try another tortilla but she still ripped it and just folded it up in the foil anyway. A manager saw it and told me I would probably want a bowl for it so she handed me one as I was leaving. Good thing because it totally fell apart. More effort guys! And with Chick-fil-a next store, be a little more friendly. It's like night and day. Happy and cheerful with the Chicken, doom and gloom with the Mexican!"

"4.0","Had an amazing dinner here. Upon arrival there was a 30 min wait which is expected for a Saturday. Instead of waiting we sat at the bar. It was a really busy night so the bar staff wasn't as attentive but i'm sure thats because there were so many people there. I ordered a stoli doli to drink and it was so good i had to have another. It's vodka that has been siting in pineapples for a week. Great drink for ladies and men and it will make you a bit tipsy lol. For food I ordered the tenderloin with lobster tail and my boyfriend ordered the 16oz bone in filet. For sides we had the gratin potatoes and the mushrooms. All amazing picks especially the gratin potatoes. The only thing I didn't like that much was my steak. It was suppose to be medium and they gave me medium well. It had slight char taste which I hate so i just loaded A1 sauce and it made it better. I didn't feel like sending it back, it wasn't that big of a deal to me. Would I come back definitely. Great food, atmosphere, wait staff, and drinks."
"4.0","I've eaten here several times, and I really enjoy it. The food is always great. The service has been pretty good; sometimes I think the staff get a little overwhelmed and it can be a little slow. It's one of my go-to restaurants when I want something safe for out-of-town guests.I'm knocking off one star because I feel that the menu can be a bit limiting (and the hit or miss service)."
"4.0","Delicious food at an affordable price. Meat cooked perfectly (we had the chicken Shawarma and lamb shish kebab) with flavorful sauces (highly recommended trying the side of garlic sauce for $0.25!) hummus is fresh and delicious. Highly recommend stopping by for a quick, casual but tasty meal!"
"4.0","I have ordered from here a few times and each meal was delicious! You get a large portion for relatively low price and their daily specials are a great deal. I recommend the chicken caprese sandwhich and the jimmy the greek. Their shoestring fries are excellent! They give you just the right amount which leaves you feeling satisfied without the fried food guilt. Very friendly staff and quick service. I recommend calling ahead."
"5.0","My friend and I had dinner at Mezzo last night. The food was WONDERFUL. We had the fantastic arancini and I had the special that had pork, a carrot creme, brown butter sauce and other wonderful ingredients. The wine was really great. The service is what really stood out. Emily, our server, was AMAZING. She might be the best server I've ever had. Our wine glasses were never empty. She was patient. Attentive but not overbearing. Very personable. GO, request Emily, and ENJOY!"

Among the items we ordered were delicious subs filled with high quality meats, fresh tortellini salad (which we are still enjoying), and unbelievably addictive, home-made potato chips.  The price was very fair, delivery was on time, and all the needed utensils were there - no mistakes. We will order from Craftwork again."
"4.0","Pretty cool spot if you want open air &Rooftop. I'm told one of the few or only rooftop spots in Pittsburgh. It was pretty crowded but had good timing w a table leaving. Can get table service but can be slower than going to the bar. I still opted for table service. There is food avail upstairs but I only saw a table eating a soft pretzel. Looked tasty from afar.A few mix drinks; one being an Aperol Spritz. An Italian drink or a new Real Housewives of Beverly Hills fav depending on who you ask. (Feel free to judge my reality TV show watching & influence when trying drinks). The first & second tasted totally different and were served in different glasses. But why send it back?! A raindrop hit my arm & before I could say, 'hey is it...' a quick downpour started. This resulted in half the bar rushing to the other half that had a roof. Quickly the retractable roof was shut & the evening was saved. The staff was nice in getting towels to wipe down tables and chairs."

It doesn't matter what your proclivity for spice is or what ethnicity you are. It's indigestible. You will experience the worst stomach pain over the next 18 hours. ChikN sandwiches are damn good when not ordered damn hot."

"5.0","This place is great! Such a cute and tasty option for brunch! Good service and they put the check in a treasure chest which is adorable and then give you chocolate treats in the chest. Loved that small yet adorable feature! My only complaint is they served us all small water bottles. Although convenient, too wasteful so that is the only change I hope to see! Go visit here, it's great!"
"5.0","Went to Pittsburg for couple days and the uber driver recommended this little joint in the middle of the strip district.It is an old place with tons of flavor, i had the pepper steak hoagie... too much food for a soul with fries included. This is a MUST to visit in this lovely city."
"2.0","Not that great of a place to eat.  The salad wasn't too bad.  Chipped ham sandwich was nothing special and barely had any taste. Overall wouldn't recommend this place."
"4.0","I feel like such an ass for not giving them five stars but hear me out:The food is seriously to die for! There's no way this isnt the best Mexican food in Pittsburgh... and if it's not, PLEASE recommend a better place on this review, so I can see it.However...It's simply not enough food. I had ONE meal from here that I hated, but I dont hold that against them. Aside from that, I've never had a bad experience here. But for the price, it is not enough food!Here's a tip:Order beef lengua burrito/taco(s). It's so amazingly supple & tender, while still having that intense seasoned beef flavor! Because of these guys, I will never eat a beef taco again...unless lengua is on the menu!"
"5.0","This place is a hidden gem!!! The best tikka Malala ever had! Definitely coming back."
"5.0","Was an employee at this Excellent Establishment for 2 years, left on great terms and enjoyed every minute of my employment. I'd highly recommend trying the food and I'm bummed that I can't personally serve you and watch you enjoy it. Watching the food come out was always amazing and the head Chef Mike does nothing but a perfect job on every dish! The seasonal menu is always creative and uses nothing but the freshest indigence (I know, I had to go get them). The owner Nick takes extreme pride in his work and makes it his personal goal that you enjoy your experience. TRY IT OUT!!!!"
"4.0","Yumm... I live out of town but whenever I am here, I go to Prince of India for lunch.  I find the staff very pleasant and the food is yummy.  The flavors are not overly spicy but complex and rich.  It tastes like they use some ones mom's recipes with a pinch of this and a dab of that to get the flavor just right.  Many of the Indian restaurant's I've tried taste 'flat' - like the spices come from a mix and hot but not flavorful.  That's why, next time I'm in Pittsburgh you'll find me lunching at Price of India."
"5.0","I absolutely LOVE this place. I used to come here with friends for dinner. It's a family style place and the staff is super friendly and nice. I usually order their Massaman curry, Ma Po Lo, tilapia basil and the pumpkin curry. Every time that I come here, I leave satisfy and happy. Another plus is that it's a byob place and from what I remember,  they don't charge you for the glasses. We also came here a couple of times for birthdays and they were nice enough to give us plates. Recently I have been doing takeout and realized that they give you free dessert . One time we got the tapioca with coconut milk and corn which I didn't think that I would like but I definitely do now after trying it! The only downside to this place is that it doesn't look as nice as other restaurants but it doesn't bother me since the other factors outweigh that."
"5.0","Been craving Indian food for a while and Tamrind doesn't disappoint. Tikka Masala wasn't super red/orange so you know they know how to cook and don't just add food coloring. Samosas are always good but the goat biryani was the best! Food was/is amazing."
"5.0","So your whole family has moved to Pittsburgh and you visit for the first time and try to decide if you're ok with this new reality. Your brother in law takes you to Peppi's.  The nice guy at the counter helps you figure out what to order. You get your sandwich. Life is good. Pittsburgh is good. You can vacation here for the next decade, no problem."
"4.0","I won't pretend that Little Nippers is crazy gourmet or anything, but it doesn't try to be. I eat here once a week and it's consistently good food. A great Pittsburgh establishment with friendly staff.I recommend the pastas -- baked ziti or mediterranean in particular --  and the artichoke hoagies."
"5.0","Salems is amazing! They have the best nann in the burgh! I've never tried something there I didn't like. Would highly recommend it."
"3.0","Service was great. They were attentive and very friendly. The food is overpriced. I'm glad that we ordered a pizza during Happy Hour because it would not have been worth the original $19. It was a nice place to sit for Happy Hour, but I wouldn't go otherwise."
"4.0","Fast service. Good food. I had the 'famous special' (just its name) with Corned beef & sauerkraut on rye. Nice blend of thousand island & mayo. Two pickle spears & large drink for under $10. One free refill...Oh yeah, there is an ok bar too"
"2.0","Not deserving of the rave reviews. Breakfast is cheap, and definitely very poor quality. Grease is the common theme in food, and though it might taste OK a first, your digestive tract may say otherwise later. The space was cramped, we sat almost elbow to elbow with other guests, with my back a foot from a brick wall. The waitresses were extremely fast, except for coffee refills. Almost felt rushed because the bill came so quick; probably had something to do with the busy line in the waiting room. And why, in this day and age, are you cash-only, Pamela?"
"5.0","A fantastic neighborhood spot. As a Greenfielder I might be biased, but this is one of the best Pizza joints in the 'burg. Only once I have a been disappointed by the quality of Rialto Pizza. Yet the many check-ins before and after more than make up for that one occurrence.Given its location it caters to those ordering take-out or delivery. Only a few times have a noticed people dining in. They are quick and true to their word. Every time I have ordered, the food has been ready within 15 minutes. Though their pizza (and specialty pizzas) is fantastic, what keeps me coming back is their desire to meet consumer needs. Occasionally I have made special requests, and they always obliged. Their service continues to meet demand. It does not hurt that they secondarily function as a mini-beer distributor.If you are looking for a cheap, tasty and friendly place to eat a pizza, where you can also customize your own six-pack of beer, this is the place to go!"
"2.0","Two stars is a gift.....and only because we were able to sit outside by the river and the weather was beautiful. Actually, we could have sat anywhere, since the place was not busy (after our dinner, we found out why it was so empty). There were too many complicated things that went on with our waitress to mention.....let's just say, she was not attentive or gracious in any way. There were issues with both of our meals(and we are not complainers)...with a reluctant effort to resolve! Nothing good to say about the food, or the service! Needless to say, we will not be back!  Sorry, Jerome...we were big football fans, but not a fan of this place!"
"1.0","I'm going to bed hungry tonight because we choose to have dinner at Jerome Bettis' Grille 36. So we went there on Saturday night before the Steelers -Chiefs game. It was a present to our 19 yr old son for his birthday. He really wanted to go and I looked at the menu and gave it a thumbs up. We got there at 6:30 (to be fair, remember, Saturday night before a big game) and they said it would be a 90 min wait. Okay, our son really wanted to eat there. We were seated at 8:15. We ordered the nachos and my wife wanted one of their appetizer Bloody Mary's. They were both excellent, the Bloody Mary was served with 4 garlic shrimp that had a lot of taste. The nachos were 8 inches high and were some of the better ones that I have had. Jalepenos, olives, a lite cheese sauce, and a tasty ground beef. Yum. Before they came, we all ordered burgers, let's say about 8:30-40. At 9:30, our embarrassed waitress came back and said that there had been a meltdown in the kitchen. I'm a reasonable guy, I said 'just bring us good food, and all is well'. Three burgers, fries and that's it. The manager came over in the meantime and bared his soul that he didn't know why this was happening, but it was obvious that we were about the fifth table he had spoken with and he'd had enough too. By 10:00 we had had enough.  No burgers in site. Our waitress did her best to keep us there and actually paid for the food and drink that we had. I couldn't let that happen, and gave her cash for the food and drink consumed. I also gave her a healthy tip because this wasn't her fault. It was actually her that suggested the YELP review because Jerome and management read them. So here is your message. Great concept. Really good wait staff help. Questionable management, and some of the worst execution that I've seen. 4 hours and no entree?  Unacceptable. I'm not going back. I don't want a coupon or a phone call. I'm reviewing this to tell you if you execute like this, you won't have a business. Save yourself."
"4.0","Cinderland's is a brand new Brewpub/Brewery that just opened up in Lawrenceville.  My boyfriend and I stumbled upon it during the Lawrenceville cookie tour, and it happened to be their first day open.  The place itself is really cool! They highlighted some of the unique details of the old building they're in and incorporated lots of brick and subway tile, which I loved! The space was huge too, both big parties and small parties alike could easily feel comfortable there.There were only 5 beers on tap, but they seemed to have a good mix of different styles.  My boyfriend ordered the NE IPA and I ordered the Berlinner Weisse.  The Berlinner Weisse had a tart and fruity taste, so if you're a fan of sour beers then I would definitely recommend it!  I didn't try any of the food, but everything on the menu sounded delicious!  I would love to come back with a group of friends and try more!!!"
"4.0","I met a friend here for beverages on a Saturday around lunch time. It was highly recommended by one of my patients and had been on my list of go-to places for awhile. Parking in Bloomfield can be difficult but it was not overly crowded and there was a side lot about two blocks away that charged $1.00/hour. We were greeted by an employee the moment we walked through the door. She took us up to the counter and began taking our orders. My friend had the coffee passport and had three options to choose from. They were out of one option however the employee was willing to customize one of the other two to serve my friend. I went with my usual coffee shop purchase but with a twist - a chai latte with almond milk. I could not tell if there was an upcharge for the choice of milk but for a classier, 'higher end' shop, the price was not bad. Though we only purchased drinks, there were several food options such as pastries, breakfast items, sandwiches, and they were advertising that they are now open occasionally for dinner.When scouting for a place to sit, most of the tables in the front of the shop were filled. We continued walking towards the back of the shop and man, it went on and on!! We found a cozy corner beside a high top table that had two lounge chairs with a TV mounted above. It was perfect for privacy and for us to have a chance to catch up!If you are in the area and need a beverage to warm up or a light lunch or maybe even a cafe styled dinner, this is a place to check out. Friendly employees, clean, orderly, and quaint, and reasonably priced."
"5.0","I will have to revise my scale after eating here for six months I can say that this is by far the best Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Dosa:  well done, crispy (as it should be), spiced to perfection.  I love the pickles and chutneys they serve it with.  As far as I know this is the only place that serves dosa in Pittsburgh.The curries:  I have tried the mutter paneer, the saag paneer, the aloo gobi among others.  As far as I can tell this is an extremely consistent restaurant (huge sucker for consistency).  They spice the dishes well, have good portions, and aren't afraid to ad the heat when you ask for it (it is hard to get 'hot' in Pittsburgh in my experience). The naan are well done and appropriately buttery.  The samosas appear to be handmade and are excellent as well:  always crispy and hot and filled with a spiced potato and pea mixture.  The chutneys are, also as far as I can tell, freshly made at least with regard to the cilantro chutney.Love this place!"
"4.0","We made the trek downtown to the Capital Grille for my mother-in-law's birthday in Jan 2013. We're not regulars to this classy (i.e. expensive) of an establishment so I only have a few other like-restaurants to compare our experience to. Overall, the experience was quite nice. We ended up here during Restaurant Week which gave our wallets a break. Our server was prompt and attentive even knowing our bill would be much less than the normal 3-top. I ordered clam chowder, a filet with grilled shrimp, and a cheesecake desert. The soup was delicious and my boyfriend tells me the cheesecake with fresh fruit was also great. (I was too full to eat it and had it boxed up to take home. They boxed it up very nicely for me, but since I was flying out of town for work the next day, he ate it!) My steak, ordered medium rare, came out a bit more rare than I would have expected (cool red center instead of warm red) but it was tender and delicious none-the-less. The grilled shrimp was overcooked but I wasn't annoyed enough to complain at the time. Now, I wont be back anytime soon, but that's more a factor of the price than anything else. It's definitely a special occasion kind of place for me, and I have a number of other places like that to try first!"
"4.0","I came here on a Wednesday night for dinner and really enjoyed my evening at Mezzo! I was here with a group of colleagues for a work social dinner and it was a perfect spot! (For those of you who don't know, Mezzo is on the 2nd floor of Sienna Mercato and the 3rd floor is the beer garden). For starters we had a very unique, and original salad. I wish I could remember the names of things... but I can tell you it had kalamata green olives, parmesan cheese, potato, and pistachio in it. It was so good, and the size was pretty decent, we shared 2 of them as an appetizer among the table of 6. For dinner I had the mushroom risotto, which was alright... I say just alright because looking back I wish I would have ordered a pizza. I tried the pizza with truffle oil, mushrooms, egg and some other toppings and that was amazing! I have been dreaming about and craving for that pizza ever since I tried it. One nice thing is they do half orders of the pastas, so at least I didn't order too much pasta before I realized the pizza was better! They have a wine bar upstairs on the 2nd floor as well, and a nice selection of drinks to choose from. Overall, it was a good night and the food was really good. I will definitely be coming back here."
"1.0","First time ordering: the delivery guy couldn't figure out how to ring my very ordinary buzzer, the beverage order was wrong, and though the dish was called eggplant Parmesan--it was hard to find any eggplant. Just soggy breading. I won't be ordering again from these folks."
"1.0","Unbelievable! It took so long to wait for the food. Food is also very overpriced, even more expensive than Japanese restaurants in NYC. Flavor is not as good as expected. I will never come back again. Not trying to be mean, just honest opnion."
"5.0","A must for anyone who loves food.Favorite place in the city to eat.  Chicken and rice and everything nice. The spinach is next level. And i can almost guarantee you never had a hamburger this good before, then theres a chicken burger as well which is my favorite.    dont get me started on the Ramadan buffet if your not even Muslim its worth fasting to go to.   Their use of spices is top notch.  And the turkish delights are phenomenal like truly phenomenal. They also have a market next door with fresh meats and all that.   This place is the secret gem of the city."
"4.0","My son invited me here to have lunch with him since he works nearby. Located in the 20th block of Penn Ave Cafe Raymond is a small restaurant that serves breakfast and lunch. You basically order at the counter, choose a seat and you are given a number for your order that you take to the table.Most items on the menu are ala carte with the exception of their special combinations. I decided to order the cooked vegetables on foccata bread, My son ordered the Cafe Raymond burger special that comes with a choice of side and dessert. He ordered a side salad and a red velvet cookie. All sandwiches come with potato chips. Bottled water and other beverages are located in the refrigerator behind you that you can help yourself and pay for it.We had our food in record time. My vegetable sandwich was so rich and filling I was amazed I could even finish it. It was so good! My son's burger came topped with an egg as well as your usual toppings. He told me he loved every bite of it. He also ordered for dessert a red velvet cookie which is his favorite. He loved that too!  Outside seating is available if you want to sit out on a hot day. Bike parking is nearby and you probably would do well to park on Smallman St and walk over. Please note that reception is bad in the place and there is no free Wi Fi.I was thrilled to have my first experience here and am looking forward to trying out their other offerings. Believe me you won't leave hungry!"
"3.0","Kiku has a 'go green' deal. If you buy your personal chopsticks for $5.00, thus saving trees,  you can save $1.00 each time you use them.   Big deal!  Have you seen some of the prices here?  And anyways, I always thought chopsticks were made out of bamboo, which is renewable.  That little rant aside, I was here last night for the first time in quite awhile.  A lot of the food here seems to be some version of teriyaki or tempura.  I'm not all that familiar with Japanese food, so I don't know if this is the norm.  Pittsburgh doesn't have very many Japanese restaurants to choose from.  But feeling a little adventurous, I tried the Unaju, which is grilled eel on a bed of rice with Kiku's own eel sauce.  Y'know, I'm glad I tried it 'cos it was really good.  All of their entrees come with their amazing miso soup.So why only a three-star rating?  It just seems that Kiku is a little pricey for what you get.  As another poster says, it's one of the few non-gigachain restaurants remaining in Station Square.  But even the lunch menu ain't all that cheaper."
"4.0","10000000 stars but service, food is decent & overly priced. Would recommend the food in different states. The Pittsburgh location doesn't meet expectations."
"4.0","Food and staff are great! Also they always have great music playing here. I live pretty close so I eat hear once a week. If you haven't been here definitely check it out, you won't be disappointed."
"4.0","I love diner food, and Pamela's is a great example. The only downside: a very un-diner-like wait. It seems like no matter how early I show up, it's impossible to get seated in under 30 minutes on a weekend.Do I feel like it's worth the wait? Yes, but I try to make it count. I usually order Gail's favorite eggs AND some hotcakes and eat half there, with half to take home.I have had omelettes here before, but they are very standard diner omelettes: brown/slightly overcooked. I prefer Gail's eggs because they come perfectly cooked, not overdone.Honestly though, I feel like the Lyonnaise potatoes are my absolute favorite thing. I am craving them right now."
"5.0","Finally made it to this much heralded caf√© in the Bloomfield section of the city. Delicious freshly prepared food and coffee drinks. Pleasant, efficient service as well!"
"4.0","So I love this place. I live dangerously close and honestly go here maybe every 2 months. They do an excellent job with flavor, spice and heat. If you order a 7, be warned, your mouth will burn by the end of your meal! I love their pumpkin curry, which I generally get with shrimp. They don't give you tiny shrimp either, you'll be getting the big ones. A friend of mine always gets the duck curry, which is sweet and savory, with big chunks of duck and pineapple, along with a delicious curry note. I've also gotten the fresh rolls (not anything to write home about, and not the best in the Burgh), the chicken satay (pretty tasty), and the fried spring rolls (they aren't super flavorful, but they are salty and crunchy and delicious). Their Tom kha is magnificent and highly recommended. Lastly, I encourage you to try their pad thai. It's really, really tasty! It has a super peanutty flavor, with Rich sweet and savory notes in perfect balance. They add in egg and protein of your choice, plus bean sprouts. It also reheats really really well. They serve everything with rice, and will even add in complimentary brownies for dessert. I'll be back."
"3.0","I have now eaten here a few times and nothing was as good as the first time.  The food gets less spicy each time.  You would think that when you ask for 'Indian Spicy (beyond 1-10 scale)' it would at least always be hot, but that isn't the case. What I got was mild at best. That being said it no longer has anything that differentiates it from Peoples Indian or any other Indian restaurant I've eaten at here in Pittsburgh."
"5.0","Probably the BEST pancakes and hash we have ever had!!  The combination of blueberries and ricotta was amazing.  Do not pass this spot by---"

"5.0","came here for the first time today and loved the vibes and atmosphere of this restaurant -- contemporary and casual. the service was friendly and timely; the server we had was very helpful! I ordered the YAKI UDON and it was yummy but was also pretty thick so it's filling. the noodles were good and nicely coated with the sauce, runny egg yolk, and the extra veggies. but when I finished the noodles I was left with a layer of mixed veggies coated with the sauce--not a bad thing but I wish I had a little more udon. my friend ordered the MISO RAMEN and she really liked it!we shared also a VEGETABLE TEMPURA: good but pretty ordinary. and a SHOCHU COCKTAIL: their rotating flavor was strawberry and it was very yummy--but be careful since you can't taste the alcohol. the only main con is that this restaurant is on the pricier end. but would definitely come back again to try other dishes and drinks!!tldr;food 4.5/5drinks 4.5/5service 5/5interior 5/5"
"5.0","So good, so fresh, so authentic. One of the best places to eat in Pittsburgh, in my opinion."
"5.0","My favorite taqueria in Pittsburgh! I've been there many times. The chicken tacos are my go to... so much delicious flavor for an affordable price! And you MUST get them on corn tortillas - so much better than flour!"
"5.0","I love La Gourmandine Bakery! I come here every once in a while during my lunch break at work. The pastries and sandwiches are always freshly baked and delicious. This time around I tried their Almond Croissant and the Pickle Prosciutto sandwich. The croissant was really good with a lot of almonds. The almond extract is pretty strong, so just be aware of that while ordering it! The sandwich comes on a fresh baked baguette, which is nice and crunchy on the outside. The prosciutto and mini pickles make for a great mix of flavors! The atmosphere is very relaxing, sometimes I enjoy reading a book here because it's pretty quiet. The staff is always friendly an inviting. Overall, it's a great place to stop by when you get the chance"
"5.0","I finally experienced Caffe Mona. We went with a group of 4 on a wednesday morning. As good as it gets.Also one of the brunch places where everything this perfect. They have many savory options.We ordered Buttermilk Caramel Pancakes, Veggie Omelette and Berries French Toast. The pancakes are very fluffy and ligth. By the end of our meal, we were full as well as content with what we ate. Definitely visit if you are looking for exciting brunch options.They are SO goood, BTW highly, highly recommend the Berries French Toast."
"5.0","Stopped here on a whim for lunch and wow am I happy we did! So good!!When you walk in you order off a board and then they serve your food for you. They have a wide range of sandwiches and salads as well as coffee and bakery treats! They also serve breakfast all day. I hear the pancakes are delicious. Everything here seems to be made fresh including their baked goods, chips and bread.I decided to get the club sandwich which was turkey breast, hickory smoked bacon, muenster, spring mix, tomato, avocado spread & chipotle aioli on whole wheat. I had no bacon on mine but she put it on the side for my husband! The sandwich was spicy and had such a good taste. I also had the side salad with a lemon vinaigrette. It was a nice leafy salad and the dressing had a good flavor that complimented the salad and red onions on it well. The chips that come with your sandwich are also homemade. They are a crisp ruffle chip. Plus I could not leave without trying an oatmeal raisin cookie! SO moist and fresh!!The service was super friendly and everything was quick. Definitely a nice spot in the strict to grab lunch and a tasty Sammy!"
"5.0","Definitely the best breakfast I've had in Pittsburgh so far. Highly recommend. Great menu and fast service!"
"3.0","It's alright. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. Good drink options and beer selection. We were seated for 20 minutes while we debated getting up and leaving but decided to ask a server why no one had come by. A female server came back about 5 minutes later and jokingly mentioned she was arguing with the manager about something and thought her section was clear. She also sat down at our table to chat with us. I always find it odd when people do that.We ordered spinach dip which was pretty good. I had a salad which was okay and the chicken was really dry. My husband ordered a black and blue burger. It was cooked appropriately and tasted okay. Nothing crazy special about the place."
"2.0","FYI - the two stars is related to service during recent business dinner.  The main courses were excellent (I had the halibut and probably the best cut of fish I have eaten this year)!  The sides, mashed potatoes and creamed spinach were warm at best, when delivered to table and cold midway through meal.Service was spotty from the location of our table, right on the corner of a busy pass through lane into the larger dining room.  Waiter disappeared for long stretches at a time.  Ordered a drink and thought I would have to go mix it myself.  After our main course he disappeared again and didn't ask if we wanted after dinner drinks/coffee.  We also got the vibe that they could care less about our business.  Indifferent service always gets me steamed.  Maybe an off night or maybe this is how they operate at this location.  I pass through Pittsburgh once or twice per year on business but probably won't be back to this location for a business dinner."

"5.0","This was an amazing find. We always eat around this area and have never heard of it oddly until yesterday. I don't know how it snuck up on us! My girlfriend and I were extremely impressed with their food, prices, portions, decor, and overall atmosphere. Yesterday, we bought the mocha French toast, the Nutella crepe, and a cappuccino. The French toast came with a shot on the side you could pour on the toast which was delicious, the crepe was huge and was full of flavor, and the cappuccino was delicious in the mason jar! Our server was great as well! Our favorite part was the patio. They have rainbow umbrellas hung up all over the place with other cute decor all around! They also gave all the tables a free plate of cream puffs which were to die for! I was so happy I saw this place advertised on yelp, otherwise I don't know if I would have ever found it!! I would highly recommend!!!!"
"5.0","Simple, expedited, and poignant: Chikn is the most apt alias for a place of its name. Its menu is small with only a few varieties of prepared chicken. Its service is fast, and they use an electronic system to deliver it to your table. And its chicken's spice level is POIGNANT! If you want to feel a smoldering, rising pain in your mouth after consumption, get the Hot or Extra Hot. Otherwise, stick to the lower spice level, because they have some tremendously spicy chicken! Overall, the flavor is rich, and the price is good! Highly recommend!"
"5.0","The weather wasn't great the night we visited,  which meant we had our choice of seating.  The staff actually looked amazed that someone had braved the snow to come get a bite to eat.  The host was pleasant. He later also became our server.  The only bizarre part was that he sat us next to the only other table of people in the restaurant.  Their party had about 12 people and it just would've been nice to have a bit more space and less volume.  But we got past that by admiring the variety of memorabilia on the walls.  If you are a football fan of any sorts,  it's definitely interesting to see the pictures,  jerseys,  trophies and more. I ordered a burger.  It was prepared just as i requested and quite tasty.  We did order one of their specialty cocktails also and enjoyed it too.  I'd love to come back during football season. I imagine this would be a great place to watch the game."
"1.0","Service 0/10Pizza 4/10First 1 star given on yelp. If you're going to be open on Carson Street Saturday night after 2 A.M. - you gotta have slices rolling and ready to go. Waited over 10 minutes for a few cheese slices. Most customer friendly pizza places have pre-mades ready at the front counter . No such thing here. Everything done in the back, they were doing who knows what in the back while I saw employees eating pizza themselves before getting served. Below average pizza, undercooked and floppy. After 10 minutes I asked for my slices and was given a rude 'be patient'. No, be FASTER.  Will never return. Just go to benny's."
"5.0","One the absolute top breakfast spots for me!  Easily in my top 3. Yes there is normally a line but it moves at a good pace. They get you in and get you out. Yes it is cash only. If you are reading this, now you know. Take cash! If you don't read this and just show up, any number of signs will tell you cash only. Go get cash!Now that that is out of the way, I can't think of anything not to like about this place. I love the crepe style hotcakes especially the Chocolate Chip Banana Hotcakes with Whipped Cream. And it is real whipped cream. They have a crispy layer and so much flavor. And they are big! An order of eggs any style, sausage and Lyonnaise Potatoes tops the order off. Those potatoes are phenomenal! Add a little hot sauce and you have a real winner.  If you find yourself here you absolutely must try the hotcakes if nothing else. The other items are a small step above most diners but you come for the hotcakes.It's a busy place and the staff is rushing around like crazy to get everyone taken care of so they really didn't have time to be rude or ignore you. They were attentive, helpful with questions and fast. Let's put it this way, after a 30 minute wait we were seated, ate and paid (with cash) in under another 30 minutes. One thing I did find a little strange is that the restrooms are upstairs.  But you get to walk through a pretty cool foreign gift shop to get to them so all is good. Sorry, I can't remember the ethnicity of the gift shop but I spent a little time looking around and found it fascinating.  Check it out!"
"3.0","If you're looking for a good burger at lesser price, Five Guys or Red Robin may be for you. If you want to drink good beer while listening to music and enjoying nice decor, the burgers here are comparable yet more expensive. If you're in Lawrenceville on a Tuesday, Smoke's burger rules."
"3.0","Great hotcakes. No so great wait.  The hotcakes are worth trying, but there are other places in Pittsburgh that have much shorter waits that I prefer."
"2.0","Decidedly 'meh'. Pad Thai was bland and chicken was on the nasty side  (they did include A LOT of noodles though). Wife's drunken noodle was edible. Spice level highly variable. Might have been an off night for the cook but won't go back anytime soon."
"4.0","Relaxing Environment. Not an extensive beer menu but that is not a bad thing because the focus on perfecting what they have. Will def be back again."
"3.0","Good quality corned beef sandwich at a good price. However, I asked for my rye toasted and was greeted with 'we don't toast here.' How do you not toast a corned beef on rye???"
"4.0","Tasty, good food, sometimes a long wait, CASH ONLY (which is why I gave 4 stars, although I realize this is a business decision)."
"5.0","Simply put, high quality food at reasonable prices with a good location and enjoyable restaurant atmosphere.  Ate on the deck outside overlooking the street, had the croissant BLT.  Bacon was jam packed with flavor, croissant was stupendous, greens were fresh.  Downstairs can get easily packed, but upstairs was super open and spacious.  Highly recommended."
"4.0","ordered 20 whole fried wings for my family and was pleasantly pleased with those crunchy pieces of pleasure.  I will definitely be ordering again real soon......like maybe tomorrow lol"
"4.0","You know when you've been away from home for a few months, and when you go back, your mom  force feeds you an absurd portion of your favorite dish? That's Salem's. An unassuming community center-like set up attached to a market with massive portions of Middle Eastern food at a reasonable price. As an Indian person who appreciates similar flavors, I was thoroughly impressed and plan to go back at some point. Food:Think Pittsburgh portions. Multiply by 2. That's what you get for around $10. I went for the rice and goat curry. Not a big goat fan but that dish made me one. The meat was soft and peeled off the bone. Since they made it bone in, the flavors were excellent. I would highly recommend it. My friend had the palak paneer which was equally as good. Definitely not for the weight watchers crowd and I wouldn't say it's the best middle eastern food I've had, but for the price and portions, it was well worth it.Service:Arguably the best part of the experience here. Everyone is a 'brother (or sister)' there, or so that's how you're addressed by the staff. I kind of appreciated that- it made it feel more homely. Ambiance:I was on the fence about how the place is dressed up. Much like other reviewers said, it's kind of like a cafeteria or community dining hall- uncomfortable and worn black cushioned chairs, rickety tables, scruffy tiled floors and no fancy decor. They could probably do a better job keeping the place clean but the feel of it definitely fit the atmosphere as a whole. It would almost be weird to see it suddenly turn into an upscale or modern place..."
"4.0","Had the Chicken Tikka Masala. It was good, although I definitely wish it could have been spicier, or that we were given the option to make it more or less spicy. I tried my friend's Tandoori chicken, and that was disappointingly dry, which was weird because my chicken basically fell apart when I poked at it with my fork. For some weird reason, the music that was playing seemed like a mix-tape of someone who was tripping pretty hard on acid while doing hot yoga. Not too keen on that, but, you know, don't sweat the small stuff. The rest of the place seemed pretty cool. My friend asked about the private rooms upstairs, and the waitress said that it seats 40 people, if anybody is interested in that. Portions are pretty decent, but definitely a little expensive for a poor college student like myself. I will most definitely be back during the wednesday night college specials (BOGO w/ student ID)."
"4.0","Went here for lunch and loved it! We had the fried catfish nugget appetizer, the fried cod sandwich, and lobster sandwich with lobster bisque on top. Yum!"
"5.0","Been to every comparable steakhouse in Pittsburgh and Capital Grille is the best. Food and service is always five star. Great night out! I highly recommend the prosciutto  wrapped mozzarella!"
"5.0","It took me forever to get here having gotten distracted when it first opened by spending the summer in Boston [sigh - I missed so much this Pgh Foodie Summer], so my friend C beat me to the punch and designated this 'Taco Taco - the Taco place'. It's pretty awesome and a fantastic addition to the South Side and Pittsburgh.The inside is small and simple with a counter and bunch of built-in barstools surrounding the Taco making station. It seats about 10 at the bar and another 3-4 at the window looking out on a busy carson street. The board is straightforward on the selection of 5 tacos. They are nicely sized and extremely juicy and the aroma is just amazing out the door, pretty much literally. Especially for the fantastic price of $3/taco. Yum, by far, my favorite is the Carnitas [Pork], followed by the Chicken, then the Carne Molida [ground beef]. I haven't gotten to the rest yet, but I'm sure that will happen sooner than later. Also I'm totally digging the Mexican artistic style of the chalk board. All together, love it and hope it sticks around for a long time. Last piece of advice, either come hungry or leave as soon as you're done. As you are immediately next to the food prepping, the aroma is constantly up in your face, and those who linger will end up eating and eating until you're through the entire menu. Gotta love it."
"1.0","Worst service I've ever seen, employee working was rude and unhelpful. It's a shame because I rarely write bad reviews but wow, pittsburgh is usually a great town.. If you can avoid it, don't go here."
"4.0","When I came here for dinner on a Friday evening, there was no wait and I had fantastic service. My brother ordered the fried fish sandwich with friends and loved his meal, and we had the shrimp poppers as an appetizer, which was also great. there's a large selection of sauces with the shrimp poppers - we chose the Asian sauce and the classic shrimp cocktail. Both were good! For my meal, I had the crab Mac n cheese on the crab fest menu for October. I wasn't really a huge fan because cheese-it's were crumbled on top, and I'm not a huge cheese-it fan. The crab on top was great though! I just wish there was more, especially for $25."
"3.0","So I'm totally over this Pittsburgh trend of new restaurants that prioritize presentation over flavor.  My first experience with Umami left me underwhelmed.Our party of 5 arrived on time for our 7:30 resy on a Friday night, and the restaurant was pretty packed.  In fact, we had to wait 15 minutes for our table, which ended up being in the 'traditional seating' room.  The ambiance all around was pretty sick, from the sunken-in wood floor seating to the muraled windows and skylight.  Still some kinks to work out though--a large mounted fan provided ventilation for what would have otherwise been a super stuffy room, but also continuously blew around our napkins and the nori on our plates as we ate.  I guess they worked with what they have in this very limited space.As for the service, we repeatedly worried that our server had forgotten about us, as we waited quite a while for our orders to be taken, and there were large gaps before we received our drinks and our meals--the food all came out at different times, and our meal ended with her intense struggle to split our check correctly.  Granted, it has to be super awkward to serve in that room--you kind of have to kneel down to be level with where we were sitting, but we were all left with the feeling that perhaps it was her first night on the job.Our drinks did not disappoint.  The falling petal sake was beautifully floral without being overbearing, the black tea was served in a generous pot, and the beer was priced right.Foodwise, my fiance and I ordered the SHIITAKE MUSHROOM and JAPANESE EGGPLANT ROBATAYAKI, the BRANZINO SASHIMI, and the TONKOTSU RAMEN.  I also tried to order the SHISHITO PEPPERS, but were told that they were out of season with no replacement.  Whomp, whomp.  The robatayaki were pretty disappointing, with very little char from the grill and little flavor besides the hint of seasoning from the brushed-on tare, which was all goop and no taste.  I was expecting mushroom caps for the shiitakes as previous Yelp photos showed, but received sad little vertical slices of mushrooms instead...is this a cost cutting measure?  It certainly did not enhance taste or portion size.  The ramen slightly redeemed the meal.  Admittedly, I'm very ramen-picky, but the broth has decent enough flavor but ironically was pretty one-noted...I believe I would diagnose that with a lack of umami. No complexity.  Still, it shouldn't be hard to make a great bowl of soup with the crap-ton of pork fat that is tonkotsu ramen is based on, so they met expectations in that respect.  My far less picky fiance was very pleased.The big letdown, however, was the branzino.  I ordered it to satiate my curiosity, as I've never before had raw branzino.  And I know it's a mild fish, but this sashimi had zero. flavor.  I mean, there was a tiny kick from the same weak tare brushed on top, but the fish itself had not even a hint of taste, fishy or otherwise.  Also, it was chewy.  High quality sushi (unless it's something like squid or octopus or clam, obvi) should melt in your mouth.  This did not pass the test.  In awe of its absolute tastelessness, we passed this around the table to check if maybe my taste buds were out of order.  They weren't.  Sad--for the $8, we could have almost gotten another ramen bowl instead.  If I had to guess, perhaps they're still figuring out how to cure their sushi (yes, real, fresh sushi has to be cured before it's served--otherwise, it's tasteless).The only feature of our food that was spot-on with what we experienced in Japan was the presentation.  Everything was artfully and tastefully plated, without being overdone.  And at the very least, unlike other 'trendy' restaurants that have opened lately, Umami is not overpriced.  However, much like the restaurant space itself, it was a visually beautiful meal from start to finish but functionally, fell woefully short."
"3.0","I just had to try the fries..  want to see what the buzz was all about.   Decent deal $1 fries with side of nacho cheese.  It was a small amount. The fries have a little bit of season salt on them.  They were flavorful. They are probably better than some other fast food restaurants - definitely different and cooked properly.    They were good - but not life changing."
"1.0","I wish that the owner knew how to talk to people who have an issue with the quality of their food. I wouldnt suggest going here unless you want a hard time from them."
"5.0","If there's 2 things you need to try here it's the corned beef hash and the hot cakes!!! The line is always so long here - I waited about 45 minutes for a seat on a weekend morning but there's a lot of shopping nearby and the time goes by pretty quickly. The corned beef hash with potatoes was not overly salty, a little greasy (but also this is a diner and sometimes you need a little grease), and a pretty huge portion to split with someone. We also ordered the Morning After Breakfast Special which comes with 2 eggs, a meat, and hotcakes. We got the strawberry hotcakes and they were DELICIOUS. The hot cakes are not your average pancake - they are a little thicker than a crepe with delicious crispy edge and filled with sour cream, brown sugar, and fruit (depending on which one you order). They are perfect as is and I didn't even need any syrup on them. Overall, a filling and soul satisfying meal that will not break the bank."
"5.0","Love this place! We were able to bring both of our dogs. The back patio is dog friendly, but it was full so they moved a table out front by the window for us. They brought out water for the pups, and had quick and friendly service. Will definitely be back."
"4.0","This is the first time I have been to a restaurant like this.The menu is based around what is in season, the meat & cheese board is a sampler of food experiments by the chefs and what is available, and the staff waits on you like you are royalty. At least for your first visit, you must get the meat & cheese charcuterie board (or cheese only if you are vegetarian). This, more than anything else on the menu, showcases the creativity and originality that these chefs are putting in every single day to make this place the success that it is! My board had a pate made of beef knuckle and mustard seeds, cured ducked breast, a sheeps milk cheese with an espresso rind, a raging bleu cheese, and a 'loaded baked potato bread', beef-and-berry jam, among several others. The arugula salad with fingerling potatoes as a side dish was exceptional, as well as the port meatballs (although they are much more dense than the meatballs downstairs!) The pizza with pepperoncinis has an excellent crust, tangy cheese, and delicious peppers. However, the peppers are the hottest peppers I have ever had, and the menu gives you no clues that you will need to fill up your water glass several times to get through it!For my birthday, they also served us a complimentary glass of champagne which capped off the night beautifully.In my opinion, this isn't a place to grab drinks with friends or a quick bite on a weekend; that is more downstairs or at the biergarten upstairs. However, if you want a romantic, new food adventure, check this place out!!"
"1.0","THEY DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND WALK TWO DOORS DOWN TO PRIORY FINE PASTRIES.   Came into Arnold's tea today with a trained ESA (emotional support animal) the African American woman behind the counter berated me and my friend. Claiming if we didn't have paperwork we would not be allowed in the store. As we were getting the documentation that my friend needed the animal for her panic attacks the woman said that we would need to wait outside while we did that. This place is discriminatory against people with disabilities and so we took our money and our ESA down the street to Piories Fine Pasties. The coffee is amazing, the sweets are delicious and you are greeted with a smile and respect."
"4.0","A must when in Pittsburgh, a great breakfast spot w/ crepe style pancakes. Service is great and the price is right. Cash only!"
"4.0","We came for brunch on Memorial Day. They staff were super friendly and communicated regularly as they were slammed with a lot of folks. The decor was all really lovely. I liked the blue hydrangea theme that was held throughout the restaurant. There was also a nice variety of seating options.For food, we have the egg, cheese, and chorico sandwiches, French toast, and feijoada. Everything was delicious! Their bread was super fresh. The cherico was nice and meaty. The French toast had a nice blend of sweet and fruity flavors. All their prices were super reasonable as well. I saw a lot of tasty Portuguese treats in the bakery care but was too full to try any. Next time! Definitely worth checking out if you want some chill, Portuguese brunch. Keep in mind it can be a bit of a wait if they're busy."
"5.0","I love this place! Every time I'm in Pittsburgh I come to eat here and they never disappoint. The Skolar I the best! Kevin has taken care of us twice and he's the best!Great food! Very casual ambiance! Definitely a must visit. I always recommend to everyone I speak to that I know is coming to the area!I look forward to my next visit."
"2.0","I'm docking stars on this one because the service was awful and the drink menu was fairly shallow.  This is strictly a beverage place with a few bar snacks available to order.  We only ordered drinks and were largely ignored.  They were busy, but not slammed.  Our server just kept apologizing (for forgetting us) and moving at a pace that exhibited no purpose whatsoever.  C'mon, man...you can move quicker than that!  Especially when you kept forgetting us anyway!  The view is spectacular on a rooftop downtown...that is the only redeeming quality here. Also, the ladies room on this floor was atrocious..."
"1.0","Went in here for a late lunch on Friday, June 15. There was a game that night and there were some people there but it was not crowded. Our waitress brought us water and disappeared for over 20 minutes. She then came back, took our orders and left. it was another 30 minutes before we had any food and no waitresses in sight. I had the blackened Mahi Mahi tacos and they were not good. The shredded 'lettuce' was some very old limp green pieces that I picked out and the fish was over seasoned and dry. I ate it because I was very hungry but otherwise wouldn't have. While we were eating a waiter came over and tried to serve us a beer, which we didn't order.Don't bother stopping in here."
"4.0","Cinderlands 3705 did a great job with a 2 story inside/outside remodel of the old building.  I was there for a lunch business meeting, so I can't talk about the beer offering at this point.  We started with 3 apps a soft pretzel, pierogis, and goat cheese curds.  The pierogis were fancier than most with the ingredients and were good.  The curds were very good as well with their sauce.  The soft pretzel was a basic soft pretzel and the cheese sauce did the trick.  For my meal I ordered the fried pig ear bahn mi.  It was a bit too hard core for me.  I couldn't get it down, but that's my fault I guess based on ordering a fried pig ear with pate.  The other entrees like grilled cheese and burgers looked good.  So if you don't like real bahn mi with pate don't risk it as adding a pig ear makes it more adventurous."
"4.0","I gave Redbeards a second chance, and I was very pleased with my experience this time. Redbeards is pretty much the only restaurant downtown where you can order late night food. Not only do they serve food until 1AM, but they also serve their entire menu. I ordered the quesadillas, which were exceptionally tasty. I like how they put olives and jalape√±os in them. I did not have to wait too long for them, and the bartender was nice and pleasant. Overall, I believe that this restaurant and sports bar is a solid staple in the downtown community."
"4.0","This is the last Chinese restaurant left standing in what used to be Pittsburgh's Chinatown. It sits on a side street next to the city county building making it kind of a hidden gem. My coworkers and I arrived as soon as they opened and it filled up pretty fast. We were in and out within 30 - 35 minutes. If you are looking for a quick spot for lunch, definitely give this place a try. I ordered general tso chicken with white rice ($8.88). I also specified that I wanted white meat because some places make general tso with dark meat. The rice was a little hard and not as 'sticky' soft as I hoped it would be. One thing I noticed was the batter to chicken ratio was off. There was definitely more batter than there was chicken and that could be why it was so crispy. As much as I like crispy chicken, I wish there was more chicken under all that batter. You also get your choice of soup or an egg roll. I ordered wonton soup and was very pleased with the size of the wontons. Some of my coworkers ordered egg rolls and I have to say they were probably the biggest egg rolls I have ever seen. In my opinion, the general tso was good. I can't say that it beats sesame inn or jimmy wans, but if you are looking for a nice and clean authentic Chinese restaurant I would recommend coming here."
"3.0","I came here for breakfast on a weekend. We arrived when they opened. It was a brisk morning, but it was still nice to have the cool breeze blowing through...until the cook went outside to smoke right in front of the window.  Inhaling cig smoke was a huge turnoff and really irritated us.The tea selection is modest but I was beyond thrilled to find decaf English Breakfast.  For my meal I ordered the spanikopita crepe.  I was going to go for an omelet, but thought I should try something different that I can't get just anywhere.  The crepe was filled with spinach, onion, and feta cheese. It had an amazing flavor, but the crepe was rather rubbery. I actually felt like I was eating pizza rather than a crepe.  My friend got an omelet that she really enjoyed and she also got the Nutella dessert crepe. Again, her crepe was very tough and rubbery and there was only a small smear of Nutella on it. I think if they tweak their recipe for crepe batter it could have far more potential to be an amazing food option. The omelet choices are pretty great. That's what I'll stick to, should I return."
"5.0","This is my new favorite spot!!! The food is always on point..breakfast and lunch is bomb! Also the service is great! Thanks Pete and Morgan!"
"4.0","I have eaten here twice now over the last two weeks. I had the Kung Pao chicken and the Szechuan chicken lunch specials (both $7.44 with tax), once with the hot and sour soup and once with an egg roll (getting two reviews here). Pittsburgh has crappy Chinese food, but this is the best place that I have come across so far (I've tried about 4-5 other places now). It does mainly cater to American's in regards to taste, but the two dishes that I tried were, in fact, pretty tasty. You will have to order the dishes extra spicy if you like spicy food, because the little chili pepper is not saying much. Now the lunch specials are a great deal: The portions aren't exactly generous, but it's about the same that you would get at a Chinese fast food place for about the same price, but with higher quality.The kung pao dish was loaded with water chestnuts and mushrooms (apparently I am the only person on earth that hates these two things), and had a hearty supply of peanuts. The S-chicken had baby corn, bell peppers and broccoli. On both occasions the fried rice was nice and moist. The hot and sour soup was on par with some of the best I've ever had and the (American) egg roll may have been the best egg roll I have ever had. The second time I came here I had to wait 20 minutes in a line out the door, so be warned about this possibility. Two nice touches about this place is the service and the decor. Most Chinese places throw service out the window but this place does not. They aren't big English speakers, but they stop by a few times to make sure your beverage is topped off. The interior is very pleasant with dark red painted walls and nice pieces of soft art.I plan on eating here more in the future.Food Quality/Taste = 3.5 StarsPortion Size Given Price = 3 StarsPrice = 4 StarsService = 4 StarsExperience with Staff = 3 StarsDecor = 4 Stars"
"2.0","Our waitress was pretty rude and took a long time to take our drink and food orders (it wasn't that crazy busy). People who arrived after us were taken care of before we were. The specials weren't all that great either. A lot of other Pittsburgh bars offer drink specials during Pens games and this place didn't. I wouldn't recommend this bar as there are far better bars/restaurants in the area."
"4.0","I really like this place. I have gone there several times and the food on the restaurant side of the store is always fresh and good. The last time there I had the hummus (best in the burg) and spinach pie. Also had the chick pea salad , yummm! In the past I have had the chicken kabab, and kind of a chickpea stew served over rice. It is done steam table style so you can look over the food before you buy so you can try different things. Try the goat meat it's really good. The decor is like a cafeteria, so fancy it's not. The prices aren't fancy either. Two can eat for about $20, including a piece of baklava for dessert..If just rating the food I would give it 5 stars"
"4.0","We did a little pregame drinking here (and when I mean a little, I actually mean a lot).We basically got here around 1 and killed a few hours before the 4pm Steelers game.Ordered a bunch of deep fried goodness to go along with said beer.Server dude was great.  There were TVs.. There were football games on.  Drank said beer.  A good time was had by all."

"2.0","I've heard good things about this restaurant but I was disappointed with my visit. The menus and floor were pretty old and dirty looking. The restrooms were a mess. I ordered the veggie burger and it was just bad. It had no flavor except for the cabbage and onion and just tasted like a mushy egg roll. The server asked me why I didn't eat my dinner and I told him, yet I did not speak to a manager or get anything off my bill. The sweet potato fries were good if they weren't cold, and I got basically half the portion of my friend who got the same fries. I won't be returning."
"4.0","After driving around to find a none franchise restaurant, we came upon Rialto. Strange parking for a flat lander (had to circle around and try again). Odered Ital hoagies, came out on nice warm bread...could have been more meat but for price....good.  One suggestion...need ICE for drinks!"
"3.0","Was headed somewhere else but saw this place so decided to give it a try. Friendly bartenders. Small but had a long bar along one wall and a row of tables against other wall. 6 Tv's behind bar. After reading some of the food reviews decided to just drink a beer and head to my original destination."
"4.0","Great experience at Cafe Raymond. Pleasant and friendly staff had our experience here off to a good start. I like the organized way of ordering and seating people. Our food was very good. Enjoyed the corned beef sandwich. Ricotta blueberry pancakes, sausage and potatoes were great. Scrambled eggs were overcooked. Everything was served hot which always earns high points for me. Overall we had an great experience and will return."
"5.0","This place is great! We ordered takeout for the bourbon salmon, the superburger, and the zucchini lasagna. The salmon was delicious, and the lasagna was amazing. I've never had a vegetarian entree that tasted this good. Also, with the three entrees we got three free cookies and some sides. The cole slaw was just ok, but the garden rice and garden salads were phenomenal. I wish we stayed at the restaurant to eat because the diner vibe was really chill and warm. Definitely recommend this place to anyone staying at Days Inn or Comfort Inn because it's just a short walk away!"
"5.0","Very good and authentic Indian cuisine! Highly recommend this to anyone! The Gobi Manchurian is my favorite appetizer and Chicken Chilly is my favorite entree."
"4.0","If you're in the mood for tacos, but you're indecisive (like me), this is a good place for you since the menu is quite small. The menu isn't the only thing that's small here, the dining space is also tiny; I estimate it to seat about 13 people, give or take?From selecting a few items from the menu, it seemed to me that the toppings for each taco were rather similar, except for their American taco. My carnitas, spicy beef, and nachos were all topped with cilantro and Mexican farmer's cheese, making them look the same. Taste, however, wasn't identical between the three items, but still quite similar. My favorite was the carnitas: very tender and flavorful pork topped with fresh ingredients. What's not to like? The small price tag also makes these tacos even better. At only $3 a taco, you could try one of each without breaking the bank. Overall, great place to quickly grab some tacos. The service is friendly and super fast. Another perk: they're even open late on weekends!"
"5.0","I just left & oh my gawd THE best burger (sorry Five Guys) I've ever had!!!!!! I'm new to the area and wanted to escape my Airbnb & came across this gem thanks to YELP! I built my own burger & chose slaw as my side. A bit expensive, but worth every penny."
"5.0","This is my favorite Japanese restaurant in Pittsburgh. Hands down. One thing you must know is that if you wanna go at normal dinner times on a weekend, you must get a reservation. This place is small and very, very popular. It is located on top of Round Corner in Lawrenceville. The entrance is around the corner on 38th, pull on the dragon handle and go up the stairs. The bar tends to be pretty busy, but their drinks are balanced and well thought out. I've gone on two occasions, one with another couple, where we ended up sitting across from where the grill is located on the bar. Although it was really neat to see, it was really, really hot. Like so hot, we were switching seats.  The second visit we were in the private room with a large party of 11. Anyway for drinks I ended up ordering the Wolf and Cub which is a beer with a side of sake with a dropper of hibiscus syrup. It was delicious. For starters I highly recommend their skewers, and honestly they are so cheap, it is totally worth it. I recommend the bacon wrapped quail egg, the pork belly, the kabucha pumpkin and the meat ball skewers. And yes, I had all of those skewers. Not to mention my husband and I ordered 4 of them. Granted the skewers are small, but pack some incredible taste. Also I had a taste of the savory pancake, which was pretty tasty. It had bacon, cabbage and some other deliciousness, also highly recommend to share. For our entree, I ordered their Tonkotsu Ramen, which came with a delicious marinated egg. Gotta have the egg... It was a good ramen, but not mind blowing good. Those skewers were.... Overall, for a restaurant that has small plates in their menu, this is a total bang for your buck. I love this place and I look forward to more of those meatballs."
"5.0","The egg white avocado breakfast sandwich was delicious! The bread was fresh and the pesto aioli really made the sandwich. So happy that a good breakfast/lunch place came to Penn Ave. Can't wait to stop back in for another meal!"
"4.0","Once again Vegans win...seriously, I was scared going to an asian restaurant (especially Japanese which is fish heavy) in Pittsburgh to try and eat dinner. No need. We headed up a month or so ago to test out their ramen as was recommended by a friend. We were sat in front of the bbq area at a bar top. The place was packed. The server made it clear that there were more vegan options that what it seemed so she let us know what was up. We ordered a ramen dish to share and at least 3 appetizers. All were great. 'Super vegans' may not like the fact that their food will be cooked on the same surface as fish...there is no vegan side to their kitchen so know this before you go and avoid it if your ethics don't allow you for any kind of cross contamination. Service was quick and friendly, the vibe in the space was young and fun. The place is decorated well and is super tightly packed but it works. The ONLY downside was that the roof must not be insulated because it was FREEZING in there. We were happy to be sat next to an open fire pit for warmth. We actually avoided going back during the cold snap because we were worried it would be uncomfortably cold."
"2.0","We were in from out of town and Pittsburgh's Light Up festivities were going on, so let me start by saying it was very busy.  Capital Grille was one of the only restaurants that did not have over an hour wait.  We were seated quick enough, the waitress, who was working on 13 hours was very pleasant.  Unfortunately it took an hour for us to get our main course.  This was also at 9:30 at night.  My wife ordered a filet well done, it was (at best) medium rare.  I ordered mine rare, which it was,  but the entire outside was charred and tasted it.  They took them back, and I'm pretty sure microwaved my wife's to well done and made a new steak for me.  My wife was satisfied with hers, but mine still lacked any flavor, and for a $50 dry aged strip steak, I couldn't believe it.  I am NOT a steak snob by any means, but I've had better steak from Kroger seasoned with just a little salt and pepper.   I will say though that the waitress was amazing, the manager was very apologetic and kind as well.  They ended up comping the entire meal and gave us a desert as well, but we left hungry.Again, they seemed to be having problems this night altogether.  I can only assume they had a new chef/cooking staff."
"2.0","Good food, but really not a REAL sports bar as advertised. A few pictures on the wall and 7 TV's doesn't make you a sports bar."
"5.0","I stopped by for a quick bite in between appointments at West Penn. The food was delicious, staff was super friendly, and I was able to purchase some of their amazing hot sauce for my own kitchen right there. I couldn't wait to brag about the amazing eats to my foodie husband. We will be returning together!"
"3.0","The rainbow umbrellas brought me here. Came for a weekend brunch with 3 friends on the patio. The sun was blazing on us through the cracks of the umbrellas and my legs got a bit sweaty on the chairs, anyways...ELVIS ($9): Yummy! There was way too much peanut butter for me though so I did scrape some off and I thought that the bacon and maple syrup were all great flavors together.BYOB($4?): They charge you per glass you use. So we brought orange juice and champagne for our own mimosas and were charged for the 4 glasses. No problems there, I was too scared to open the champagne at the table so I asked the waiter to help us and they opened it in the kitchen.Our food was tasty, but we had problems with the customer service. We weren't checked on very much, and actually ended up staying past closing or close to closing (3pm) because we were waiting around for a server but ended up waving another girl down because our original server seemed to have abandoned us..I would like to note that they do not have tap/filtered water here and serve small water bottles at a fee.I would like to return! But the service was slow when there weren't many customers on the patio."
"5.0","Great tasting. Relatively cheap. Large quantity. Good atmosphere. Kind employees. The General Manager was exceedingly patient and kind with me when I was ignorant of the ordering process the first time I went. One of my new favorite pizza places in the Burgh."
"5.0","Honestly, very impressed witj this brewery.  The spot is amazing. The food was fantastic. Loved all the beers I tried there.  Excited to experience more of their beers in the future."
"3.0","Nice hidden restaurant about the stairs. Great ambiance.The udon that's on the menu is actually yakiudon and was not clearly explained to me by the waiter. Service was okay, a bit slow. People kept trying to give us dishes that weren't ours. (We should have taken it but we were trying to be righteous.) The okonomiyaki is OK. Felt pretty undone, but liked the sides and how it was really warm. Tonkatsu udon was also OK.The udon was meh. I would not recommend tbh.Pricing is OK, everything is just A-OK. Note: Everything is pretty salty."
"3.0","Ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and Chana Masala for delivery while I was holed up in my dorm, working on a late-night project.The food is a lot saltier and less interesting than I remembered.  I've had better experiences ordering from them, so I'll give 3 stars instead of 2, but the sauces weren't great.  Chickpeas were pretty good, but there was too much onion for my tastes.Ordering through CampusFood.com was convenient as usual, and the delivery guy was polite for the whole three seconds he was standing there."
"4.0","At the beginning had to wait awhile  for the waiter after complain with a manager everything went excellent food is good atmosphere is really nice after all everything went good thanks for the good time"
"4.0","I can't wait to try this place again! I'm VERY picky about my burgers... I'd say I'm disappointed in most burgers that I try. Luckily, my meal at Burghers did not fall into that same sad category! I went with the Fox Chapel. The burger was a blend of beef and mushrooms, topped with goat cheese, greens, balsamic vinaigrette, pickled onion and avocado. I added a fried egg on top because I can't eat a burger without it. They serve their patties in a 'smash burger' style where they come out pretty thin. I was worried that would automatically translate to the meat being overcooked but was pleasantly surprised that my medium rare order still had pink!I went for a side of Mac and cheese instead of fries. It wasn't that hot when it came out, but the flavor was great and the noodles were still a little al dente, which I love. I'd try it again. I also tried a bite of my friend's fried chicken sandwich and liked it a lot. Our server, Bridget, was wonderful. Friendly, polite and easily answered all of our menu questions. Note: it's BYOB for now but they should be getting their liquor license shortly! There is a great bar space with the potential for a huge draft list. I'll be back once that happens!"
"4.0","Visited Tamarind during my last trip to Pittsburgh. I was with a large group so we ordered several different appetizers and main dishes. It was great because it allowed me to taste many of their dishes. Everything was spectacular. I highly recommend Tamarind."
"5.0","The number 1 halal food in town.  Big portions, reasonable prices and consistent food quality every time.  Alhumdulillah"
"5.0","My friend and I came here for a Saturday brunch in the strip district. You walk in and wait in line to order so you have plenty of time to peruse the menu on paper and whiteboard. I ordered the Rueben and coffee... my friend ordeeed pa  the Rueben minus the meat. Both were delish. I would rate mine as perhaps the best I've ever had. I can say without reservation that I will be here again"
"4.0","I was at Federal Galley for a happy hour and decided to try the food here! If you've been to federal galley before you know how hard it can be to pick a spot! However Guapo's menu stood out to me and I decided to try it! I ordered the shrimp tacos and they came with refried beans and fried potatoes. The meal was $15 and included 3 tacos. I have to say, the food is really good! The shrimp tacos were full of flavor and the salsa on it was delicious. Only issue was the tortilla was a bit dried and hard to chew. However, my friend had the quesadilla and definitely enjoyed it. All in all a great place to grab food if you're at Federal Galley. Will definitely be back!!"
"5.0","This has be the largest Panera Bread I've been to; seating isn't an issue here. The food was traditional Panera with the great bread and the prices were the same. Service was quick and easy."
"1.0","If I could give this place 0 stars believe me I would. My family and I decided to come here to grab food before a Pirates game this past weekend. We were thoroughly disappointed. We got seated right away, we had a party of six. A waiter, who never even introduced himself, came up and said that their dishwasher had broken and they needed to wait for glasses. After 15 minutes he brought out 4 waters, all in plastic cups, and didn't even realize he forgot two. Right then and there we placed our order for 3 alcoholic beverages, 2 sodas, an appetizer, and 6 meals. 10 minutes after placing our order the waiter told us 2 of our drinks were unavailable, it took 15 for him to bring out all of the drinks. After this we did not see him until 45-50 minutes out when he asked if everything was okay. We had no appetizer, everyone's drinks were empty, and we still didn't even have silverware. He went into the kitchen and made up our appetizer himself, chips and queso, frankly it tasted as if he didn't even heat it up because it was hard and cold. We eventually got our food 10 minutes after this and it came out cold. Don't make people wait almost an hour for cold food. Definitely a mistake choosing to eat here and I definitely won't be doing it again"
"1.0","They gave me the wrong soup. My wife's order was wrong quinoa bowl. They also had 2:30 minute old coffee. Had to wait for a new brew."
"5.0","Incredibly flavorful and well spiced food. This is flawlesss Indian food. Tastes slightly different and better than any Indian food I've had. I highly recommend the tikka masala and the saag.Service seemed a bit slow at times, but the wait is well worth the food. You can't go wrong here!"
"4.0","Honestly I have no idea what has taken me so long to patron this great little bistro; especially since it's within walking distance from my house. But hey, better late than never. We were the first customers for brekkie on Sunday and the wait for our food was a little longer than most places. However, that wasn't an issue because our meals were clearly prepared with a pride and passion for food. We started with a cheese plate that came with a crepe and marmalade and that could have been a shared meal itself. For main courses I had the pesto crepe with side salad and my boyfriend had the Polish Hill crepe with a side salad. You guessed it, his was similar to eating a pierogi with cheese, mashed potatoes and caramelized onions. I had s bite and it just melted in my mouth. And for me how can you go wrong with a pesto crepe? It literally tasted straight from the garden with fresh mozzarella, cherry tomatoes and the most fragrant basil. Service was very good and the interior is quaint, inviting and comfortable. They've even got a back dining patio. Everything about this place reminded me of Europe without trying too hard. It's a theme that flows organically throughout. Also want to mention that the menu has so many choices without being overwhelming or too much to take in."
"5.0","The back patio is strongly recommended. I also think they get their coffee grounds from a different supplier, or they managed to get them fresh. Really good coffee espresso so far I have tried."
"3.0","We were very excited to try this place. I hate to say that we thought it was over priced and not the best. We both got burgers, which were $15. They were very greasy; tasty, but greasy. We also got a beer that was $9 and mediocre. I've been to many places in the city that had better food and beer and are much cheaper."
"4.0","I visited Umami when I first moved to Pittsburgh.  While the restaurant gave a fun izakaya vibe, I thought some of the food items were lacking.  I recently visited (a whole year late) and had a better experience.One of the things I like about Umami is the late Friday and Saturday hours.  The restaurant itself is compact, nested on the third floor where Cantina is.  The entrance is on the side street though.  It was a bit hard to find it during the evening.  It's almost like a izakaya speakeasy! I like what their drink menu offers.  The specialty drinks are well-priced and easy to drink.  Another thing I like about Umami is the serving size.  It's not one of those restaurants where my stomach cries over how small the portions are.  For a party of two, their appetizer size are pretty big to share.This time, we ordered the chawan mushi, chirashi, tonkotsu ramen, and some handrolls.  I did not like the tonkotsu ramen a year ago.  The bamboo shoot was overpowering the broth.  The broth in tonkotsu ramen is key, and they didn't deliver it.  Since Umami owner is a co-founder of Ki Ramen, I figured to give the ramen a try again.  I LOVE THE TONKOTSU RAMEN THIS TIME AROUND!  The broth isn't very salty but fatty enough.  My favorite part was the bone in cha siu.  I'd come back to Umami for that alone.  The chirashi has a beautiful presentation and good quality fish.  The handrolls were decent, but a little pricier and not much different than other places.  The chawan mushi egg was silky and smooth.  I'd love to come back and try the rest of the menu next time.  Now that I discovered some stand out items, it makes me want to revisit."
"5.0","This restaurant is fantastic! It's located in this adorable house and has a great atmosphere. I had the garlic naan and the chicken tikka masala. The naan came with four pieces and I wish I had ordered my own instead of sharing it! The pieces were a little small so one order can potentially feed one person, if you have a big appetite (like me.) The naan came with three different dipping sauces and they're were all delicious! One was a white yogurt sauce, a spicy ketchup tasting one and a green zesty one. The chicken tikka masala was so good! I wish it came with more rice though! The ratio between meat and sauce and rice wasn't even in my opinion. The meal came with the meat, vegetables and sauce in a little dish along with rice and this zesty sauce. It was delicious! The sauce was creamy and yogurty! And the chicken was so tender and flavorful! This restaurant is truly a gem, come check it out!"
"5.0","This is my second time here and I have to say the people were very nice. The food was awesome and will most  definitely be back."
"4.0","Definitely a nice place to go for a date or special occasion. The space itself isn't too big and you're literally right next to your neighboring tables, but I didn't mind because it goes with the cozy, dimly lit, intimate atmosphere.  The service was also very good.  Since we were seated somewhat near the hostess station, we got to see several parties arrive and it seemed like there were lots of regulars and people greeted by name.  Loved the personal touch.Food is also good.  I ordered the pork chop and it was cooked really well.  Slightly juicy and flavorful.  Also, Sausalido is BYOB, so make sure to bring your favorite bottle of wine!"
"4.0","Really friendly service and great cozy atmosphere. The bread was okay but the dessert more than made up for it! I would probably recommend skipping the 'vegetable medley' as it is just broccoli carrots and cauliflower no asparagus but the pasta was good. Will be coming back for half off wine Monday or Wednesday :)"
"4.0","Food truck this time and still Good Tacos.  The food truck was nearby and decided to give it a try.  Tacos were $4, so a little more expensive.  Had the Carnitas with mexican slaw, pico de gallo, cilantro and lime and the Carne Molida, a spicy beef with sauteed bell peppers, jalpenas, farmers cheese, cilantro and lime.  Both were good.  There were a variety of hot sauces available including a Sirachi Bacon that was very interesting and had some heat."
"1.0","ABSOLUTELY UNHYGENIC & IRRESPONSIBLE!! Im giving them 1 star because u cannot give 0stars.. Its the WORST place to have food. I had hair in my food and when i complained the waiter said 'so many people have taken food from the buffet so we dont know whose hair it is.' He blamed other customers very comfortably. The attitude is worst and he said.. sir we cannot help. PLEASE DONT GO HERE!!!"
"3.0","Yes!  Another BYOB in the city! This spot has recently under went a much needed spruce up.  We sat in the back (purple) room for a larger party for my friends bday.  The space was a bit tight but the staff with friendly even though we were kinda in their way the whole night. I am a sucker for green curry.  Its normally the only thing I ever get at thai restaurants.  I am by no means a thai expert but possibly a green curry expert.  I am like bummed because I am 99.9% sure I order shrimp but I got chicken and was too hungry to care.  It was delish tho! I also like that I can talk myself into the dish being mildly healthy because I can get brown rice. ha. Pros: Affordable. BYOB. Friendly service. Great flavors. Cons: Parking can be a pain.  The restaurant is tight. Got the wrong food- kinda, but it was still good. haha. Overall:  I will be back!"
"2.0","My first impression was this store is a mess... finding a halal butcher in Pittsburgh is a pain... seems like this is the only option I've had.. some product are expired (again, watch out the ED!!)  The people working here was not nice.. I don't understand why they are mean.. well, at least one of them, not all of them. the quality of the meats is okay, just a bit pricey compare to what I have back in Houston. I hope I have had better luck next time.. or.. I hope I will find another halal butcher..."
"1.0","First time visiting Pittsburgh in love with the city . Decided to visit this bar in my birthday and the worst customer service. First i went to the rooftop and after 10 min order my drink they close down the bar at 10:45pm . Still i wanted to stay went downstair to finish my drink and order more with our friends. Few people at the bar nice music. Request drinks and the bartenders for drinks and said i would be there in a sec . Call her attention saying in a polite way and the reply was always I would be there in a sec. Still has been 2 hours and yet no one has come to serve us .Hope that the two young ladies serving the bar learn to have good manners and have the best customer service."
"4.0","If I could give this place a 3.5 stars, I would. It was good, but not great, and the wait was really too long. This place really suffered from the high expectations of the 20 minute wait and the around the block line were simply not met. I had the corned beef hash, and it was actually pretty good, but far to greasy, and it didn't need to be. I also got eggs, sunny side up, which I suggest, not just because they were good, but to avoid the awful looking scrambled alternative. All in all, not bad, but the hype is probably undeserved."
"5.0","Had 2 bowls for dinner last night. Ingredients very fresh, filling & delicious. Staff was nice & helpful. Thanks Cori & Gesika!"
"5.0","This is our go to spot we must have every year. The fries are fabulous. The hoagies are amazing. The people are truly the best!  LOVE LOVE LOVE This place.  See ya again when we come into town!  Bring it to NC soon!"
"4.0","This was part of a brewery tour my boyfriend and I did. We hadn't even heard of this place until a few weeks before. A burger joint that started making beers? Why not. We went expecting to see mostly basic styles and nothing to stand out. It was easily the best beers of the day.We hit the spot up during happy hour. There was a fair number of people at the bar but not many at the tables. It was a Wednesday. The bartenders were on top of it. Service was prompt and they noticed and refilled water glasses.We ordered some French fries to munch on with our beers. They are half off for happy hour. We ordered the rosemary fries for something different. If you are a fan of rosemary go for it. The fries were crisp and flavorful and there was a lot of rosemary.We ordered a flight of four beers to try a variety.Belgian Block - This golden ale was delicious. The banana notes really come through. This is smooth and easy drinking. It drinks easier than the ABV suggests. I would definitely drink this, especially on a hot day when I want a lighter style.Grand Duchy - This was a solid porter. I always am skeptical when I see cherry in the description since I have found it to be a tricky ingredient in beer. This was my least favorite of the flight. However, I think that says more about the other beers than this one.Oat Black Water - This is a very good stout. I do tend to go for dark beers. It was smooth and had great roasted notes.Oat Black Water Barrel Reserve - Easily the best beer. You still get all the roasty flavors of the original, but the aging with maple kicks up the sweetness and brings out the chocolate notes more. You definitely pick up the notes from the barrel.Overall this was four solid beers and a good experience. I'm not sure how often they change styles but I will check the list to see what new ones they come up with. Although I would go back and drink any of the four I had today."
"5.0","I think the originals are always the best.The hot cakes are incredible, the French toast is also very good.Today we tried the lyonnaise potatoes and they were some of the best ' home frie' style I've ever had.The service is fast and the restaurant is clean and cool with lots of pictures.The only thing to remember is that is cash only like the other Pamela's."
"5.0","Awesome.  Great sandwiches, high quality groceries that even hippies would like!  Super friendly owners!  A must to stop and shop and chat."
"2.0","We were excited to try this place but had a disappointing outcome unfortunately. We ordered chocolate and mocha shakes which were yummy. Plus the goat cheese balls were delicious. My husband also liked the pickle brined fried chicken sandwich.But the rest was just eh. I ordered the Liberty burger at medium but it was well done. If you're going to be a burger joint then how can you get that wrong? The secret sauce on it was so bland and I was so excited to try it!  My friend ordered a custom burger and they forgot his sauce. Another friend ordered a sandwhich and it didn't come out as how ordered either. I don't know if they are still just getting used to things including their ordering app but hopefully they get it together.The burgers are small for the price. Our bill was about $50 incl. tip for two and that didn't even include alcohol!  I don't see us going back."
"5.0","The food tastes great, the price is fair, all is good."
"5.0","I'm not sure why it has taken me this long to get here but oh man! Apparently they have $7 Morningside burgers on Sundays (bacon, egg, and cheese burger). Of course I went with that and upgraded my side to mac n cheese. Everything was delicious. Also got a flight of their craft beers. Highly recommend their Harvest Moon winter warmer. Also they play great oldies music here. Currently watching some football on TV too. Might be my new Sunday hangout. LOVING IT."
"5.0","Alright, I went back with my fiance and my father. The food was AWESOME.My fiance got the octopus, and my dad and I got the burgers. Everything was superb. The fries were seasoned perfectly, the burger meat seasoning was on point. We ordered some beers too and of course we all loved those as well.The one chef has cooked at a few restaurants I've been to and it's really great to see him making food at this level! Definitely has gotten even better over the years!If you are looking for a good beer and some pretty stellar upscale bar food... check this place out it will not disappoint."
"5.0","The sushi at Kiku is the best you can find around, IMO. The service is always great too. The restaurant is lacking in style and lighting, but who cares if the food rocks."
"5.0","The best paneer tikka masala in the city! Also you need the Gobi Manchurian appetizer in your life. The food is so consistently good at Tamarind - never am disappointed. Though I love to grab take out, the ambience here is really cool. Not very much parking in the front, but situated on a street that makes it easy to find a spot elsewhere."
"4.0","Great made to order burgers on quality buns. They have some healthy options too, with a burger/mushroom blend and a veggie burger. I love their fox chapel and Mexican burgers. They have a few places open in the Pittsburgh area. One of the better burger joints for sure. A big beer selection too."
"3.0","I want to like this place. It's small, they seem to care about what they are cooking. You can see the chefs right at the sushi bar, which is where we sat, but the food was just ok. We had a mix of things including drinks:Tuna Sashimi -good, really goodMiso Ramen- meh, have had betterKing Trumpet Mushroom- okMacaroon- goodChirashi- a little disappointingOverall, I hope this was just opening week jitters. I think I will try it again."
"1.0","This was the worst pizza I have tried to eat in a while.  I ordered the Buffalo Kafta Pizza.  First, if it was prepared correctly, it would still be disgusting.  They take what I assume is Frank's Red Hot and put it on top of bread with cheese on top of that.  I thought they would have a regular pizza with the toppings dipped in a butter/hot sauce, not the straight stuff out of the bottle.  Needless to say I could barely stomach a few bites.  THEN I noticed that the cheese was not even melted.  Please see the picture I uploaded here...you can see the raw cheese in the slice I pulled up.  Bread, hotsauce, un-melted cheese = nastiness.To top things off they were out of mozzarella sticks so they had to call me.  They wanted to substitute instead of refund because I ordered via Grubhub so I went with the hummus.  This too was disgusting and oily.One and done with this place, I will never order from here again."
"4.0","I have been here a few times I usually order carnitas on corn tortillas it is my favorite. I have ordered their nachos and you get a huge portion of them for the price it's enough for three people to eat. The line can get really long especially on weekends but the employees move fast it is not much of a sit-down restaurant it's more for grabbing a quick bite to eat. I ordered their special taco once it was the orange chicken with wasabi sauce it was good but it was really spicy and I like spicy food but I couldn't finish it. I'll definitely be back to order more tacos here."
"4.0","Really famous place, and that's why we chose it. But I wasn't a huge fan of the pancakes they make since they're so thin. The food was pretty oily, and the eggs were not the best."
"5.0","My food goal for the summer is to eat everywhere i haven't been in the southside. While I could be perfectly happy eating the BLT at Piper's on a daily basis (vindaloo bacon! ), there is an endless abundance of restaurants in my neighborhood and it is unfair to eat only at a few choice places. I hadn't gone to Doce before. It's always pretty busy when I've tried and I can say now that I gave up too easily! My meal was done in 3 minutes and was $8 for 2 tacos and a bottle of water. I got a chicken and a spicy beef. The chicken was pretty good. I'm more of a beef or pork taco girl though. So the spicy beef was my favorite! And really the tortillas were the best part! Fresh, toothsome a grilled perfectly! Some people do not know how important good corn tortillas are! The tacos were really full too! AND because they used the above mentioned quality tortillas, they were formidable enough to handle the filling!I loved everything! I kind of messed up though! They have specials and there was a chicken taco with a blueberry slaw that i should have opted for! Overall though, loved it and it is a great, cheap option outside of pizza and gyros (lesvos and benny fierro's forever!) when you need something quick and filling!"
"5.0","A great little undiscovered place that is frequented by locals and people like us that are always looking to find unusual little places to go to.... And Caffe La Mona  is certainly that! My daughter took me for birthday brunch and even though the menu is not as large as during the week, there were a lot of choices on the menu  Everything was fresh, tastefully prepared and presented. The service was great( not sure where everybody's coming from with complaints of slow or non-existent service, not this day) . For sure we will be returning there!!"
"4.0","One of the best Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh. Delicious food and friendly service at a reasonable price."
"2.0","Great pizza wait for it......when your near broke or drunk or both. And it is open late on weekends, always a plus."
"4.0","After a few hours of hard work and productivity at Espresso A Mano, we walked a couple blocks to grab a bite to eat. It was pretty slow and empty at the time around 1pm in the afternoon on a Tuesday. I have to say that my favorite thing about this place was 'The Toilet Paper' on the bathroom stalls. It's a one-page newsletter of happenings and facts pertaining to the restaurant. So while you're doing your business, you can read. I ordered the burger slide with chili cheese fries and my friend the Shadyside burger with cheese fries. We both enjoyed our meals. My chili cheese fries kind of overtook my plate. The cheese and chili are rather thin and therefore flood the plate. Nonetheless, very good and flavorful along with the burger. I built my own little burger and very much enjoyed it. I can't say that I wouldn't or won't come back, but I won't be in a hurry."
"3.0","This is my first experience and it was just okay. I ordered the Tex Mex Burrito and the cashier asked if i wanted a protein so I got steak, the add on cost $3.49 was cold and chewy (I should also mention that the burrito cost $7.49). My visit was later in the day, I understand it hasn't been busy in here but the meal overall was barely warm. Maybe it is supposed to be served like that? I'm not sure. But with the price of a protein being almost half of what I paid for the burrito, I think I will either try something completely different next time I come.Also, they sell can pop and there is no where for you to recycle the cans."
"4.0","Came here for dinner on a Sunday around 7pm. It was packed!!! It was quick to order and we were able to find a table. They give you a buzzer and you set it on a locator on your table. I thought that was neat. I ordered the chicken salad (no heat) and a side of fresh fruit. My husband ordered the chicken and waffles (also no heat). My salad was huge and really good. The chicken was not chewy at all. My husband said his was good but not enough chicken for the portion of waffle. I would definitely come back and try another item. I liked that the menu was limited. It's stressful when there are too many items to choose from."
"4.0","As the saying goes, ' Salem's is owned by Arabs, employs Bengalis, serves Indian Food and advertises itself as a Mediterranean restaurant. All jokes aside, this is a good place, with an excellent location and a very busy, diverse flow of customers. One thing I will point out is the serving size. I wish they used measuring cups or spoons for specific servings per meal. They lack the consistency of serving portions and it's varies by worker. One will give you two scoops of rice while another will give you 3. One will give you 4 big spoons of meat while another may only give you 2. There should be uniformity when it comes to serving portions. It sucks because the amount of food you get is wholly dependent on the mood or the carelessness of the worker who fills up your container. Also the menu items are getting old, wish they introduced different items. Plus, no one serves actual curry anywhere in this country because actual curry will make your taste buds tingle and 'Uranus' will later pay for it but your brain will keep forcing you to eat it. Why? The magic is in the spice not the food itself."
"2.0","We would have given this four stars, but we had a terrible customer service experience. We were seated right away on Friday night. The beer list was great, and we ordered two beers that were very tasty. A little too much time passed before our server asked about our food order. We asked about the cheese plate, and our server seemed only slightly knowledgeable. We ordered it anyway ($22), and also ordered the mushroom risotto and octopus. The mushroom risotto was excellent, and the octopus was very good. The cheese plate was also good, except there wasn't enough bread. This is where the bad customer service came in. We asked for more bread, the server told us it would be $5. We balked, and said 'we've ordered cheese all over the world and have never been charged for more bread. We want to talk to a manager.' Our server went away for a while and came back and said, 'my mistake, it's $3'. We said, 'how about $1', he said he would get a manager. Some woman came over, although she didn't identify her job title. We asked for more bread, gratis. She said, '$3'. We suggested that she sell us the bread for the reasonable price of $1, or else she should suggest something else to make us satisfied. She had no suggestions. She said she would talk to the chef, and that she didn't have the right 'pull'. We said, 'we want to talk to someone with pull.' At this point, our check was around $100. They really wanted that $3 more than for us to have a positive experience, I guess. After several minutes, 'Chris' came by, who seemed to have the necessary 'pull' to get us our darn bread we needed to finish eating our $22 cheese. However, rather than try to make us satisfied customers, he acted defensive.Note to restauranteurs: if folks on $100 checks want bread to enjoy their cheese, don't try to squeeze $3 out of them. A satisfied customer is worth much more than that. We will not be back."
"4.0","There aren't many options but what they have is: GOOD! Each time I've gone here, I get the chicken tenders. The first time was at Medium and while I had been warned, they were a little too hot for me. The next time I went, I got Mild and it was nice to be able to taste the flavoring of the batter along with some spice. In my opinion, anything higher than Medium, you only got spice and no flavor. The chicken is white meat and tastes fresh. The sauce they give you is delicious; in fact, I can't eat the chicken without it! They do a have bar here if you're looking for some alcohol or beer which is definitely different from other places in Oakland. It has less of a bar vibe and more of fast good vibe.Aside from the food and drinks, the vibe in here is super chill and young. Hip-hop was playing each time I went in. As you can imagine, this is a spot for college students. There's lower level seating as well as seating upstairs. If you look on the walls, there are not only outlets, but outlets with USB ports. Simple and genius, ya'll. They know who they're trying to attract, and I'm a fan!"

"1.0","The food is good, but the service was awful!! Michele the manager became frustrated with me while I was placing my order because the restaurant was short staffed!! I could've believe that I was being spoken to with such disrespect when all I wanted to do was place an order.. Never again will I spend my hard earned money here, neither should anyone else.."
"5.0","been here twice.  Hands down the best burger in PGH and it absolutely blows away you know who.  Might even be the best burger I have ever had.  Staff was friendly.  Beer is pretty good."
"5.0","My wife and I have been trying to get here for several months now and finally made our way over on a spontaneous walk. Situated right off Grant and 3rd, it nicely tucked away and has a parking lot to the side for those driving. Once inside the lights are low and it felt peaceful and inviting. Definitely not the hole-in-the-wall I was expecting to find. We were promptly seated in a booth in the adjacent room and provided water (we didn't want tea). The menu is both extensive and interesting. My wife opted for Honey Sesame Chicken with fried rice and I got the Ma Po Tofu with steamed rice. While we waited for our entrees we were given fried wonton wrappers and a sweet (maybe chutney?) and horseradish sauce. These weren't the highlight of the meal, but were nice to munch on. The meals came out piping hot and with more than enough for 4 people to share. The portions are very large but everything was fresh and flavorful. The Ma Po Tofu wasn't what I expected given I've had this in Hong Kong a number of times, but I liked the soupiness and it had some pickled vegetables much like a hot and sour soup does. My wife's meal was very tasty as well--I liked it better than my own and the fried rice was just like I remembered it from my time in HK. Way more authentic than fried rices you will get at other Chinese places. All around a really good meal with plenty of leftovers for the days to come. Definitely coming back :)"
"1.0","The food wasn't for me. But the place Looks nice and decent and the food quality is ok. But the taste could be better in my opinion."
"5.0","I love this place.  They have the best Chicken Tikka Masala.  All of their foods are great and as well as the customer service.  The portions in the cafe are HUGE and cheap. They have tons of awesome products in the grocery store.  We love Salems."
"1.0","Hours said open until 9. I walked in at 730 and the woman working stopped helping the customers in front of her and yelled at me from behind the counter that she was NOT going to serve me because they were closed. At that point, I said that's fine and walked out because I was at a loss of how to react. The rudeness and lack of professionalism by the employee was very unfortunate because I had stopped in before and their product is pretty good. I'm thankful that I was turned away because I would not want to be served by someone with that kind of attitude anyway."
"4.0","Pretty good sea food restaurant,especially for pittsburgh which is kinda far away from the sea/lake.I'd like oysters there go with horseradish sauce! And my entree is the seamen,with crab on the top,quite tender and juicy, very tasty!!!****Don't forget to do yelp check in and u can get a free appetizer!!The dim light there makes me feel a little uncomfortable,but it's not a big deal."
"5.0","We went with three other couples on a Saturday night and were seated in the cozy upstairs area.  Jonah was our enthusiastic waiter, and he did a terrific job explaining our options, opening our BYOB wines, and paying us just enough attention to make us feel welcome throughout the evening.  We shared the sausage bites, Bosc pear salad, cauliflower balls and squash ravioli appetizers and all were very good, especially the pear dish with a perfectly ripe pear over baby spinach with bacon pieces and soft cheese.  I had the delicious rainbow trout stuffed with crabmeat and shrimp over quinoa special and it was outstandingly prepared and beautifully presented.  We finished with coffee and four terrific desserts; two kinds of Creme br√ªl√©e (coconut & pumpkin), cheesecake and flourless chocolate cake that was out of this world!  We will definitely go back!"
"1.0","I used to work near Alexander's 10 years ago and it was consistently good,  so we decided to go there on Valentine's Day for a nice meal. As it turned out, the service and meals were a disaster. In fact, I have not seen service that bad in years. We ordered the 'make your own pasta' and the meals were unlike anything I have ever seen from an Italian restaurant. Not only were the dishes not correctly prepared based on the order, but bland and something you might see from a frozen microwave dinner. The waitress and general manager were lost with how to make things right. They were fumbling idiots who made no effort to suggest or substitute the meals. I was not impressed with the management and staff. We literally scavenged what we could from our meals, paid the check and got out of there. How many times have I left an Italian restaurant hungry? 2-14-2011 was the first time. Beware of this place, its not the same as it was back a few years ago."
"4.0","Delicious food (I recommend the Chang Mai noodles) and the friendliest staff. Huge portions too!"
"4.0","This is a solid seafood place. Their seafood is fresh. My family and I went as a celebration of my brother being in town and seafood is usually the best neutral cuisine for us. I was quite impressed with the taste of everything but the four stars and not five is because of the service. Let me start with the food. We ordered 3 appetizers as there were 6 of us: one dozen oysters (east & west coast), calamari, and mussels. Each dish was fantastic. I could've eaten the oysters by myself. I didn't want to stop. I'm sad I only got 3 of them. They were extremely fresh and you could tell the difference in taste for either region. The calamari was fried but the breading was light and the calamari itself was not chewy at all - just as calamari should be. Lastly, the mussels were yummy! The light wine sauce it came in and the freshness of the mussels was such a great combo, even down to the bread, it was tasty. We really loved our apps. My gram got the lobster bisque and she said it was the best she ever had. Next, our entrees. I ended up with the grilled swordfish. My whole dish was so lovely. However, I asked to sub my potatoes with a salad and apparently our waiter or the cook staff didn't do that and I got potatoes and my salad but no asparagus. I had to ask for it and I'm glad I did because they were out of this world. I've never had asparagus that good! On top of my swordfish was lump crab and they give you plenty. It was really just super flavorful and I really enjoyed it. It seemed like everyone enjoyed their dishes except my brother who thought the salmon dish was a bit bland, especially the kale. It's not a lot of food with that dish. But my other brother loved his seafood pasta and so did my dad. My mom also loved the cod and my gram loved her crab cakes. I also got a dessert because my brother mentioned it was my birthday (which it is soon lol) and we ordered the flourless chocolate tort cake and it was great! Not too sweet and pretty tasty. Ok. So the service. When we arrived, we were a little early for our reservation but they sat us anyway. The people that worked there did not seem friendly at all. At one point one of the waiters needed to come by us and he would've knocked us all over if they didn't move out of the way. He didn't even say excuse me or acknowledge us at all. After we were sat we had to wait at least 15 minutes before our waiter even came to get our drink orders. Although he was really nice, he was pretty slow and it wasn't even busy until we got our main dishes. He forgot a lot of things we needed, too. But it is what it is. Still great food, regardless!"
"5.0","Came here after Pirates game late on a Friday night. We had an awesome waiter, George who was so fun to talk to. He hit home run on all suggestions to our family from the 'game day' drink, pan fried chicken, street tacos to beer selection. We ended up here because another 'burger' place close by closed their kitchen early. So glad we ended up here instead. Ask for George, if he's there,  all around great guy who represents JBG36 very well!  My kids, teenagers, even mentioned that they wish other people enjoyed their jobs like George seemed to. When teen age boys notice that, it's something special"
"5.0","Simply FANTASTIC! The staff is knowledgeable, friendly and funny. Please try the oysters, salmon, and swordfish. Luke is incredibly friendly and approachable. An absolute must visit!"
"1.0","So I had read the reviews which said there were flies and I still decided to go here because my friend insisted I should not believe the negative reviews. Unfortunately, those were true.There were flies flying around and it was irritating. That was still ok because the food served was pathetic. I ordered a Gobi Manchurian which was average, chicken chettinadu which was overloaded with black pepper. It was not like I have never had these dishes before anywhere so I know how it tastes. The server while taking the order did not ask for the spice level and assumed that we would love very spicy food. All in all it was a bad experience.My friend too did not like his signature biryani since it was very very spicy.Both of us got very bad stomach aches after eating here. I have been to the Greentree one and that one is excellent. This one is just pathetic."
"5.0","Absolutely amazing and authentic tacos! I'm from South Florida and new to Pittsburgh. I have finally found amazing tacos that curb my craving."
"4.0","$3 even for any taco on the menu, including specials.  I enjoyed the chicken and carnitas! Fast service, laidback, sit at counter facing street windows and watch the people go by... would be great place to duck into on a cold night after a show.  Open until 3:00am on fri/sat."
"4.0","DoceTaqueria was better than I expected. In fact, it was a lot better than I expected.That being said, they don't make their own tortillas. That's an auto no.The good is the pork is absolutely amazing. Don't worry they counter it with a sub-par chicken taco that the chicken is flavorless and just blah.One critical part about Mexican cooking is the tortilla. I have been to so many Pittsburgh Mexican restaurants that miss so hard on the tortilla it destroys the dish.Imagine having a sandwich with white store sandwich bread vs homemade. World of difference, right?I only did try their chicken and pork. I'm told the beef is also solid and the chicken wasn't a good choice.If you take just the pork taco and you give them a little room on the tortilla it's so far one of my favorite tacos in Pittsburgh.The atmosphere screams hipster with the hole in the wall, counter service and little seating. It's a very cozy restaurant and I look forward to trying more options and visiting the new location up North when it opens."
"3.0","I ordered take out from here again, and this time instead of the 1-10 scale, the choices were mild, medium, hot, very hot, and Indian hot.  I would normally go for medium but after my last experience where a 7/10 was super mild I went for the hot, but my paneer sag came out with an obvious red tinge instead of a predominantly green color and it was so spicy I could barely eat it, and I love spicy food! I actually couldn't finish it since it was starting to bother my stomach which normally never happens to me when I eat spicy food. It had to be at least a 'very hot' if not an 'Indian hot' level.  I normally eat a 7 or 8 out of 10 on the spicy scale at other Indian restaurants but this was definitely higher. And it wasn't balanced well since the spice just overpowered all the other flavors so it was all I could taste. The food is generally good, and the service is prompt, but I wish they would get more consistent with their spice levels."
"4.0","This just opened and it's a hip cool burgher joint on the main street in artsy Lawrenceville district.It's got different levels of seating and a bar.They have mostly those grass fed beef, locally sourced fresh meat.... WHATEVER burgers, some chicken and hot dogs.I ordered the Pitts Burgher which had pickle, slaw, basil, special sauce and fries. I loved it.My fries had salt and pepper on them. The salty fries were perfect with my burger.I decided to order their salty dog with avocado, cream cheese, bacon and spices on a bagel bun. Unbeknownst to me they give you TWO of them!The food here is good and fresh and heavily seasoned usually with a salty kick. Would love to stop back again!"
"2.0","They were about to close in like 15 - 30 mins when we arrived. We got the slice of pepperoni pizza. It was overwhelming greasy, I didn't even want to eat the rest of the pizza. I know pizza is suppose to be a little bit greasy, but this was just horrible. I felt like I dipped myself in grease after having a few bites of the pizza."
"5.0","Stopped in for breakfast one weekday when they were just opening and we had the place to ourselves. Everyone who works there is super friendly! You order at the counter and then seat yourself, but they bring the food out to you. I had the lox platter and it was very good - the smoked salmon was fresh and they gave plenty of toppings. Well worth the price! Will definitely be back again."
"5.0","Great atmosphere, food was so delicious with generous portions. Pan fried noodles were simply amazing."
"4.0","I ordered goat vindaloo garlic naan n mango lassi,I was pretty happy with my order,goat was well cooked and tasted nice. They take their spice level pretty seriously so be careful,I got level 6 and it was pretty spicy. Mango lassi was great, n my dish came with rice. Delivery was very fast as well. I just wished few more goat pieces in there."
"4.0","Mushroom cheesesteak with a Stewart's root beer for lunch today. Freshly made, toasted bun, all good! Friendly service."
"4.0","Wow this was good.A group of 6 of us went last night (showing up with our own case of beer).We essentially ordered enough varied entrees for the table to create our own buffet.I don't have a refined Indian food palate - so I usually stick to the safe stuff.  BUT I will tell you the Chicken tika masala was one of the best that I've ever had.  Plates were licked clean, the sauce was so amazing!  The Vindaloo was also great, we ordered it super spicy and it delivered.Saag Paneer was better than most places as well - very rich and delicious.I really enjoyed that this was in an old house converted to a restaurant.  Many of the Indian places in pittsburgh don't pay much attention to ambiance or setting.  Tamarind gives it a little more attention.(apologies if I've butchered the spelling of any Indian dishes!)"
"5.0","I had never had Arepas (pronounced a-rape-as) or Venezuelan food at all until I moved across the street from this hidden gem. If you like chalupas, you will love Arepittas! The 'bun' is kind of a fried corn pancake that is split like an English muffin. The fillings are so savory and delicious you can't go wrong. I have to hold myself back from eating these every day, they are so good! The owner is super friendly and remembers your name. He even called me by name when we randomly saw one another on the street! If you are in the neighborhood before their 4:00 pm closing time, be sure to give this place a try."
"3.0","Very awesome atmosphere. Only downfall is NO HAPPY HOUR. It is a bit pricey that is for sure. But you are paying for the atmosphere. Their cheapest beer is 5.50$ and ranges to 9$. I just wish they had a happy hour!"
"3.0","I had high hopes for the Cafe at Phipps because I had heard a lot of great thins about it.  I am wondering if it was 'good' just because of local ingredients and no 'bad for you' food rather then actually being a place people loved for the taste and service.We arrived shortly before 2:00 on a Sunday.  Apparently at 2:00, you can no longer order anything from the menu other than the pizzas.  This meant the selections were limited to prepackaged salads, sandwiches and soups.  I was disappointed because there were several sandwiches I was trying to decide between.  There was nothing on the website or in writing at the cafe that showed there was a limited menu at a certain point.  I might expect that if you come in at 4 (when Phipps closes at 5) that they would limit it, but why three hours before closing time?  Beverage choices are limited to the 'Pittsburgh Seltzer' or a coffee bar.  The options sounded great - various fruit flavors such as orange and pineapple mixed with seltzer water. However, the day we were there they were out of seltzer, so for the same price, we got very minimally flavored tap water.  I chose the orange pineapple and I'm sure it would have been better with the seltzer and right amount of flavor.  However, there was very little juice added so it lacked flavor.  I drank it anyway, but I heard at least two people go back up and ask for more juice to be added.  I chose the grilled chicken and poached pear salad.  It was served with greens, cucumbers, tomatoes and of course, pears.  It had a pear vinaigrette dressing.  I enjoyed the salad, but it was nothing special, especially for the $9 price tag.  I was glad I don't eat tomatoes, because the ones in my salad were soggy and limp.  It did make me wonder how long the pre made salad had been sitting in the cooler.  My husband ordered the Margherita pizza.  He enjoyed it, but said the dough was grainy and wished there was more cheese.  I also tried the carrot soup.  It was good but certainly not the best I've ever had.  It was a large portion size which was nice.  Overall, not a bad experience, but I expected more, especially for the price."
"2.0","I REALLY wanted to like this place! The menu looked great, we liked the vibe and both shrimp appetizers were really good. The drink menu looked fun and inventive  BUT then the entrees arrived.... my husbands had the most potential. The halibut could have been lovely if not for being dry as a bone with bland flavoring and no sauce that could have helped the dryness. My salmon was just bad and sad  the crab on top was actually ok but the sauce was an odd mix of mismatched flavors and the salmon was so over cooked it could have been served as a hockey puck!! I might try again but would stick to apps and drinks."
"3.0","The Phips Cafe is decent. They have options for soups, sandwiches, and even some homey foods. Unfortunately, the quality of the food is to be desired. Most of the time I get soggy wraps or greasy sandwiches and I am pretty sure I can get that anywhere else in oakland for half the price. I gave them 3 stars because they claim most of their foods are organic but  overall the quality/price index is very low."
"5.0","Had an amazing brunch here with my sister 2 weekends ago. I ordered the veggie omelette and it was absolutely incredible. The portion is just as big as brunch on a Sunday should be, and was served with 2 slices of buttered toast and great mashed home fries. The service was super speedy! We had our meal within about 2 minutes from ordering. Still we never felt rushed. All around fantastic meal."
"3.0","I came here for Saturday brunch in a group of 7. We reserved ahead of time and when we came in our table was ready for us. There's quite a lot of indoor seating and a really nice outdoor patio with additional seating as well. We ordered omelettes, Nutella banana French toast, and a salad. The food was pretty much as expected and the prices were reasonable.Our only issue with the place was that the service was not great. Our server seemed very impatient in taking our order and tried to take away plates before we were done eating multiple times. When we received the receipt, we realized we were charged for water, which we didn't order. We explained to our server that the water was already set up for us on the table when we walked in and we didn't realize it was not free. She told us well it's only $0.50 per person but that we don't have to pay for it if we don't want to."
"3.0","Ordered the Family special: really like the plain cheese pizza, the hoagies are decent, but huge. That's a chicken ranchero. Nothing special, but better than other local delivery places. Wings were okay, but not very saucy. And the extra breadsticks are a nice, free touch! The super late delivery is also a perk!"
"5.0","Celebrated a birthday last week up in the Cinderlands 'loft'  a fun and open area for a smaller (think 10 or less) group. We had great beer, food and service. Started with appetizers and then  ordered the dinner special, Lamb Shoulder with rice-tender and so tasty! Grace, our server was excellent, knowledgeable about the beers and what would complement each dish. Will be back for brunch, the menu looks great!"
"5.0","I love this place. I have always liked the drinks. I tried the beet salad and it was the best I've had."
"5.0","I love this place! It's a restaurant, buffet (during Ramadan), and middle eastern grocery store. The restaurant is cafeteria style lots of tables close together with a lunch counter holding hot dishes like curry chicken and lamb with veggie and vegan options. They also have grilled meats like lamb and chicken cooked to order. Gyros, burgers, kebab this place has everything. Middle eastern desert like baklava are also available. The portions are large and the price is fair.The Ramadan buffet is a special treat. Nightly during Ramadan from around 8 to around 10 they have a eat in or take out buffet. It's usually around 15 bucks.The grocery is filled with spices, produce and teas. Great deals can be found. The wealth of uniqe and different ingredients is astounding. They have a halal butcher and will mix and preseason meat for you. I strongly suggest the spiced meat mix called kufta. They have different drinks and candy and fresh pita. Go for lunch, shop the grocery, come back for a Ramadan buffet. You're welcome."
"5.0","When it comes to Thai food, I'm pretty boring. Nine times out of ten at a Thai restaurant, I'll order the same thing -- prik khing chicken. It's a fairly basic chicken with veggie dish, but the sauce is really what makes it sing. So I judge all Thai restaurants by how well they make this dish. And Thai Gourmet wins. The veggies are cooked to a crisp perfection, they are generous with the chicken, and the sauce is super flavorful and spicy without being too oily -- just how I like it.Speaking of spicy, another reason that I like this place is that they aren't afraid to use a real 1-10 spicy scale instead of the 'wimpy person' spicy scale. I've been to other Thai restaurants (I'm looking at you, Thai Place) where I'd order a 10 and it would barely tickle my tongue. Not so with Thai Gourmet! They mean business with their spice. I can handle my heat, and for me a 7 to 8 on their scale really gets the ol' sweat glands going. And I love that!Lastly, the portions at this place are HUGE. A dinner order of the prik khing chicken (or pad thai or anything else there) is easily enough for two meals. And considering that the entrees are reasonably priced (around $10-13 bucks for dinner), I think this is a great value. Also, when you get your food to take out, they sometimes include a little dessert for free (brownie or tapioca pudding).The only thing I don't like about this place is that you can't sub brown rice for white. This is one of the only Thai places I've been to that doesn't serve brown rice. So much for trying to add a little fiber to my meal. Ah well, still delicious and still 5 stars!"
"5.0","Doce Taqueria definitely serves up the best tacos around. They are meticulously crafted with a myriad of ingredients that flow together perfectly. They aren't your run of the mill ground beef, lettuce and cheese (though they do have their own take on that-if that's your thing).Their tacos are a small and sold individually so if you're not that hungry you can just grab one for $3, but my husband and I usually stick with three a piece. Its cheap and filling. Perfect for grabbing a quick (and sublime) bite.Quick being the operative word. You must either grab and go, or plan on woofing it down at their very limited bar seating. This very limited seating, however, in no way takes away from the dining experience. It actually benefits them, and you. It makes the whole experience a certain aesthetic and event, all the while forcing the masses attempting to consume tacos through the line with precision and speed.I have tried every single taco option they have, and they are all excellent. I have, however, for my tastes, narrowed it down to an ordering formula. I always get the special, the pollo and the carnitas- all on CORN tortillas (that is KEY). With absolute modesty, I can say, it is perfection.Seriously, if you are looking for tacos and are into well crafted 'foodie' food. Look no further. Eat here. Trust me."
"5.0","Went to this place with my colleagues as were in town for work. We had to drive around twice to get the valet parking as the place was packed. This was sign that a right place was picked for dinner.Food- We were eight people so ordered a lot of items from each section so get ready to read a long review! Appetizers:Pan fried Calamari with hot cherry peppers- As the name suggests it was hot. It was not too crispy and little on the softer side. But the flavor and taste was really good. I would give it 4/5 because I like calamari a little crispy. There is no sauce that comes with it so if you want one,you need to ask. A few of my co-workers could not handle the spice so if you don't eat medium spicy,this is not for you!Pork belly with tomato jam- the portion was really small like really small which was good I think as the dish was not too good in taste. It tasted soggy and the tomato jam was overpowering the bacon taste. I would not recommend it personally.Truffle fries- I would say that this was my favorite out of all the appetizers! A must try! The portions are not too bad either and good enough to share with 2-3 people.Brussels sprouts with bacon- Perfect amount of oil and flavor. Nothing too fancy or unique, if you don't want anything else then sure go for it otherwise there are better options like the fries!They also serve various kinds of breads which also fills you up so decide your appetizers accordingly.Main course: I do not eat steak so I decided to go with Chilean sea bass with mushroom soy broth- it was good, the broth had a nice aroma and was tasting perfect with the fish! So if you like something with not too much spices, do not eat steak and want something very neutral in taste and easy to finish then I would recommend this.My co-workers ordered steak but they had one comment in common that even medium rare was overdone which reduced the juice and flavor. I have no comments on that as I know nothing about steak!Sides:- Lobster Mac and cheese- The lobster comes in giant pieces mixed in Mac and cheese. I was expecting very small pieces mixed well in Mac and cheese but that was not the case. The taste was good, top was crispy, and it's Mac and cheese (I don't know what else to say). Definitely recommended!- Mashed potatoes - it made a good side for people who ordered steak as Steak does not come with any side. It was good and definitely worth getting if you are getting steak.- Asparagus - I thought it was very oily so I couldn't eat more than one bite. I could taste the oil. Dessert:- New York cheese cake - We ordered that because they had no more Creme Br√ªl√©e but the top part tasted exactly the same. 4/5- Warm Double chocolate cake- it's chocolate lava cake with ice cream on the side. I love chocolate so I would say that this was my fav dessert! 5/5- Fruit sorbet - I did not like it much, found it too tangy but I guess it's because I am not a sorbet fan. But there are better options in my opinion so why go for this!- Trio of handcrafted ice creams- This does not come with 'cookies' as the description says! There was this one biscotti looking cookie that is very hard to break and three ice creams with one scoop each. Drinks- They have a good wine list! I got the Cabernet - 'Frank' , liked it! Overall comments - The service was great, ambience was really good, good music in the background , our server was very attentive and very honest about the recommendations. I would definitely recommend it as a good place for a special occasion, date night, or work lunches/dinners. It is definitely pricey but the service, food, ambience is equal to the price. Sorry, I only have 2 pictures to share - My main course and the chocolate dessert! Cheers and live,laugh and love!"
"4.0","Got bored of eating outside food and felt like having simple Indian food. Was Staying at hotel so decided to try dal fry and rice from tamarind. Dal fry had a lot of veggies like beans, carrots etc and was very good. They do give a side or vegetables/dal and rice with it. I opted for vegetables and got cabbage which was okish. Ordered raita and was good too."
"5.0","My husband and I just moved here and he passes this place everyday on his way home from work. So tonight we decided to have a pizza and baseball night. Omg it was the best pizza we have had here in Pittsburgh. We've tried all the 'best/top' places and omg Rialto's was incredible. Highly recommended!!!  Coming from An Italian !"
"5.0","Pleasantly surprised. 5 stars for exceeding my expectations. I went earlier in the week for dinner and it was kind of dead with only 2 other customers. I'm horrible when given too many choices so I got the Chop Shop with added olives and jalape√±os on a regular flatbread. The pizza was very flavorful and very filling for a flatbread. Will go again not only out of convenience (2 min walk) but because I love pizza and this is better, and less caloric, than most of the chains in pgh."

"4.0","This was my second time here using the Groupon and it is the best deal EVER! I tried the chicken curry, the tikka masala, and the saag here and they all come with such flavorful sauces and tender chicken. But last time I came the tikka masala was not as tender because it felt like it was taken from the buffet tray. I also got the prince naan, which is naan with garlic, onion, and cilantro, and is a must when you're here!"
"5.0","Stopped in here for lunch on a Tuesday; the place was packed.... On a Tuesday!!! I'd have to agree with everyone else on here. The service is quick and friendly, the atmosphere is cozy, the egg rolls are the best around and the Tomato Chile Chicken that I got was yummy (although I wouldn't quite characterize it as 'spicy' like the menu implied). With my total bill coming to $8.50 plus tip, I'd put the Chinatown Inn in the 'great value' column."
"5.0","I LOVE this restaurant. The food is amazing and everyone who works there is great! My favorite dish is the mattar paneer and of course a side order of garlic naan. They also have a delicious mango smoothie-type beverage."
"5.0","First time I came here today, surprised they are open on 4th of July. and I asked myself that how did I miss this amazing breakfast place for so long! They have great patio and awesome Atmosphere. Staff are so kind and helpful. I ordered veggie omelette and iced latte. Best omelette I ever had for so long. Fresh ingredients and big portion. Coffee was so good too. Definitely coming back"
"4.0","Pretty good! I'm a huge sucker for anything in a corn tortilla and these tacos definitely hit the spot.I had the daily special which was a BBQ chicken taco, the carnitas, and the carne molida. My favorite was the special, then the carne molida. Carnitas had a great texture and toppings but I thought the meat itself could have used a little more flavor. The only other thing I would have changed is I prefer fresh jalape√±o over pickled, but that's super minor. The price is right on these tacos for sure! Though I got them to go, the place is very cool inside and the staff is friendly. All in all, I ordered, watched my tacos be prepared, and was on my way in less than 10 minutes! I'm glad I don't live closer because it could be dangerous!"
"4.0","I walked into Arnold's today for the first time during my work lunch break. I was immediately taken wth the rustic decor and comfortable seating. The space is divided in two (without feeling separate). One side is the cafe where you order teas, lunch, small bites, etc. This side also has tables for dining. The other side boasts a comfy sofa with side chairs and tables. The tea selection is immense without being overwhelming. I absolutely love the ginger twisted tea (iced) and the BLT was yummy too. If you're a tea snob or casual tea drinker, this place serves your needs."
"2.0","As a passport carrying Italian I was excited to learn about this shop after first visiting her sister's grocery store just 12 places down the street. I walked in to fresh baking cookies in the air and noticed many things that i normally can't get at the regular grocer. Happily I went to the back to say hello and ask about what was in the oven. I was greeted by a women who was not the least bit friendly and told me that what I was smelling could be anything. She kept asking people, can I help you? Soon I realized that maybe the back of the store was off limites? There is a cookie counter with window back there, so it looks like it is just part of the store, but by her unfriendly insistance about what I wanted, I got the sense that I was not to be there. I asked to buy one of the peanut butter cookies that that had been making... thinking that I could eat it while browsing in the store... and she quickly responded,  'We only sell them by the half or full dozen.' By this time, I didn't feel very welcome or even that she was interested in selling me anything. I left, and don't intend to return."
"5.0","Came here with my friend who works up the street. I'm from out of town and she claimed this was a go to for a quick and good meal. There are menus on a counter upon entering. Since I didn't know what to get, I asked the staff what they recommended. They have an assortment of options and the combo meals are great for if you want to do a 'one of each' thing. I got an empanada and an arepa, both were delicious. They ask if you want any sauce once they bring you your food. I got the avocado one which was fabulous. The only things I didn't like was they don't have a restroom, and they should maybe have sauces out for customers to grab as they like, if so I would have sampled a few or got the amount I wanted (their containers were small). Overall, great spot!"
"4.0","I really like the vibe of this place.  It's on the 3rd floor of a building and there is no elevator so be prepared for a minor workout getting here.  The server was very attentive and the food was good.  They offer daily specials and also have a happy hour menu.  I enjoyed the Nigiri and the special roll with Alligator meat.  I was expecting it to be tough but it was very tender which was a nice surprise. I can see this place being a great date spot or just a place to stop by solo for drinks and dinner."
"3.0","Next to our hotel, and we found driving around Pittsburgh fairly confusing the first night so we ended up back here before hanger turned to meltdowns. It was okay. Like a bargain Denny's?? Kids liked their meals but they're pretty easy to please. I honestly would have enjoyed a quarter pounder combo from McD's more than my SuperBurger without special sauce (tartar sauce- shudder). Fries undercooked, bun in middle of two parties turned to bread-mush. Actual patties were tasty and cooked well. But really, sub-par fries at a diner chain?? Just not really acceptable. The salad bar looked fresh, it just didn't have a ton of items. It was an acceptable family stop."
"3.0","I went here to watch the Pitt Panthers bowl game this past weekend. It looks very fancy, typical of a restaurant in a casino. The ambiance was modern and cool. It's very big and there's plenty of tables there. There's even a VIP section. The food left something to be desired though. It's typical bar food. Absolutely nothing special about their food at all. I did enjoy their drink specials though. I've heard they always have nice drink specials so that's a definitely a plus. All in all, it's somewhere that I'd go to again, depending on the drink specials but I will not eat there expecting a meal to match the ambiance."
"5.0","Repeat visitor to the Strip District, but the first trip for my wife.  She wanted to eat at Pamela's Diner, despite my feedback that it was routine diner food, especially if you try to avoid gluten and therefore don't want to partake of their signature crepe-style pancake.  Anyway, we learned the wait for Pamela's on a Sunday morning was an expected 45 minutes ... not wanting to lose that much time, we walked around the corner to Cafe Raymond, and I was SO happy we did.  Pro's: 1) less than a 5 minute wait; 2) cold brew coffee was delicious; 3) execution of my omelet was top-notch; without the considerable grease of a diner.  Con's: onions were advertised as 'sauteed', but they were basically raw.  I like the former; dislike the latter, but wasn't that hard to pick them off.  Next time I'll skip them."
"4.0","The restaurant has a very approachable feel. Nice alternative to other places in Lawrenceville. Decor is well done and atmosphere is very casual.  Good burgers and food was fairly priced. No complaints about service. I would return."
"1.0","Are. You. Joking???Setting: with the Walmart dishes and top 40 hits playing with the weird old lady apartment deco.. Not a great vibe.Service: had to ask for literally everything! Having been a server for several years (in an Italian restaurant!) I get how things work and if a waiter is 'in the weeds.' However we arrived at 5pm on a Thursday and the place was dead! Had to ask for more water, bread, the check, boxes, - several times because she kept forgetting. She was too busy sitting at the bar talking with the other employees. Food: gross, gross, gross! My angel hair pasta was a bowl of soup! I have never had such crappy sauce! Price: I think this is what has me so pissed. Crappy atmosphere, horrible service - and then you charge me $70 bucks for:-1 soda $3-1 salad $7-1 appetizers $10-2 pasta dishes $50!?!? WTH!? I don't mind paying good money for good service, and food. However, for crappy EVERYTHING I could've gone to Olive Garden and paid half and it still would've been better.Came here on a recommendation from a work colleague... Won't be back - EVER."
"5.0","We went for restaurant week with a couple friends since we have never been here before and we're pleasantly surprised! They have valet service offered at $8 after 6pm during the week, not sure during the weekend. The food was amazing also. Got a field salad with Parmesan vinegar dressing that was amazing then a 14oz Bone in NY Strip that was cooked to perfection. The mash potatoes and green beans were also good. It was a casual, elegant setting in a very high end restaurant. The staff was very friendly also."
"5.0","When I first moved to Pittsburgh 6 years ago, one thing I found lacking was good Mexican food/tacos. Well that's all changed in a few short years. For me the only place that rivals Edgar's is Doce taqueria in the South Side and Edgar's is significantly cheaper, so I guess that makes them the winners. Great, hearty, simple tacos that hit all the right notes. Will definitely be back regularly!"
"5.0","So simple, yet so good. Simple is not bad yinz guyz... prime example here! Five different tacos to choose from and a handful of sides. I tried the carnitas and carne molida and both were fantastic. You also get the choice of a flour or corn tortilla... which I'm sure you authentic Mexican food seekers will like! Just thinking about them makes me hungry! I probably could have done one more if I didn't order up a side of black beans. And it's not just black beans... it's black beans topped with cheese and salsa. I don't think you could squeeze in anything else in this shop because it's TINY! They have a bar to sit around for probably around 10ish people, so don't come here with a big group... unless you're taking your tacos to go! All tacos are $3 and sides $2 which is a TOTAL steal! If I was in the South Side everyday, this could become a problem (but is that a bad thing!?)!"
"5.0","Fantastic spot to relax with a cup of tea or coffee. Wide open high ceilings make a space feel light and airy. Wonderful service, nice selection."
"3.0","For a cafe attached to a museum/attraction, Cafe Phipps is like a 4.5, if not 5-star establishment.  In comparison to eateries in general, the food is fine but not outstanding.I love that the cafe uses local, in-season ingredients, and that it composts much of its waste.  Currently, it's one of two Pittsburgh eateries certified by the Green Restaurant Association.  Right now, the cafe has Friday happy hour, from 5-9 pm, which it calls 'Agave Nights,' in honor of the giant agave plant now at the conservatory.  $4 for margaritas, and $3 for beer, and popcorn shrimp or chicken nachos as food specials.  You can also order off their regular menu (which changes seasonally) up until 7 pm.  The falafel which is currently on the regular menu comes like a burger--as a single patty, on a bun.  The bun would have been better toasted.  I don't know how I felt about the blue cheese dressing on the patty, as opposed to a more traditional yogurt sauce or tahini sauce.  The cole slaw side was good in that the cabbage and carrot were fresh, but overall the slaw was too liquid-y and the random pieces of fruit (pineapple?) was rather strange.  I've also had a mushroom sandwich of some sort in the past here (not on the current menu), which was sort of bland.I wouldn't eat here unless I was also visiting the conservatory (which I really do recommend), but this is also one of the healthiest places to eat at in Oakland, and probably has the nicest atmosphere of all Oakland food places."
"2.0","Not a fan. Who just offers smoked turkey and not regular turkey? I then went for the roast beef American and they were out of cheese at 11:30 in the morning. They didn't ask if I wanted my bread toasted, but it came that way."
"5.0","I absolutely love coming here. The food is always fresh and full of flavor. Lamb Chops super affordable. The portions are huge and even when the line is long tour not waiting long. Best Goat Biryani I have had in a Long time. Coming here your guaranteed to have a over full belly at half the price."
"5.0","I live here so I come here frequently almost once a week. The cocktails are unique. Atmosphere is very low key. The best reason to visit is the cheese plate!! I come here at least once a week to get my cheese fix."
"5.0","Most amazing dinner!!! We had a cute and intimate table by the windows in the front of the building. Our waitress was so nice the entire time. We both got the crab legs. They were incredibly huuuge! Hands down the best crab legs we have ever had and we will be back! Highly recommend this restaurant. Great customer service and food."
"4.0","When you walk in to Tamarind, you feel like you're walking in to someone's house. The atmosphere is very comfortable and casual. I came here with a couple friends on a Friday night, and we got seated right away. We split 3 entrees between 3 people, and ordered a couple of samosas to start. The samosas were very good, but they tasted as if they had been frozen. The paneer tikka masala was amazing. The sauce was so delicious to dip the Naan into. The channa masala was great too. The Chettinadu vegetables were not my favorite, but they were OK. The service was great. Our waiter stayed on top of our water demand, and he was very nice and patient when we ordered. This is not the best Indian food I have ever had, or close to it, but it's a great local find. Tamarind fills the void if you're craving Indian food around Pitt and CMU, and the prices aren't too bad!"
"2.0","Service was wonderful. She was attentive and kind. However, it did not compensate for the laziness of the kitchen. My first batch of wings where served cold with an improperly made 'Giddy Up' sauce which is a flavor I have all the time.... The server kindly apologized and took the wings away. A few moments later we were handed back the same batch of wings that obviously had been microwaved do to how soggy the wings had become. (Still with that mystery white sauce). I bit into the wing and even with the microwaving, the wing was bloody and raw on the inside. The manager came over once and offered to get us something else. After the initial lack of effort put into our initial meal, I declined as did my friend who was also uncomfortable with the kitchen. I won't be back to this Red Beards. I will still however frequent the Mt Washington location where the kitchen cares about what comes out to the customer.  (This was not the first bad experience at this location, but it will now be the last.)"
"5.0","Let's start with the negatives. In reality there are none. You pay for what you get in this world and this definitely applies to Capital Grille. For my wife and I (neither of which drink alcohol) we spent $200 with tip. It was a special occasion, so I'm not complaining, but the cost can certainly be a limitation. Now for the positives, which are countless. The food is unmatched, the service is stellar, the place is absolutely spotless, classy, and not at all intimidating. I've only been once, but I can guarantee everything on the menu will send the average mortal into a fourth dimension. An absolute must try...even if it means a second mortgage. You'll thank me later."
"5.0","I came here once on a first date and have been hooked on the food ever since.  That first night, we ordered the Sushi Lover for two that came with a wide variety of sushi and rolls as well as Miso soup.  That was my first time trying out such a variety of sashimi style sushi, so it was really nice to have so many different types of pieces at the same time.  You get two six-piece rolls and two pieces of 8 different types of sushi so you and your dining partner can each have a taste of everything.As far as the atmosphere is concerned, this place has always been very quiet and the service has been pretty great.  It was a good choice for a first date (we didn't have to strain to hear each other as we talked).  The food does, however, take some time to prepare so if you are ravenous and in dire need of food ASAP, I wouldn't come here since you'll be waiting a while for the sushi.It is a bit more expensive than I'm used to, so I've resorted to using the Restaurant.com gift certificates; you can get $25 certificates for meals of  more than $35 on there pretty cheaply.  Buy them at the beginning of the month since they seem to sell out on Restaurant.com and all that is left are the $10 off ones for lunch.  I don't eat much in one sitting, so I tend to get one of the combo meals that has the teriyaki chicken.  That way I can eat the sushi and Miso soup at the restaurant, but can take the chicken home and reheat it; it reheats very well.  Love the homemade, low-sodium soy sauce!"
"2.0","If it isn't past midnight, don't come to Antoon's. A $4.90 large cheese pizza is great at 3 AM after a night of fun but there are much better pizza options during the day. It's a small establishment and it's carry out and cash only."
"5.0","After my horrible experience with ECCO shoes, I've been writing about my positive experiences.  Beautiful place to have lunch.  Shaded tables, great food and service.  Fabulous fountain.  Cool place to have lunch on a hot day.  Loved the summer minestrone & the best iced tea.  Wish it was in Richmond."
"2.0","In my opinion not so good...Huge portions just don't make up for so-so food in my book. I'm always disappointed"
"4.0","Had a nice time. Food was very good and Nick the Bartender was always there to replenish my Coors Light when I ran out. It was nice and cool inside the bar and my Dad and I enjoyed are time there. Give it a shot you'll have a good time."
"5.0","This bar is constantly receiving recognition in all of the local blogs and publications. And for good reason. All of their delightful cocktails are handcrafted from fresh ingredients right in front of you. The music selection, lighting, decor, ambiance and crowd-favorite board games bring such a great vibe. Everyone is always so calm, cool and collected here. The basement bathrooms were done by a local artist. Name-that-tune trivia is fantastic, as are the happy hour specials. The open-air garage door concept along Shiloh is ideal. The fall decorations are so tasteful and really pull you into the season. This is a fantastic spot run by fantastic people in a fantastic location. I love stopping by for happy hour or a late night cocktail. Well done, mes amis."
"5.0","Ok... this is my 3rd time eating here... Lord I hate that I have been in Pittsburgh for a month and had been eating some pretty crappy food! I have had the Grilled chicken flat bread 3 times and the stuffed cod to take with me. Forget about the cod... that grilled chicken flatbread though? ABSOLUTELY AWESOME! The flat bread is soft and fresh, grilled chicken is delicious and smokey then the cheese, lettuce, fresh salsa, grilled onions and peppers drizzled with chipotle sauce has blown my mind! I didn't think it could be that great so I have ordered it 3x and every single time it's has been consistently delicious. The staff is friendly and gives you that feeling like they know you, I watch different servers attend to different customers and they just had a really great vibe (except for 2, they looked tired as hell and a bit grumpy)! My server, Heather, was great! She told me what was good on the menu what was not, she was totally honest. I love an honest server, don't just say that something is popular or good just to say it. The food is inexpensive and the portions are great."
"5.0","Wooow amazing food and service. Such a diverse restaurant. All walks of life eat here which spoke loudly to me. Great portions! Will definitely be back."
"4.0","I had the pulled pork sandwich for lunch which was pretty good, more sweet than tangy and served on a sub roll. The sub roll it was served on was good and toppings were tasty.  I failed to order fries with my sandwich, I sort of thought they were included but I was wrong.  My bad, I failed.  The guy behind the counter realized this and threw me a box of fries for free, very cool.  The fries were really good, not typical pedestrian style fries.  These were really good fries. I will be back to this place and look forward to my next visit."
"4.0","My wife and I decided on cafe Raymond after we saw the huge lines for DeLuca's and Pamela's. You order in line like you would at a Panera bread and take your seat once you place your order. I was hungry and so I went for the muffaletta. My wife wanted to be healthy so she decided on the veggie wrap with a side salad and lemon vinaigrette. About 5 minutes after we placed our orders our food came out.My muffaletta was perfect, they prepared the sandwich on homemade focaccia bread. This was the perfect match for this great sandwich. Inside the bread were two different kinds of olive salads and an assortment of Italian meats and cheese. The best part of the sandwich though was the bread. I am from Philly and bread is huge and almost as important as the contents inside the sandwhich. Cafe Raymond takes pride in their food and you can tell in every bit.4/5 in my opinion. Will definitely be back."
"5.0","Incredible food pastries and coffee. Nice location. Nice employees. Going back for sure."
"3.0","I'm glad I was finally able to check this place out recently. A group of us stopped in on a Friday evening for dinner and drinks, and had no trouble getting a table quickly even though the restaurant was fairly busy. I love the large and open space, and the windows overlooking the street below. The garage doors were open and the space was nice and breezy. I started by splitting the eggplant involtini with a friend along with a delicious red blend. The dish was essentially a 'fancy' mozzarella stick with eggplant inside--and I mean that in a good way. The dish includes only two of the little rolls, so we probably could have ordered another appetizer along with it. My friend and I decided to also split a pizza, and we ordered the picante salami and peppers. The salami and banana peppers were delicious and perfectly spicy. I actually tasted some spice in the sauce as well--I'm a lover of spicy foods to no complaints here. We were quite hungry before dinner and had no trouble demolishing the whole pizza between the two of us, but you could probably get away with splitting it three ways if you are also having apps/other dishes.I'm only giving three stars because the service was bizarre. I appreciate when waiters and waitresses take the extra step to educate you about a restaurant, its menu, and what they have to offer; however, I felt like it was taken too far and the whole experience was condescending. It was sort of like being a child and having someone explain how to read a menu to you. Also, someone at my table had a nut allergy and asked about a possible accommodation--she was immediately told 'no' without any hesitation. Once pressed, he finally went to ask the kitchen and came back stating that it would be perfectly fine. I understand that some things are premade and cannot be changed, but this was a really basic request and the kitchen clearly had no problem with it. So why not go ask before aggressively telling us no accommodations can be made? On that same note, they give you small pieces of biscotti with your check (we loved this detail), but the waiter made an unnecessary comment that 'he didn't bring a piece for (the person with the allergy) because they contain nuts and he doesn't want her to die.' Thanks for remembering and giving a warning, but maybe next time try to tone down the passive-aggression.Overall the food and space were great. Service, well, I think we just were not so lucky that day. I will probably give it another try."
"5.0","Everything is fantastic here!! My mouth waters when I come in here...everything looks and tastes amazing! They give you huge portions, so come when you're hungry. The restaurant is cafeteria style- you stand in line to order, then you pick from a wide variety of dishes what you want to eat. It's crowded around 1:00-3:00, so come as early as you can. They also have a market next door so you can shop while waiting for your food. I recommend trying the chicken schwarma or get a little bit of everything. The saag paneer is one of my favorite veggie dishes they serve. The chicken biryani and lamb curry are good, too. Besides the food, the staff is great too. When you're shopping in the Strip and need a quick lunch, stop at Salem's! You won't be disappointed!"
"3.0","I am giving this restaurant 3 stars not because the food isn't good, because it is, but because for a fish place they should care more about the sea than they apparently do. We had glasses of water and cocktails, all came with plastic straws in them. When I asked the server about this she couldn't be bothered. I guess Wholey's didn't see the recent article on a pregnant whale who washed ashore with a belly full of plastics. If customers are the driving force behind straws in drinks then switch to paper."
"4.0","All you seafood lovers in Pittsburgh... Luke Wholey's is where it's at!!! After years of going to the strip district & eating at Roland's my boyfriend and I decided to check out Luke Wholey's for lunch instead a few years ago and were pleasantly surprised. Ever since then, I keep on coming back! The atmosphere at Luke Wholey's looks like something that would be at the beach! It is the perfect fun seafood ambiance. In the Summer, they open the doors to sit outside on the sidewalk as well- which I love! I've also never had bad service while eating at Wholey's. I've been here on dates with my boyfriend, nights out with my girlfriends, and even brunch on Sunday with my parents and have always enjoyed myself! Just about all of the food at Wholey's is fabulous. Some of my favorites include the lobster bisque fries (yes, a mound of French fries drizzled with lobster bisque), salmon, sushi, and ahi tuna. On my last visit, I tried the sushi for the first time after my friend raved about how amazing their sushi was. The waiter suggested the rainbow roll, so I gave that a try. It was super fresh and delicious. I also ordered a cup of the lobster bisque and a side Caesar salad. The lobster bisque is a little too rich for my liking- I prefer it over French fries more. I also love all of their specialty cocktails! I am not a bloody mary fan, but my boyfriend & dad love them from here! Luke Wholey's will always be a favorite spot in Pittsburgh for me."
"5.0","This place was absolutely delicious. I had the Rueben, it was probably the best I've had in a long time. Portion sizes are great and very filling. The staff was very polite and helpful, I highly recommend to anyone in the strip district except Patriot fans, they wouldn't like this place!"
"4.0","A great place to grab brunch on a lazy day when all you feel like doing is choke your arteries.The omelette with mashed potatoes and hotcakes are my top favorites. Be sure to be carrying cash for this one !"
"5.0","Awesome dining experience in the strip District. shrimp volcano was delicious as was Lobster and shrimp pizza.  we also had mahi mahi tacos and sushi. Nice beer selection on tap"
"3.0","I get it.  It's a trendy little spot in the south side that is quick and cheap.  Good service & decent food.  Definitely a step up from the fast food options in town.  Look elsewehere for more options/higher quality."
"1.0","Been in the drive thru with only three cars in front of me for no kidding 30 minutes and counting. I've been waiting so long I've logged onto Yelp for the first time ever to write this review, meanwhile my fianc√© has been waiting for me to pick him up for this long, and there's no exit"
"2.0","I wanted to like my meal here, I really did.  But it was really lackluster for me.  I ordered the vegetarian sandwich with a side of the jalapeno corn salad.  It also comes with cole-slaw.  The sandwich was only 'ok'.  I like roasted veggies, but the whole wheat sandwich bread didn't do it for me.  For a deli turkey, perhaps, but when you have just roasted veggies without anything 'meaty' like a giant portabella cap or fatty like avocado, low-profile bread is a let-down and would really be better off on something thicker like ciabatta or foccacia.  Also, it soaked up the juice from the slaw and the mushroom salad that I received by mistake, and soggy bread is just no bueno on any occasion.  Because I'm not that fussy and it was busy, I didn't say anything about receiving the mushroom salad instead of the jalapeno corn salad, and that's on me.  I do like mushrooms very much, but unfortunately the flavor profile of this salad wasn't balanced enough.  It was so heavy on the vinegar that it overwhelmed the plate.  The slaw was the same--mostly just vinegar and no mayo or oil and not enough sugar (if any) to balance the taste.  If I ever went back, I would probably just try something else, because some of the dishes looked great (the salmon salad being one of them), and the price wasn't *too* horrific for a museum setting."
"4.0","The REAL sandwich king of Pittsburgh.This may sound blasphemous, but I really don't understand the obsession with Primanti Bros.  The bread is too small for the sandwich, the meat tastes weird (especially their 'cheesesteak'), and I just don't feel the love for a heaping handful of french fries stuffed onto a sandwich.  The taste of potatoes shouldn't dominate one's sandwich.Peppi's is the creator of The #7 (nicknamed The Roethlisburger in homage to Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger).  It is an extraordinary combination of hamburger meat and sausage (and they use some of the best tasting sausage available) with American cheese mixed in on the softest of rolls.  Really, Peppi's uses the best bread for their sandwiches and that, in my opinion, is what makes a sandwich.  Located in the Strip District, you can shop your extra sandwich weight off after lunch by visiting any of a few dozen specialty shops in the historic district.  Yinz'll love it!"
"1.0","The service at this restaurant was so shoty.  From the manager to the front cashier.  The level of ineptness was astonishing.  We had a large group of 10 and just wanted a quick bite before hitting the road. Albeit the food was fair the poor level of service made it hard to enjoy.  WILL NOT BE BACK. Training needed at all levels."
"4.0","Yes, this place lived up to the stellar reviews. We were in the neighborhood and decided to chance it and hope for a seat at the bar. I'm glad we did! Luckily, at the time we arrived there were several bar seats available - but it did fill up quickly. I will also note there were no tables available, so other yelp reviews are very accurate when they mention making reservations.The atmosphere here is very funky (in a good way) I love all of the dark decor and night club-like lighting. Please be aware there are several flights of narrow stairs - so be prepared to do some climbing! The bartender who served us was awesome - very knowledgeable of the menu and willing to provide menu recommendations. Neither of us had been here - so we decided to try a few menu items.The robatayaki menu was extensive, but I wouldn't say that we would order from it again. We were served a few small skewers (our bartender let us know they were tiny beforehand so that was appreciated) but the flavor wasn't anything to rave about. We had the Wagyu beef tenderloin, and the Scottish Salmon. Both were good, but not crazy good.For our meals we had the CHIRASHI which was filled with fresh fish, and even a quail egg. I ordered the MISO RAMEN and was extremely happy with not only the flavorful taste, but the amount of veggies (especially mushrooms) that were given.I'm happy I could cross this place off of my PGH food bucket list - I would recommend it to anyone looking for a cool hang out spot - and someone who enjoys a fresh, and unique dining experience."
"3.0","We got three subs and a falafel salad to-go. It wasn't until we got home and opened the bag that I realized that the dressing was missing from my salad. So although the rest of my family enjoyed their subs, sadly my meal was lacking and the falafels tasted dry without the dressing."
"3.0","Meh, this place is OK. Pittsburgh Chinese sucks so there aren't many options, it's pretty much here or Mandarin. I usually go Mandarin if they are open. This is a decent back up when they are closed-- delivery on weekends is weird.... just saying'."
"5.0","Salem's is my go-to market when I want lamb or chicken. They also have a solid amount of Middle Eastern food stuffs and spices, so if you don't have an Uncle Samir to ship you za'atar, you might want to shop around the market a bit.They'll cut any of their meats any way you want right in front of you and have prices that are not only affordably low, but surprising given the excellent quality of the meat. The only chicken I've had that's been cleaner and tastier than Salem's has been directly from the farm down the road from where I grew up. It's worth trying the pre-made marinades, too.I've only eaten at the grill a few times, but was never let down in the quality or consistency of their menu. The cafeteria section is presentable (nothing to fawn over) and a fitting location to pop a squat with a buddy or two as you dig in to the feast in front of you.This review is written with the market in mind and with the grill as an afterthought--seriously, try the meats!"
"3.0","Server Brian was really attentive and nice. Good happy hour specials"
"4.0","I somehow neglected to review Salem's, despite visiting back in Oct. for lunch.  I stopped by at around 11:30 on a Sat., and initially wandered into the Middle Eastern grocery portion.  If you're a newbie like me, note that the portion of the building closest to Penn Ave. is the grocery section--the door to the cafe is off the parking lot on the left side of the building, but can also be accessed through the grocery portion as well.For my lunch, I decided to order a falafel sandwich with a side of fries ($7 and change, if I recall correctly).  The order took about 10 min. to be served, and the portions were decently sized.  The sandwich was tasty enough, but not necessarily the best I've had in PGH (apologies--details escape me given the amount of time that's passed).  The fries were of the lightly battered variety, but weren't fresh cut.  I also ordered a Middle Eastern soda of some kind ($2), which was a unique and refreshing way to wash it all down.Overall, I was pleased with my experience at Salem's.  At the time of my visit, it was pretty quiet and clean, given that it wasn't long after opening.  Aside from a local cop, I was the only white customer, which is a positive sign of the authenticity of the cuisine.  During my visit, I noticed a sign stating that they offer an all-you-can-eat Indian buffet during Ramadan.  If you enjoy large portions of Middle Eastern or Indian cuisine on the cheap, I recommend checking it out."
"4.0","Excellent meal, and great pacing. We ordered and ate as we went which was a nice change of pace. The stairway up to the restaurant was a bit confusing, but loved all the artwork in the darkened halls.Food:Our favorites of the evening were the Okonomiyaki (savory pancake) and the Tonkotsu Ramen Noodle bowl. The flavors and textures were so spot on. We also enjoyed the spicy tuna, scallion, nori rice ball. The vegetable tempura was good and made well, but will probably opt for something else next time. We got pork gyoza last, and for a moment were hoping it got lost in the fray because we were getting full and it had been awhile since we ordered. We liked the cooking technique, which looked like the dumplings were flattened, but I felt the gyoza were very overseasoned, and the saltiness was even more pronounced when tried with the dipping sauce.Drinks:We each tried some sake. One hot sake, and a Falling Petal -  a cold draft sake shot infused with Hibiscus. Both were equally enjoyable, with Falling Petal slightly winning in how refreshing and fun it was with the Hibiscus.The Tickle 'n Giggle with Pop Rocks, Leblon cacha√ßa, basil, coconut lemongrass nigori, lime was fun and delicious. I could not quite figure out how to get the pop rocks into the drink, so I asked our server and she kindly explained how she drinks it. I poured some of the pop rocks on top, which jumped back in my face, and then stirred a few in which complimented the drink throughout the meal. The  Fairy Tail with cava, sweet potato shochu, beet, ginger, lemon, cardamom bitters was refreshing and visually striking with the beet garnish."
"5.0","Excellent Thai food in a simple but nicely decorated interior. The service is always very friendly. The place is clean. Love the BYOB. If you have never been careful on he spice scale. 6/10 starts to get pretty spicy and if you go up from there, you better be ready!  Overall wonderful for dine in or take out."
"4.0","A fun place to go downtown after work or games, etc. A little overpriced, but you expect that in this area (downtown). A good number of TVs for watching games and a casual atmosphere. I would recommend this if you're looking for a good place to go to after work. Happy hour deals aren't the best, but again it's downtown. All you can eat wings on Wednesdays! That's always a plus."
"5.0","Great for date night, one of our favorite restaurants in PGH. Their service, food, byob policy is all fantastic! However, forewarning that the kitchen cant handle large groups."
"4.0","This location was pretty standard. The service was quick, the employees were friendly, and the restaurant was pretty clean. I thought they didn't give super solid portions of the toppings, but they weren't too skimpy."
"5.0","Portobello sandwich was ok.  The hoagie was overwhelming but the insides of the sandwich were good.  The pierogi nachos were excellent and my dudes kielbasa sandwich was en pointe!!! Good place to nosh at while taking a gambling break"
"5.0","Best Chinese in the city.  I always get the wonton soup - buttery and salty, with two big wonton. Lunch plates are lunch sized, but still generous. They have the best brown sauce of anywhere. Seating is a little snug, as they get filled to capacity every day of the week, but there's enough of a din to keep your conversations private."
"1.0","I thought the food and the service were both equally as bad. I ordered a cheese steak and there was l barely and meat and I found it very undercooked. The owner was beyond rude and could care less about a repeat customer. Thumbs down"
"3.0","Pretty good they catered to our swim team did a pretty good job didn't mess up any of the orders. The food tastes the same as the others so nothing special there"
"2.0","ATMOSPHERE:  Dated and cheesy, like an old lady's apartment. Gaudy chandeliers, teal walls, menus on laminated paper...you get the idea. No one at the bar or seated in front at 6PM, never a good sign. PROS:  Can't think of any, honestly. CONS:  Rude service...probably the mother or grandmother/owner waiting tables. Incredibly unfriendly and rude as she took my plate away before I was finished and didn't even ASK if I was done. Food came out in literally 2 minutes, which tells me most of it is pre-cooked and not fresh...it tasted like that too.  Bland and boring...a disgrace to true Italian cooking...like the 'chef' or someone has completely given up.  Prices way too high for microwaved pasta...$20+ per person. Everything reminded me of a 'Kitchen Nightmares' episode as I half expected Gordon Ramsey to pop out from the back. WILL I EVER RETURN?  Nope. Never. With so many amazing new restaurants out there who are innovative and hungry for business, why would you bother beating a dead horse here?"
"5.0","Amazing Catering! I have used Sausalido twice now.Once for my daughter's baby shower, and then for the Baptism. Everyone LOVED the food and kept asking me who the caterer was! The owner is so great to work with! He really took the time to meet with me, and create menus that were perfect for both the parties. The presentation and portions are fantastic too, highly recommend Sausalido!"
"5.0","Not gonna lie, this sandwich was a little hard to eat given how big it was but definitely tasted pretty good. Chicken wasn't dry even tho I took it togo and ate it a few hours later. The sauce for the chicken tenders was different, but pretty good too."
"5.0","The best Indian food I've ever had hands down, and I've had it all around the world at varying price ranges.  The restaurant itself is located in an old mansion, yet the atmosphere is a little lacking as it's on the dark side and lacking in unifying decor.  But the food more than makes up for it and the service is superb; a very friendly, accommodating and helpful staff whom are present just enough to fulfill all needs yet not be intrusive.My husband and I couldn't decide (or agree!) on an appetizer, as they all looked so good, so we ordered the Ethnic Sampler which gave us a fairly substantial taste of the samosa (fried pastry with spicy vegetable filling), vegetable cutlet (deep fried vegetable patties) and mirchi bajji (deep friend chilies stuffed with chutney), enough for two diners so if there are more people in your party you'll want to order more than one.  My husband preferred the samosas and I the mirchi bajji, but we agreed that all were excellent so it's really a matter of personal taste.We usually order our entrees with naan, any of them are good but my favorite is the garlic naan, which is not too greasy but still soft and fragrant and not at all dry.  In the past, we have also ordered the aloo paratha, which I considered a bit less flavorful and more dry than the naan--again, probably personal taste and having to do with the fact that it's made with potatoes. The entrees themselves are excellent and so far I haven't had one I haven't liked, but there are two that stand above all the others.  Oddly enough my favorite is a rice dish, Chicken Biryani, which is not necessarily an entree though I order it as one.  The seasoning and spices used are amazing--very unique--it's very spicy with big chunks of high quality, lean chicken and it comes with a mellow yogurt sauce that helps tone down some of the heat.  My second favorite is the Chicken Pepper Fry, again, very spicy with a complex taste and loads of black pepper.  The one thing Tamarind gets right over and over is spiciness!  I've also had the Chicken Vindaloo, Curry and Aloo Gobi Masala, all very good.  I've always been too full to order dessert so I can't help you out there, though the mango lassi's are wonderful and refreshing.  I always finish mine up with the appetizer and wish I had more later on.Also of note, there's a Dinner for Two Sunday night special that is a phenomenal deal; $25 gets you an appetizer, a bread and two entrees, which is more than enough for two diners.  There are only a few restrictions which are listed clearly in the menu.  Tuesday night is Dosa Night, order one get the second 50% off, and Wednesday night is Student Night, order one entree get the second 50% off, with appropriate student ID."
"2.0","This used to be my favorite place to eat downtown.  Great prices and great food.  However, this last 3 times I have eaten there, the food has been horrible.  The pop and soup both taste like muddy water was used.  The food was below par too.  The brown rice was clumped together and the chicken dint taste good, it was chewy and had a lot of grizzle.  Most likely my last time eating there.  Such a shame because they were really really good."
"3.0","I stumbled on this place late one night when I was starving and looking for something by my hotel. With its booths and that tacky red vinyl seating I remember from childhood pizzerias in NJ, it looked good, so I went in.  The staff was kind of gruff, but my pizza was delicious. That was 2 years and 5 visits ago.Fast foward to last weekend.  Staff is still gruff, but pizza is just pretty good.  It's no longer that much different from any other nearby pizza place, and it looks like their large pizza isn't as large as it used to be.  But since I never really measured them I can't be sure. Bottom line is I will go back if I'm nearby, but I won't make a special effort to go there anymore."
"2.0","Food was amazing, crab cake was phenomenal. We ordered the calamari, mussels, three rivers sushi entree, Maui mahi taco, mini crab cakes.Everything came out great and tasty, except the mussels, while it tasted delicious, there were multiple dead and stinky ones.A older gentleman walked around and talked to customers, and he asked how everything was and I told him. He said it would be taken off, however the manager (different person) took off 50% for the dish after we told the waiter that brought our check at full price. Now I don't care about the $7.50, but it's more about customer service. I've managed restaurants also, and I wouldn't ever refund for a dish if there was no problem and it's just the customer being difficult, but the mussels were dead and there's practically nothing inside, except for the lining of the mussel. Don't tell me you'd refund me for the dish that you made with dead mussels and then not do it. It's a matter of principle, the money is not an issue.This is the first time visiting Pittsburgh, and I heard good things about this place. Food was good, customer service, not that great. And customer service/experience is a big part of my dining experience. Waiter was good though."
"3.0","Just ordered take out from here for my wife and I. Food was good, nothing incredible,  but everything was priced relatively inexpensive. Big plus for being able to order everything online. Would have given 4 stars but delivery took an hour and a half, which seemed a little excessive."
"5.0","Cinderlands Beer in Lawrenceville was a great stop. On a Saturday evening, it's one of the only places where you didn't need a reservation. The crowd it draws is mostly the young adults several years removed from college. At Cinderlands, they sat us quickly and in the upstairs balcony as well. It was a sleek yet cabinesque interior. There were all kinds of games (Apples to Apples, Scrabble, etc.) a group could play while they waited for their food or drink which was truly a nice addition.  The food pictured here is their kielbasa with noodles and the fries. While the prices aren't regular 'bar food' level, it's for good reason. The portion sizes are huge and the quality is excellent. The drink menu is large too! This made for a fun evening, and I hope to be back soon!"
"5.0","One of my favorite places to eat breakfast in the Strip. I love the French toast with the berry compote. My husband had a croissant breakfast sandwich and couldn't finish it.  I like the idea of the self-serve infused water.  It is casual dining at it's best, good food and fast service."
"2.0","We thought that we would give Mezzo a try, since most of the Yelp reviews were positive. Let me start off with the positive parts:Service was very good.Good selection of wines by the glass, and reasonable prices.The food was underwhelming at best, and sometimes disappointing. I would say that the salmon tartar tasted like it was made out of smoked salmon, not fresh. The dressing on the salad was anything but a jalape√±o vinaigrette - I could have sworn that it came right out of a bottle of Hidden Valley ranch dressing. The chicken was flavorless, although the vegetables that accompanied it were tasty. The cornbread added absolutely nothing to the plate but taking up space. The box of bread that we ordered was average. The complementary cookie that came with the bill tasted like it came out of a box.I am sure that there are better options in Pittsburgh than this."
"5.0","Great food, great staff.  Every one is always friendly.  Bartenders ways make sure customers are safe!  The paper plates make me feel like I am at a picnic!  Love it!  The place is always clean, floors clean, tables clean and bar area/counters wiped.  I have never seen it dirty.  Bathrooms are always clean and toilet paper, soap, etc filled.  If you go, make sure you ask for Amanda, she is the best!"
"1.0","I AM BOYCOTTING ALEXANDER'S FOR LIFE!!! The manager SCREAMED AT ME at the top of his lungs in an epic meltdown that lasted 10 minutes! On Sat., April 12, 2014, I attended the 50th birthday party for my dear friend, David Flynn. I organized the party, but relied on Dave and his sister to provide me with the final head count. I made the reservation for 25 people.The manager and I played phone tag for the two days before the event. I called back and left messages TWICE to confirm, but apparently he never got my messages. (This was part of his rant, his indignation at unreturned phone calls that actually HAD been returned!)The dinner started at 7 PM. Most of our group arrived on time, but some of our group (including me) arrived between 8 PM-9 PM. I was working on a homemade birthday present for Dave, which took longer than expected. I called Dave, his sister and my friends (Reesa & Joel) to tell them I was running late. In hindsight, I should have also called the restaurant to let them know, and for that I am truly sorry. That still doesn't justify the manager SCREAMING AT ME FOR 10 MINUTES!After enjoying a delicious dinner, drinks and birthday cake, none of us had a clue that anything was wrong. If the decision to return to a restaurant were based SOLELY on the food and wait staff, I would definitely return to Alexander's. But sadly, when the manager has a nuclear meltdown and throws a 10-MINUTE SCREAMING TEMPER TANTRUM, it tends to sour one on returning to a restaurant.Towards the end of our dinner, some of us started to smell cigarette smoke, which we later realized was coming from the patio out front. (It was a warm night, and they had the front sliding-glass doors open.) In the midst of the smoke discussion, the manager approached our table and began an EPIC RANT, SCREAMING AT ME FOR 10 MINUTES!!!He was angry that everyone in our group hadn't arrived at exactly 7 PM. The restaurant's kitchen is open till 10 PM on Sat. night, so I don't understand why this was a big deal. We ended up with 20 people total and 5 no-shows. I am always disappointed by no-shows, but I explained this possibility to the manager when I made the reservation. I STILL BROUGHT HIM 20 PAYING CUSTOMERS! BTW...the dining room was practically EMPTY, which is not what I would expect on a Saturday night in Pittsburgh. Maybe I'm not the first customer to be on the receiving end of the manager's meltdown.The manager SCREAMED that he had called me twice, and I hadn't called him back! He ranted about this about a dozen times. I told him I HAD called him back - TWICE. It's not my fault if he didn't get my messages. He SCREAMED that he had put an extra waitress and cook on staff because he expected 25 people. He SCREAMED that I had cost the restaurant $100! How much money do you think 20 people spent on appetizers, dinner and drinks? I find it hard to believe that they didn't make any money, or at least break even. I am sorry that there were 5 no-shows in our group, but I always thought Saturday night was the busiest night of the week for most restaurants. I didn't realize the restaurant would look like a deserted, old western ghost town with hardly any customers. On a Saturday night, I assumed they would have a full staff on duty with or without my reservation. I was wrong. I'm sorry. I'm not perfect.The manager also YELLED at me and my friends for 'LOOKING COMFORTABLE' in his restaurant!!! Since when is looking comfortable an OFFENSE??? I thought restaurants wanted you to feel comfortable, but apparently not at Alexander's.He also SCREAMED that one of the waitresses only got a $1.00 tip! I found that hard to believe, but just in case he wasn't making it up, I tipped my waitress $35 on my $26 dinner check! I am a former waitress, and I would feel HORRIBLE if any waitress every got ripped off on my watch! Even if his story wasn't true, I figured she deserved an extra big tip just for having to WORK in such a horrible place where the manager YELLS at paying customers!!! If he treats the customers this way, I can only imagine how he treats the employees. THE MANAGER'S RUDE BEHAVIOR HAS COST HIM MY BUSINESS AND MY FRIENDS' BUSINESS FOREVER!!! During his rant, he actually SCREAMED that he never wanted to see me in his restaurant ever again! I'm happy to grant him that wish. And so are my friends. This is an example of the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have ever witnessed in my entire life!!! I thought the manager was going to have a heart attack or a stroke the way he was SCREAMING FOR 10 MINUTES!SCREAMING at paying customers is completely unacceptable behavior, and I will NEVER eat at Alexander's ever again. It's really a shame because I loved their salmon with pesto sauce. But great food can't make up for a manager who throws a TEMPER TANTRUM and SCREAMS AT YOU. Also, you can smell smoke in the dining room, which sucks. My friends and I are BOYCOTTING ALEXANDER'S FOR LIFE!!!"
"3.0","Really good burgers and cold beer.  Very very crowded on game day.  Service is as attentive as it can be when there are 200 more people in the restaurant than seats."
"5.0","Really enjoy the locally driven menu and you can taste the freshness. Meat hangs over the bun, great local beers, dressing for salad were all delicious."
"5.0","You won't find a better meal or better people outside of Italy. Cavatelli and Tiramisu is to kill for! If you want a taste of Italy, this is the place!!"
"4.0","Living in Bloomfield, I was excited to finally try some authentic, excellent Italian fare. Unfortunately, I hadn't had much luck so far at Pleasure Bar (okay food), or D'Amico's (awful food). I've had more consistent, tasty Italian at the Olive Garden, which is sad. So I decided to give Alexander's Italian Bistro a try.We stopped in tonight, a Saturday evening. The place was pretty much full and we didn't have a reservation, but we got seated after just a few minutes. The tables are packed pretty tight and you can see the servers dancing around each other precariously. The decor is charming without being all tacky like other local Italian places...I love the beautiful backlit stained glass panels that open the space up. There is a nice little bar area in the front with a smaller bar food menu and a couple nice TVs...we'll have to check that out soon.Mr. got the Eggplant Alexander, I got the Mafalda Alexander. The eggplant was nice and crispy, not mushy inside like eggplant parmesan can often turn out. It was very rich and definitely two meals worth of food. My pasta was excellent. The noodles were flavorful on their own, and cooked freshly and perfectly. I like the mafalda noodles, which aren't too commonly used in most Italian places. The sauce, a mixture of marinara and alfredo, was tasty and not overpowering. The spicy Italian sausage was soooo good...just the right amount of spicy, tender and flavorful. They give a pretty large basket of bread that is moist, fresh, and flaky.We got the tiramisu for dessert, which was pretty good. It's hard to find real tiramisu anyways so I give them credit for having it. The ladyfingers were a little bit tough to cut with a spoon but they were good, and the cream was very good, not too sweet. A nice finish to the meal.Only downsides...no soup or salad included with the dish, those are extra. Our server was nice enough but kinda disappeared when we were finished with our food...we waited around a good 15 minutes for her to come back and wrap Mr.'s leftovers and ask if we wanted dessert, then another 10 minutes after finishing dessert for her to come back with the check. This is one of my top pet peeves.Alexander himself (I'm pretty sure anyway...) stopped by the table at the end of our meal to ask how everything was, which is always a nice touch in my book. Everyone working there seemed like they must be family, but not the type of family who dread working for the family business, which is nice.We'll definitely be back."
"5.0","This place opened over the weekend and I was dying to try it today. Chicken sandwich was out of this world! Juicy, tender and DAMN hot. I ordered the hottest spice level, and it lived up to the name. Mac n cheese was good, sauce a little thick. Also wanted to mention that both cashiers were very nice, welcoming with great smiles. Going to go back when I'm not at work and I can enjoy a beer or 2. Definitely recommend trying this place."
"5.0","This place was awesome. Not gonna lie, it definitely felt like we needed a password to get in. But after ascending two flights of steep steps, we were greeted with a really bright and fun restaurant! My friends and I went on a Saturday early evening around 445pm and sat bar side. From what the hostess said (dinner tables were reserved up until 1130pm) you def need a reservation on busy nights. Rookie mistake but we got lucky and beat most of the dinner traffic. The music was GREAT. The bartenders were fun and super helpful. I throughly enjoyed my dinner. My friends got the Ramen, fried chicken and sushi. I grabbed the deviled eggs () open faced dumplings and the salmon collar special. All of which, I'd most definitely get again!"
"4.0","If you love breakfast than this is the place for you. There are three locations so be sure to go to the one closest to you! the pancakes are so delicious that you can't possibly have a bad day if you're starting with a plate of these warm and crispy flapjacks. They have special way of making breakfast potatoes such that you will understand the lines outside on a Saturday. It is cash only but also fairly cheep! it's a fail safe for everyone."
"3.0","The food we got was very good. We were greeted well and the cashier staff was extremely friendly. Once we got up stairs the tables were reflecting a lot of light in our eyes since we were given a table outside. This was no problem at all because they had large umbrellas that were out on the deck, they just needed to be opened since the sun was coming out. We waited for our food to arrived and asked the waitress if we could put up the umbrella over our table and she said it was not a problem. She then went and put up all of the umbrellas on the deck which was fine but every time someone looked at her she said 'sorry guys, it's not me, it's them' and pointed at us. It was the most awkward and unprofessional experience I have ever had at a restaurant. We will not be retuning because we were called out in front of every table on the deck for asking for some shade so we could see our food.  She did not have to put up all the umbrellas if people did not want them up, and she did not have to call us out in such a rude way."
"4.0","Went yesterday for my parents 30th anniversary. We went for a late lunch so the restaurant was empty when we arrived. Our waiter was fabulous! He was very attentive and wanted to make sure the experience was wonderful for my parents. We started with wine and apps, and I loved the fried zucchini. It wasn't overly breaded and were were able to split it between six people and not worry about not having enough. I ordered a Malfada pasta with feta spinach and sundried tomatoes and it was excellent! It was the perfect portion and spiced wonderfully. My parents each got chicken parm and devoured it.  All in all a wonderful experience and we will definitely return."
"2.0","I wanted to like this place, but I just didn't.  The staff were all very friendly and the little nata that I got was good, but I really didn't love any of the rest of it.   For starters, they have those terrible chairs that are popular everywhere now - you know, the metal ones where you have to be tiny or suffer though the back support digging into your butt and sides.  Even the smallest in our group (who might be a size medium) was uncomfortable.   The food didn't wow me either.  I love all types of cuisines and was excited to try everything.   We sampled the salt cod and octopus casseroles along with the chicken and pepper sandwich.  I also got a shrimp fritter and the nata from the case.   The salt cod casserole looked great with a cloud of egg whites on top, but under that was a bland and soupy mess.  The octopus was the best dish of the bunch, but was mostly potato and sauce - very little meat.   The sandwich was 80% bread with a thin piece of chicken and a few peppers.  The side of homefries were partially undercooked.   The shrimp fritter may have been good, but it was unevenly warmed (warm outside and cold inside).   The nata was delicious.   Between the uncomfortable chairs, the incomplete menu (none of the stuff in the case was listed on the menu and they were out of several things that were listed on the menu), and the food not being great - I just didn't love it."
"5.0","Great food, great service, great atmosphere!!We had a party of 6 and made a reservation through Reso. If you go to Umami's website there is a link to make reservations.  I would recommend making a reservation as many days in advance as you can as this place fills up fast!One member of our party was gluten free and our server was able to make great menu recommendations to accommodate (the zucchini dengaku app was the best). We ordered four apps to share then each ordered our own entree. We were full but not disgustingly so. Every dish we ordered was very good and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals. I highly recommend the Okonomiyaki. It is like a potato pancake appetizer with bacon, broccoli and delicious sauces on top. To enter the restaurant you must walk up several flights of stairs so keep that in mind if needed!"
"5.0","Im visitin pittsburgh all the way from europe, my favorite kinda food is crepe, and i was wondering if i can find a good place to have some in the united states, couple of my friends told me to go to Caff√© Mona and try it. so i went there today for the first time. It is so european, cozy, such a lovely place, they have too many good options on the menu and its not that pricey at all. I had a mr green crepe its asiago mozarella feta with some fresh baby spinach in it. That was soo good.. comes with side salad and costs me only 9$. Server was so kind and quick. During my pittsburgh visit i believe this place will be on top of my restaurant list. They have a beautiful patio with umbrellas i love it.. you all gotta see this place"
"2.0","Mediocre at best.  See that delicious looking picture up there that shows you how great the chicken tenders are?  Well that's exactly what I ordered, except for mine, they came fried a little extra.  I might be being kind with that.  The were fried extra to the point where each bite tasted of burnt coating.  No matter what I dipped them in I still tasted the burnt-ness.Next time I order from here, I'll make sure to order something that doesn't come from the fryer."
"5.0","I got the hot chicken sandwich and it was fantastic. The girl out of the counter tried to talk me out of it but I'm glad I stuck with it as it had a nice burn. The slaw that went on top of the sandwhich which was also tremendous. My fries were on the cool side but were still good with the seasoning. I'm officially a fan and will be back after the next hoops game."
"3.0","Overall I enjoy the food here and have been here a couple of times. Unfortunately it seems like pretty regularly they mess up my order, most recently I ordered and paid for a protein to be added and when I got back to the office I found out they didn't have it.  I'll probably be back, but would recommend checking the food closely prior to leaving if you've asked for any customizations or extras."
"5.0","I love their pizza!My favorite is the steak/chicken ranch pizza. It is amazing! Have not met anyone who does not love it. Seriously go try it. Like now."
"2.0","I gave this 2 stars because I've been here no less than 5x and this time was so unbelievably poor it needed downgraded substantially. Here are some highlights:The tacos... there are 3. I asked if I could order one more (to total 4) so my friend and I could split them evenly. Tacos are hard to split! I was asked to repeat myself and got a smirking response. I requested she ask her manager if it was a possibility. I've had this done before and they've added an al a carte charge, which I told her I was fine with. She came back to deliver some drinks, a long time after, and I inquired about my request. She began laughing and said, 'the kitchen manager said no. He said if you want to do that you can order two orders and he will just throw out two.'  HOW RUDE IS THAT RESPONSE?! I let her know I thought it was rude and asked to speak to the manager. She said, 'I already did. He said NO.'  I asked if there was a reason and she replied, 'he said no.' We NEVER got the pretzels we ordered. When I was looking at the bill she asked what I was doing. I explained I was making sure there was not a charge for the pretzels I ordered.... she said 'oh shoot. I forgot.' I agreed and she made no effort to apologize, make it right, and didn't ask if we still wanted them. Just 'oh shoot. I forgot.'I never got a second drink, neither did my friend. We went to the bar because our server was missing. Typically this place has decent food, but the service has always been a crap shoot. There's no reason for the rude service we received that night, especially since we were entertaining out of town guests and wanted to show off their restaurant. We will go elsewhere from this point on. I was embarrassed."
"4.0","I visited for the first time for a friend's going away party. I loved the atmosphere and closeness of the space with the open glass doors. The staff was attentive and helpful. I enjoyed a French 75 to drink. Others in my party enjoyed the same. I shared French fries with aioli dipping sauce and macaroni and cheese. The fries were so tasty and I loved the dipping sauce. We cleaned the plate. The next appetizer, macaroni and cheese, was very cheesy and filling. I could not eat all of it."
"5.0","This was a nice family Italian restaurant.  Food was very good, and service was excellent.  Our server was a young lady named Mieke, and she really added a lot of pleasure to the dining experience. We would certainly go back to dine here again."
"4.0","All of the hype is spot-on for this place and I can't wait to go back and try more!!I would order a little differently next time as I think their sashimi and hand-rolls are a little overpriced based on my experience at other places around the city. The quality was great and I enjoyed the salmon sashimi and striped bass handroll we ordered, but I'd focus more on the Yatai menu next time since those options are a little more unique.My boyfriend and I split an order of the Miso Ramen (with extra noodles) because we heard the portions were huge. And they are! The ramen had crispy chili, edamame, nori, scallions and mushrooms. We added two Nitamago, which are soy-marinated poached eggs that you absolutely must add. It was SO delicious. The broth was very hearty and the mix of flavors was addictive. We finished the whole bowl despite being full about half-way through.With our food and two drinks each (2 beers, sake and some Japanese whiskey), our bill came to just under $90. If you are looking to keep it cheap, skip the drinks and you can totally get a reasonably priced and filling meal here."
"2.0","I wanted to like Sausalido, I really did.  I had talked to the chef at Gooski's one night last spring and when the groupons came out i was excited to get one.  My girlfriend and I went on a weeknight, which was also one of the last days that we were eligible to use the groupon.  Per standard groupon procedure, the place was packed.  We spoke to the Chef while he was out front smoking and he said, 'it was a crazy night' and they had been 'slammed' because of the groupon.  We had a reservation and were seated about 20 minutes after our reservation time which I didn't think was too bad.  Sausalido is BYOB and they seemed surprised that we did not bring wine.  We were served a white bean dip to snack on and it was incredible.  I would have been much happier with our dinner if it would have been only that.  I ordered the shrimp and gazpacho shooters appetizer and was pleased at how quickly we received it and its taste.  The bowls it was served in were strange because it was too much to shoot but difficult to get a spoon into.  No matter though, they were fantastic.  I ordered the London Broil ($26) and my girlfriend got the pork chop ($23).  We were served small dinner salads with beets and it was so bad I don't even want to think about it.  My girlfriend's pork chop was good, but didn't blow her away.  My london broil was.....strange.  I really don't have another word for it.  It just seemed like a bad piece of meat.  For dessert we ordered the red velvet cheesecake and it was practically frozen and had tastes of mint.  I tried to enjoy it but I was pushing more and more of it onto my girlfriend.  The dinner was promising at the start, but went downhill fast.  I'm sorry for the simple review, but dinner at Sausalido did not provide lasting memories and we were clearly disappointed as we left.  Based on other reviews I can only assume that I went on a bad night, but it was bad enough that I will not go back.  I have too many other places in Pittsburgh to try."
"1.0","Pretty disappointed in this place with regards to food and service. When I sat down at a table with my 9 month baby, a man (I think the owner Ray) started barking at me down the hallway saying 'YOU CAN'T SIT, YOU DON'T HAVE A NUMBER', literally as my parents were paying for our food. Geez, I just wanted to settle my baby down, you didn't have to yell and make me feel terrible for my first time there. We sat in front of the kitchen, and the whole time I kept listening to him micro manage all the employees and even argue with them in front of our family at least 3 times. Everyone who worked there literally seemed miserable and we didn't get one smile the whole time. The food was not seasoned AT ALL, and over half my plate was just bland potatoes as filler. The only decent thing we ate were the blueberry ricotta pancakes, but I feel like I can make them at home next time. Sorry, even if the food was that great, that man was a huge turn off and there are better brunch joints with friendlier service than yours."
"1.0","So we wanted to get brunch and my friend thought that this would be a good idea. The service sucked so horrible that it made us lose our appetite.  The waiter asked us if we were ready to order (we weren't) and sighed. We had just gotten seated and already we were feeling unwanted.  Once we ordered we waited for what seemed like ages, it was actually 40 minutes, and he never came over to tell us where our food was, if we wanted more water, to apologize for the wait, anything.  The people who came after us (smaller party) got their food before us.  My friends and I  were furious, we were going to just get up and leave and then he finally brought our food (no explanation either). We didn't even order anything particularly extravagant.  My friends both ordered savory crepes and I ordered the White Salad.  It was good, but way too much chicken.  My friends both said that the food was so creamy and rich that it made them sick.  TLDR: I would never go back, not even for big portions."
"5.0","We were recently in Pittsburgh and decided to have dinner at the Capital Grill. We had reservations at 8 and were promptly seated when we arrived at 750. Our server was Margie and she went over everything with us and was a wonderful server. For an app I had the burrata and tomatoes and I was very impressed- perfect!!! For our main course I had the tomahawk veal chop and my wife the rack of lamb. Both cooked perfect rare, and the quality of the cut was top shelf. We had asparagus on the side and it also was perfect. Overall the Capital Grill did not disappoint and I highly recommend."
"5.0","They are so awesome here; what a small gem for tacos in Pgh! They have soft corn with this slow roasted pork carnitas OMG. Make sure to get 2-3 at least. They make sauces that you can use there and buy in bottles which the mango is poppin! -Darian"
"3.0","Unfortunately, Brighton Heights only has a few places within walking distance (or free delivery distance) that make good food.  Wiseguys is one I'm still on the fence about. I've had several items from them, wings, sandwiches, and pizza. Their pizza is par with the rest of the city, nothing special to write about. Their steak sandwich was bland and overcooked, but the veggies they added on were cooked well. They have several other sandwiches that are covered in obnoxious amounts of toppings, probably just to confuse your palate to thinking that you're eating something good. I must say though, their bread is really good. And this is coming from a South Philly girl. Their wings are hit or miss. The first few times I've ordered them, they were big and cooked well. I ordered last night, and they were puny and soggy. And now they charge 25¬¢ more for crispy? So I paid the extra charge and still got soggy wings. Oh, and don't tell me about delivery times,  I live two minutes from wiseguys. I think if they could get their consistency down, I'd be happy to order more often. They're great in a pinch, though. Happy Eating!"
"1.0","Save your time - it's precious. Even though the place was empty enough to be seated immediately, it took over 45 minutes to get 2 dishes, and then 1 of them was wrong. Another 30 minutes later, the chicken wrap was finally done properly.  I guess they had to pluck and butcher a fresh bird.The server never even took our drink order. A manager gave us a paltry $3 off the check for this huge inconvenience.  I emailed 5 days ago and have yet to hear anything from the management. Redbeards clearly does not value customers or want repeat business."
"5.0","Great little place. Fun service and good food. It's in the Strip District which is a really fun area. The salmon plate was very good according to my boss. My eggs and sausage was good. The red potatoes were a nice touch.  Treat yourself to this fun place."
"5.0","This is BY FAR my favorite place on the mount. Their drinks are tasty and the bartenders are friendly. If you don't see what you want on the menu, they will make you whatever you want. Be sure to stop in for happy hour! They have great food and drink specials."
"4.0","Quick and easy. Hometown fave. Nothing like stopping in to get a milkshake and slice of pie. Waitress' are always friendly and chatty. Simple place to dine yet full of history!!"
"5.0","it's impossible to beat a large pizza for $6. the service is super fast and exactly what you need from a pizza place. definitely the best pizza near pitt and won't disappoint."
"2.0","Get me some Peanutzz!! We decided on a whim to try something different for a bar and this place indeed was. Saturdays there is a cover for the DJ which was $3. This didn't seem so bad to me after coming from other cities where the covers are $15 and $20 and higher but I feel like the place could use the money. Peanutz is a small venue. The bar area is narrow and cramped then to the left of it there is a dark area where the DJ is along with some tables and then the stairs to the bathroom. If you weren't at the bar then people were just sitting at the tables starring at the DJ or at you... Maybe one or two people were dancing to the music. I thought the music was awesome though - a mix of old school and underground hip hop. Beers were so cheap - I think we paid $5 for three draft beers. Woot!! However some folks were smoking and the bathrooms were gross. My jacket took a few days to air out the smell of the smoke. I won't be returning even if Peanutz offered some peanuts."
"3.0","Smoked Gouda.. Delicious. White bean dip.. Delicious! The braised chicken breast with peaches was ok, nothing special and kind of bland. The flank steak is a much better choice!"
"5.0","Was visiting and doing a brew crawl on Saturday night. Dropped in and had the best beer of the night PINEAPPLE PASSIONFRUIT WHIPPER - BERLINER WEISSE! Didn't eat there but watched the kitchen prepare the food while we sat at the bar. Looked great! Staff was attentive and friendly!"
"2.0","I was here at the Pamela's in Shadyside a few weeks ago - dining companion and I were looking for a nice brunch-y place to visit. Naturally, with all the high ratings we saw on Yelp! for Pamela's, we gave it a shot.I have to ask: What is all the fuss about this place?My companion and I were a little dismayed to see it was a cash-only place, but luckily in Shadyside there is a PNC just up the street. The restaurant was fairly busy with lots of customers chatting at their tables. It wasn't an uninviting atmosphere, more laid-back, but also a little indifferent, if that makes any sense. Our waitress wasn't unfriendly, but didn't really go out of her way to talk much with us.After perusing the menu for a bit, the fella ordered a Greek salad with chicken while I went for the crepe-hotcake dish. Food came out pretty fast, but that was sadly the best part about it.My companion's tiny salad was served in a large silver bowl, like the chef had mixed it up and decided better of putting it on an actual plate. The Greek dressing was saturated with lemon flavor, way too tart and sour, and the chicken was pretty paltry for the price.My crepe-hotcake thingies were okay, but very oily and griddle-tasting. Way too rich to finish.Overall, we found ourselves very underwhelmed with Pamela's. Our search for a good brunch place continues."
"5.0","Such good tacos. I come here whenever I'm in south side. They make everything fresh right in front of you and it's just so good. There are several meat options and taco options, including walking tacos, which is cool. I always get the chicken tacos--2 if I'm just regular hungry or 3 if I'm really hungry. I have never had a bad experience here. It can get kinda crowded because the space is small and there are only a few seats, so if you are going at peak meal hours, I wouldn't plan on sitting inside unless you are alone. It is such a good value for your money and I am always impressed!"
"4.0","The food is amazing here. The restaurant busy and the food is always fresh.. Today I got chicken curry, falafel sandwich and chicken samosas ... The samosas were okay  that's why I gave them 4 stars. But the curry and sandwich was amazing! I am going there again for sure ."
"5.0","Can I give Umami 10 stars? The appetizers were good.  A bacon wrapped quail egg sounds amazing in theory but in practice really just tasted like bacon.  The chicken thigh and scallion were fantastic.  I have a shellfish allergy, sadly, and cannot eat sushi, but the fiancee says that the mackerel was outstanding, and he gave extremely high marks to the fried balls of octopus (I keep trying to think of a way to write that so it doesn't sound like he was eating octopus testicles).  But the 10 stars, and my newfound obsession with Umami, is due to the tonkatsu ramen.  I really, really, really love ramen.  A lot.  And this is bar none the best ramen I've ever eaten.  I want to eat it three meals a day every day for the rest of my life.  Tips/info: The restaurant is pretty small, which probably explains why it's hard to get a reservation, and you have to walk up three flights of stairs to get to it, so think twice before taking anyone elderly or who can't do stairs - you have to go up and down stairs to use the restroom as well.   It's pretty dark and loud as well, so in short, don't take your parents to eat there."
"1.0","We arrived at 9:17 pm on Sunday, 7/29, and the website said they were open until 10 pm. We took an Uber there specifically because we had wanted to try this restaurant. We walked in to find two waitresses sitting at the bar and patrons eating and drinking at the bar. The bartender 'greeted us' by telling us they were closed and had closed at 9 pm. We told him the website said they were open until 10. And, he said, 'Well, it's a little slow so we decided to close early at 9:30.' We told him we had made an Uber trip specifically for the restaurant and he shrugged his shoulders. Then, we walked outside to call an Uber and someone ran in to pick up a to go order. 1) If he is going to lie, he should stick to one lie--not vacillate between two closing times. And, It was not even 9:30, if he wants to be that technical. 2) They apparently don't care about making money or being polite. 3) People we're still eating and drinking inside! 4) He didn't even act apologetic. 5) The proximity to Little Italy is misleading."
"5.0","At first glance we were not so sure about this place but after getting our food all our worries went away. Our breakfast was wonderful!!!"
"4.0","Great little pizza shop for a fast togo pizza.  They have great pick up prices on the large one topping pizza or the DON with one topping, this being there largest cut pizza.  The pop bottle frig serves surprisingly very cold 2liters or ice teas.  I really can't speak for anything else because I veered off-course one time from my normal large one topping and ordered cheese sticks.  They where warm but not stingy cheese and the grease tasted as if it needed changed. Get the pizza and you can't go wrong"
"4.0","This is a cute place to stop to grab a bite to eat.  We ate here for a tiny snack after our Phipps flower trip, so I cannot fully rate the place because all we got was a Hummus wrap and a green been salad.  However, they were both delicious.  I loved my green beans.  There were onions and cranberries within the green bean salad which added a very delicious part to the plate.The atmosphere of this place is also fantastic.  It is very trendy and clean.  One can see the cleanness based off the fact there is 5 different kinds of cans for garbage.  Very cool and very trendy.  I wish more places were like this.I want to come back here and actually have a real lunch, so I can actually have a good opinion, but based on what I experienced, I would definitely come back."
"5.0","This is my go-to place for thai food. The food is consistently good.The service is super fast. The price is very reasonable.The portions are huge.What more to say? I've recommended this place to everyone I know."
"4.0","Legit Japanese restaurant. Probably the only one in Pittsburgh. Of course, high quality food comes with a higher price. However, if you want a real Japanese experience, come here. We wanted to try their sukiyaki or shabu shabu, but it's a minimum order for two, so we tried other things. The rolls we had were really good. I just wish they had a few pieces more per serving. However, we'll definitely be back. Service was excellent from start to finish! Give it a try for a real Japanese experience in the burgh, but be prepared for a more expensive night out."
"5.0","I used to go to Sammy's Famous Corned Beef and the food is excellent! I went downtown to get a sandwich and it was shut down and I couldn't find them.About 3 months ago I found a Sammy's Famous Corned Beef on Liberty & Ninth Ave,I was so happy to find Sammy's I had to stop and get Sammy's Famous Corned Beef Sandwich! Now I try to go at least twice a week to get the best sandwich & it comes with a pickle and I ask for the mustard on the side!"
"5.0","These tacos are out of this world! By far my favorite taco spot in the Burgh! Also the service is amazing! Ashley and Sean are so sweet to me everytime always greeting me with a how are you and a smile! If you haven't been here you need to get down here and try these fire tacos!!!! Plus the owner Andy is a fucking gentleman and a scholar, I really hope he continues to open amazing businesses like this..."
"4.0","My hubby and I took the hop on hop off bus tour and they suggested this place. He is not a fan of seafood really but he said he could find something. I ordered the lobster roll with fries and he had blackened Baja shrimp on rice with broccoli. Both meals were great!!! Service was excellent and you won't believe the fancy Bloody Mary they serve there!"
"5.0","I LOVE this place. The food and service are extraordinary. Please stop complaining if you didn't think to call ahead and get a reservation. Luke is an amazing owner that genuinely cares about your dining experience."
"3.0","We came here on a Wednesday night and there was a small crowd. People were mostly just eating and not doing any heavy drinking. The interior is a decent size and there were sports playing on the TVs throughout, with some large ones at the bar itself. Our large group sat at a table and ordered some appetizers to share.The bar food was good, although nothing to write home about. The service was good and once some of the people both from our group and the restaurant cleared out, we moved to the bar area. We closed the place out that night with drinks and they were good about letting us finish up 'after the bell' before sending us on our way."
"5.0","beware of parking police! we got towed! $145.00! tacos great but parking police made for a very bad experience!"
"4.0","TOP NOTCH! We were visiting from out of town and cruised Yelp for some ideas for dinner. This was a great find. The Kentucky Fig and the Seasonal Mule were a great start and it continued from there. We are from TX and we love our beef and the burgers were to die for. They were cooked perfectly and just the right size. We will be back!"
"5.0","I love this place! Best brunch spot everrr, the turkey fig sandwich is the bomb. The owners are super nice too. Great customer service  also you gotta get a Nutella crepe, you just have to."
"5.0","This place is great! The people working there are always so friendly no matter how busy they are. I've tried quite a few dishes and have never been let down.My personal favorite dish is the lamb shawarma (sandwich, not salad). It's a huge portion of food and the cost is under $7.00. It is difficult to eat the entire thing in one setting, but when it does happen, it sends me right into a (wonderful) food coma.Additionally, the market side is a nice little place. They have a pretty good selection of Indian/Middle Eastern spices. I've purchased meat from them a few times as well, all of which is very fresh and clean."
"4.0","As Thai food are getting more popular - there's a new one popping up all over the place. This one is on top of my list along with Thai Spoon, Pusadees and Banana Leaf. However, the price is slightly cheaper compared to the others and the food portions (depending on what you get) are pretty large for the price. The noodle bowls are ginormous and equally delicious.Not the fanciest restaurant in terms of decor but the service and food are top notch. Would definitely recommend stopping by."
"4.0","New spot in what seems to be a cursed segment of Forbes Avenue but I, for one, hope this place lasts. Service was fast and friendly and the menu has enough options to be satisfying but not so many that you feel overwhelmed. Prices are average no compliments or complaints. I got the salad... note I think it's the only 'healthy-ish' thing on the menu so I'm not sure exactly what the health conscious do here... they do stress the antibiotic free chicken cooked in peanut oil ie the chicken is fried but, you know, the healthiest kind but for the most part this place is for chicken lovers. I found the amount of chicken in the salad to be reasonable, the dressing to be perfect and the overall taste delicious. I probably would skip the celery next time but that's a matter of personal taste. Not giving five stars because I can't honestly say it was the best chicken I have ever tasted but it was definitely quite tasty. Breakfast is half off from 7 to 11 in May so I'll be back!"
"1.0","Nothing spectacular.  We went in for lunch this past weekend.  The food was average (burger was too pink for me).  When I asked for it to be cooked more, I was told it would take 15 to 20 minutes. We were unable to wait that long (it took 25 minutes just to be served).  We left and ate at Primanti Brothers."
"5.0","Great lunch specials! Fantastic and friendly service. This place is my go to for lunch. The General Tso Chicken is my favourite. The chicken is crispy and well sauced. Their egg rolls are well filled and flavourful. The shrimp fried rice is the best I've ever had. Also if your a fan of Marvel's Agents of SHEILD there is a fun Easter Egg for you."
"4.0","Three friends and I went here for dinner on a Saturday night before an event over at The Warhol.  We made a reservation through Open Table, and I would recommend that because they were busy.We all started off with a drink.  I had the Mezzorita, the Mezzo's take on a margarita.  It was good, but not great.  I'd get it again, but after trying the other cocktails.  Everyone else seemed to like their drinks.  For the main course, I had the wild mushroom risotto.  It was delicious.  I would definitely go back for that and I highly recommend it as one of their vegetarian options.  I had some friends get too much food, so I got to try some of the broccoli and eggplant pizza and rice pudding.  Both were delicious.I'll be going back to Mezzo the next time I'm downtown for an event.  It's a nice place that is conveniently located to Downtown, the North Shore and the Cultural District.  Which means I'll be back there soon."
"4.0","I ordered the medium spice tofu penang curry. It came with hot rice. It was pretty good and well spiced. It came with generous amount of tofu, peas, carrots, broccoli, and bell pepper. I wasn't the biggest fan of the diced carrot and peas in the curry, but overall the taste was great."
"3.0","Went during Crab fest. Our waiter was really nice and checked in on us frequently, even when the place was packed.Had fried calamari as an appetizer - it was waaaaayyy to breaded and fried.For the entree I ordered a pound of the Dungeness Crab legs which was $19 per pound. Flavor was nice, not too salty, and probably more preferred than the more expensive crab legs, like Snow or King."
"5.0","This is my favorite Shadyside breakfast/brunch spot. The food is amazing and doesn't take too long to be served. My personal favorite is the strawberry hotcakes. It's a cash only diner though so make sure you have cash before you walk over. The line can get pretty crazy around lunch time especially on the weekend."
"4.0","Didn't know what to expect but am glad we went. Cute layout where we sat at the food bar. I got to watch someone's order get cooked on the hibachi, which was very fun. Three of us all got one of my standard  orders, chirashi, in which I had my first quail egg. Casual, cute  place with good energy. Look forward to checking them out again!"
"4.0","Just lovely! I had family in from out of town as we all had a relative being treated at AGH. I convinced them to walk the couple of blocks to try this place, as I had read about it somewhere. Though the neighborhood is still on the upswing and has a less than pristine facade, this place is a gem! Beautifully decorated, clean, and welcoming. The staff was helpful and patient. And most importantly the tea was delicious... with the lavender and the peach apple cobbler being my favorites. Everyone in my party ordered teas and sandwiches; and everyone was as equally impressed with the quality."
"4.0","We've been here several times since it's really close to where we live and I've been impressed every time. The pickle-brined chicken might be my favorite, it's massive and super flavorful. When ordering a burger, it's always cooked perfectly. Their roasted garlic dressing is really fantastic too!"
"4.0","I went here again it's one of my favorite seafood places.Last time I had a hot lobster roll covered in lobster bisque. Thus time I tried the cold lobster roll with fries and the lobster bisque on the side.My bisque was good and my lobster roll was refreshing and cold. I got to sit outside and each table had pretty flowers.A definite place to try if you love seafood."
"4.0","This is definitely one of the better Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh.  However, don't venture off the beaten path.  I normally get the Pad Thai or Pad Siew dishes and they're awesome (with generous portion) but the last time I went I got Thai Fish Cakes, Thai somoza, and a basil noodle dish and I did not enjoy anything.  Keep it mainstream and you will be fine.  Don't order anything too unfamiliar."
"3.0","10pm-2am   best pizza of my pittsburgh life6pm-10pm   pour garlic powder generously and its still good.at any hour, the guys that work there are some of the nicest people I've met in oakland.tip: ask them to cut the pizza into just two pieces, cover it in garlic powder, then eat it like there's no tomorrow."
"5.0","Got to be one of the best pizza's in Pittsburgh. They make the pizzas right in front of you and for 6$ you get a huge pizza and the toppings are 1.5$ . We usually got two toppings and the bread and cheese are an absolute delight..Highly recommended for lovers of thin crust pizzas.The only inconvenience is they don't have a place to sit anywhere close, so you need to go either to the UPitt canteen place which have a few seats outside or to the park to have a nice view along with the meal..."
"4.0","THE  CHARCUTERIE BOARD IS SO GOOD!!! Absolutely love it! We have gone and share it as a meal that's how delicious it is. Other things I like here? Just about everything! The Parmesan and pepper pizza is really good and I also really like the goat cheese ravioli. If you're going to the theater or looking to hang out with friends for dinner after work this is a nice choice for anyone who happens to be downtown.Never had a bad experience."
"4.0","I come here about 1-2 times a month for a generous portion of chicken and rice.  There are typically 3-4 different chicken dishes here.  That's usually what I stick with...,the chicken options.  They also have a beef or lamb option.  The order goes like this:-go up to the counter and point at what you want-that's it!The guys serving you at the counter will throw in whatever you want and mix and match to your liking.  The basic order is a main meat option, rice, and your choice of salad or vegetable.  The mixed veggie option is good!  I am not a fan of the desserts here.  They aren't sweet enough for me...Friendly service, reasonable prices, get it to go.., otherwise you can sit and eat in the cafeteria style dining they have here.  Personally, I prefer eating at home in front of the TV.  Oh and the building was painted up last summer and it looks cool.  One more thing- they have a market here now too.  Haven't checked it out but will soon..."
"4.0","This is a pretty good quality Indian. I didn't have the buffet but I ordered off the menu. I had the lamb vindaloo with an onion kulcha, the vindaloo was spicy and sour as I expected."
"3.0","The food and atmosphere was great! But, they only had 2 servers that also doubled as host and cashier.. Maybe someone had called off of work making them short, but the service time wasn't great. Would be back if they had more staff."
"4.0","What a great find. Our party of six, each had a different entree and no one was disappointed. Yummy appetizers, smoked Gouda , jalepeno poppers, and mussels ( very tasty but sadly too small) We're always happy to find a BYOB restaurant with awesome food. Sausalido fits the bill ."
"5.0","I ABSOLUTELY love this place. The lines may be long but it is sure worth it. Food is ALWAYS fresh, customer service is ALWAYS top notch, prices are fir, you get a ton of food. Friendly environment, diverse crowd. Clean eating. You guys  R O C K !"
"5.0","Yelp brought us here with its great reviews and so glad we came! Looking for something delicious and fairly quick. Enjoyed pineapple upside down cake while our Build Our Own Sandwiches and Avocado Toast were made. Definitely these people know what they are doing and we are experienced diners, ha! Will surely be back without a doubt."
"5.0","I have not been or seen a Hardee's in over 40 years.Growing up as a kid there where a McDonald's and a Hardee's next to each other down the block from my house.I spent all my time at Hardee's as I loved the food.Since I have not had Hardee's in over 40 years I did not know what to expect.I ordered 2 hamburgers with extra pickle and a fry no salt.The staff where fast and friendly.The hamburgers and fries where as good as I remember them being.Hardee's burgers and fries blows away the competition McDonald's and burger king and all the rest.Hardee's burgers have such a better taste than Mcdonald's now I will be spoiled and have too make that extra drive back too Hardee's.The only negative point between Hardees and the rest of the fast food places is that Hardee's was a bit more expensive than the others.I am willing too pay a little more for much better quality and taste.You can be sure I will be back to Hardee's over and over again"
"1.0","We just moved to Pittsburgh from LA, as in arrived this afternoon. I looked up places to eat our first Pittsburgh dinner and settled on Sausalido. We were really excited to eat here!  When we (3 people; not a large group) arrived the restaurant, there were people taking up approximately 4 tables with numerous tables open. Despite the apparent availability, we were rudely told (by the hostess) that the wait was 25min. When we confusingly asked why there was such a long wait, we again were rudely told 'the wait is 25min' and no other explanation. So we left, went down the street, and settled in elsewhere. Even as we left, no one said a word to us. I can't believe the lack of customer service and rude treatment from the hostess. Never coming back here."
"5.0","THE BEST tacos around. There is not much to them, yet they are so flavorful and fresh. My favorite tacos are the shrimp with everything on them, of course. We became Edgar fans when he was on the street up from Pamela's Diner. It was almost the perfect location, since every time we would enter the strip we would walk past and buy our obligatory tacos. When we realized he relocated, we were disappointed at first, but we learned that he has a closer location on Penn Ave and one that's further down the strip on 26th street. The workers are friendly and accommodating and his newer location has a sign out front saying they now cater (I don't remember this at the last location). I'm so happy they are expanding and look forward to many more taco stops this summer."
"5.0","I don't even live in Pittsburgh but anytime we are on a road-trip and Pittsburgh is along Route... we take a two hour detour just for Salem's Grill! The chicken burger is best I've ever had. The meat curry and and their spinach is another must try! We wish they had market like this in every state!"
"2.0","We wanted try this place due to the Bettis factor and seating by the water. The view was nice and there was no wait on a Friday night at 630pm. The waitress was nice and attentive. We had the pretzel breadsticks, beer, and mixed drink. The food was hot and fresh. I thought $9.50 for a small Jack/Coke was bit much. The biggest concern that I had with the experience was the men's restroom. There was a one way window while standing at the urinal that allowed you to watch the bar area, but people obviously couldn't see in. Seriously?.. what's the purpose?.. I wasn't impressed."
"2.0","After reading all the reviews about Luke Wholey's Wild Alaskan Grille On Yelp I had to check it out for myself. I had the salmon dinner and it wasn't as good as I thought it should have been. Maybe it was a bad day for the cook, but I'll pass on going back."
"4.0","Really solid place. Expect small portions and not the massive rolls you typically see. It's very good and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly. Great cocktails, too."
"4.0","Cafe Phipps has some of the best food in walking distance of CMU's campus. We take many of our visitors here for lunch.It is nearly impossible to have an unhealthy or bad tasting meal here. They serve delicious, healthy, organic, local, and fresh ingredients. The menu consists of sandwiches, salads, and soups, and you can get combinations of those. There are vegan options and gluten-free options. For someone with allergies who is trying to eat healthy, it's a dream come true. Don't be afraid to try something new--they get it right here--from quinoa pasta to vegan sandwiches.They even have a children's menu! The side dishes: a small serving of a fruit AND a veggie. A mom's dream!Great atmosphere. Clean, modern, hip. Living plants on every table. They even encourage composting and recycling such that finding an actual 'trash' can is nearly impossible."
"5.0","The best chinese I have had in Pittsburgh, staff was friendly , it was super speedy like most chinese restaurants but worth the wait!!!"
"3.0","I believe that Thai Cusine which is just 2 blocks away beats out Thai Gourmet. Although I really love the mom and pop vibe of this restaurant, I think they use a little too much sugar in a lot of their dishes. I am a huge fan of Tom kha and use it as a standard by which to compare Thai restaurants but unfortunately the tom kha here tastes overwhelmingly of sugar. It could definitely benefit from more fish sauce and lime juice.The other complaint is that the prices are a bit steep for the area. Dinner for two is around $50 for an app and two entrees but youd have to bring your own beer. Still, I think Thai Gourmet is a good place to have around during times when Nicky's isn't open but it is a pretty average restaurant for me."
"1.0","Horrible service. Dirty plates. Wrong orders. Waiter came off like he didn't care. Tv's were broken and there was spilled food on the floor that they just stepped over instead of cleaning."
"5.0","Super cool and hip joint. Ive been here a few different times and I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered. Their food and drinks are both super tasty and unique! It's a place I always keep in my back pocket for when friends or family visit from out of town. I highly recommend it!!"
"4.0","Went here for the first time today with my family since we have heard that it's a Pittsburgh staple. We didn't know what to expect and we knew ahead of time that it's cash only which is no big deal since there's an ATM right around the corner from the restaurant and up and down the street basically.We didn't wait to long, their waiting room/hostess could be a little more welcoming though.The space looks crowded and you're a bit overwhelmed when you first walk in but when you sit down you realize that the tables are actually spread apart enough that you don't feel too crowded. Each table has enough distance that you feel comfortable and you can talk with the people at your table.The waitress was nice and we got our food very quickly.  So the service was fast and attentive.  And the food was delicious! We got the Morning after Breakfast Special and it was so good. We all ate everything off our plates. I would've ordered another side of the Lyonnaise potatoes if I wasn't so full from all the yummy food.The only beef I have about the restaurant was that the waitress basically put the check on our table without telling us.  We found it under one of our glasses on the table.  She never announced it and also she never showed up at our table after that. And that was right at the beginning of our meal.  My family wanted more coffee and drinks but she never showed up.  All in all, the food is great, I definitely recommend going there.  But the service could be a little better. I felt like we got there, got our food and then they wanted us out asap."
"3.0","Thai Gourmet is a bomb spot for lunch. $6 and some change gets you a spring roll, cup of soup and an entree large enough to fill your gut three times over (note, no lunch deal on weekends). I always skip the soup (I think it's disgusting). When you do that, they give you two spring rolls (yes!). The spring rolls are usually cold and relatively hollow, but I kind-of love them anyway. The Nam Prik is my favorite entree choice, though it is among the least healthy of things I am willing to eat in this world. Greasy tempura and loads of delicious tofu served with an ultra rich spicy peanutty sauce and a sad pale side salad. The portion size is seriously gigantic. Other decent entree choices I've tried include Japanese Eggplant and the Pad Kee Mao. I usually leave here feeling like I am going to explode, with leftovers enough to revive that sensation two more times.They *seem to be fully understanding of the vegan concept when I ask for no egg and no fish sauce. For dinner, or on a Saturday, you pay more money for less food, meh. Spice level of 10 is not as scary as it should be."
"5.0","Love this restaurant! It's the most authentic place I've found after taking a long trip to Tokyo. The robatayaki skewers are amazing, especially the trumpet mushroom. The server said her favorite was the corn which I'll have to try next. The menu has nice variety and you can have a light, medium, or heavy meal. The chirashi and ramen are my favorite for full meals. Service is consistently good and the atmosphere is very cool.Note- it is a small restaurant and gets loud, so if you have trouble hearing in loud places or trouble projecting, that might be tough. The seats near the windows definitely get cold. Also, it's not ADA accessible- there are 2 flights of steep stairs."
"3.0","The food itself was good but I wouldn't get the oysters. I had a business lunch here today and about 5 hours later puked my guts out"

"1.0","I have never written a review on Yelp before. Never compelled to do so, but could not share about my experience at Mezzo. Awful. Took my husband and father out for Father's Day. Couldn't have had a worse experience. The restaurant is the middle section of a three tiered 'open warehouse' type atmosphere. Which equates to a balmy room with little circulation. The waiter was very nice, but service timing was horribly slow. Long time for drink orders and waited a long time for bad tasting food to come out. I ordered a margherita pizza for my kids and added bacon for them for an extra $2 and came out with barely a slice of undercooked bacon, which I took off bc didn't want my kids eating it.  Calamari was tasteless. Gnocchi was good. I had a $32 tuna which was over cooked and insanely salty. For that price, I assumed it was ahi Tuna and it wasn't. It also came with some black weird tasteless spongy cakes.  I couldn't really complain about my meal since my husband and father both had the Seafood pasta. They were both so dissatisfied that they needed to return the dishes. It was with a red sauce with indiscernible pieces of seafood slop. The waiter knowing that we were dissatisfied, spoke with the manager, offered them to make them another dish for which we had to wait another 15-20 minutes for. At this point, my kids kept saying Mommy why aren't we leaving yet. Waiter said manager comped us our few drinks from our tab, but NEVER had to decency to come speak with us ourselves. Which was probably the most annoying part of it all. The attempt for customer service recovered was non-existent and they seemed as though they didn't care. I have a degree in Hospitality so I know how these situations needed to be handled and some management or someone other than our server should have spoken with us. I go out to eat all the time in Pittsburgh and I was so disappointed that I failed my husband and dad for Father's Day and had to spend $200 to do so for my party of 4 adults and 2 kids (that had a $20 pizza)"
"5.0","Mr Bulgogi was located outside of Biddle's Escape this evening. We were dying to try it out since we have never had it before. Staff were so friendly! I ordered the spicy pork bowl and my hubby got the half and half bowl which was half spicy pork and half bulgogi beef. We ordered the chicken dumplings for my daughter and the guy taking the orders asked us if it was for a child. When we said yes he added rice and a water with it. No extra charge! They had single foil sheets sitting out to make it easy to cover your food and take it to go. My pork was great! Zero complaints and there were 2 dumplings included with the bowls. My hubby said the beef was spicy but still really good. There was not a long wait time once you ordered. Really everything was perfect. We will be back!"
"2.0","The girl at the reception was unfriendly and did't let us choose some unreserved bar seats. We were told to seat at the bar corner. However, she apparently let a couple right after us to seat there. The service and food are good."
"5.0","They were open on 4th of July and they served as great as it gets! Southern style omelet is my new favorite besides the Nutella one :) The dish comes with fresh cut fruits, toasted bread on the side. definitely, recommend to anyone! Keep up with the great work!"
"3.0","I was looking forward to trying this restaurant.  I am in Bloomfield frequently but rarely get to try the restaurants in the area.  I was really excited to have a date night with my hubby here last Friday.  We made a reservation, which was good.  It was pretty crowded. It is a BYOB, which is my favorite!  2$ cork fee per person, is totally worth it!  We were sat right away and had a great server.  She was very smiley and helpful.  The restaurant is not too small, but it is a nice intimate size.  The server brought us some really yummy white bean dip.  It was my favorite part of the meal!  The dip had a nice olive oil on top and a sweet balsamic also.  It was delicious!  So I was just a little disappointed by my meal.  I got the gnocchi which is one of my favorite pastas!  The pasta was cooked well, not too 'gummy.'  The sauce was.....well underwhelming.  It was ok.  I had to season it, because it really didnt have enough salt and pepper on it.  My husband got the duck.  He was also underwhelmed with his dinner.  His potatoes were under seasoned and the duck was VERY fatty.  (More than duck at most restaurants)  I would definitely give this place another try, because so many people seem to like it.  Maybe we caught it on an off night?"
"1.0","I used to frequent this regularly, until I moved out of town.  I came back and was very disappointed with the service I received today.  When the waitress finally made it to the table she gave the impression she did not want to wait on us. When we were able to order, it seemed like it took forever to get the food.  The place was pretty empty, so that could not be the reason.  I ordered a slice of pie for dessert, and that took over 10 minutes for the pie to arrive.  I also had to ask to get my water refilled, which again took about 10 minutes.  Then when we paid the cashier, she shorted us $10.  I guess I should have counted the change before I left.  I doubt I will ever go back here again."
"5.0","I always knew this place was good for ice cream but have you tried the breakfast food  one dayme and my boyfriend Second time there and we got breakfast food this time, he ordered waffles with sausage, hash browns, & eggs, I got a breakfast burrito. My boyfriend loved his food and especially his eggs because he's a texture kinda guy and I loved my breakfast burrito  my favorite part was the hash browns, they where perfect we will highly recommend to my friends."
"5.0","My favorite part of the almost daily trip to the Strip District, Salem's has great tasting food, fast, and inexpensive.  Lamb shank and chops, kebabs, kufta, biryani, samosas, shawarma, and plenty of vegan dishes too.  A must try next time you are in the neighborhood."
"4.0","Stopped by here today for their Oakland Restaurant Week lunch special: $6 for one trip (one plate) to the lunch buffet and drinks cost extra. Dine-in only!! I've always wanted to try this place and I finally chose today to do it.I came in around 2:00 and it was 3/4 empty, so I was seated and received my water really quickly. The server was really nice and courteous. The food was really good! The lunch buffet selection is small, but they had all the popular dishes. All of the curries were really delicious and flavorful. The rice was cooked really well. The veggie pakora (?) was old/over-fried because it was hard and really dry. And there was only one piece of naan bread left when I went up (which was also hard and dry), which was really disappointing because naan is my favorite part of Indian food but I didn't want to bother waiting for it to come out and/or possibly getting in trouble because I was only allowed a trip.All in all, I think the food is really good but I don't think the restaurant week special was really that worth it. For a few bucks more you can do all-you-can-eat option with a drink included and a discount if you're a student or UPMC employee. I would definitely like to come here again in the future."
"4.0","I had come to tamarind for a lunch buffet with some of my friends and we were happy about the experience.The food is a bit spicy and the non-vegetarian dishes were especially good.The service is good and it is not too crowded.Overall a good experience!!"
"3.0","I was looking for something good to eat on my way home from the city. I remembered that I had a Groupon and decided to try out Burgh'ers. I mean, who doesn't love a great burger? It wasn't busy in the restaurant when we arrived. There were only a few people at a few tables, which was great because I was really hungry. However, I have to say that our service was very slow. It took a long time for us to give our order. Then a family of 5 came in much after us and they received their meals before us. My mom and I actually even ordered the same exact thing, so it was a very easy order.Outside of the slow service, the burger was good. I ordered the Forest Hills burger. It had bleu cheese, honey, mushrooms, and mixed greens.  It was cooked well and plated nicely. I also got rosemary fries. There is an upcharge for it, but they were really good.The atmosphere was relaxed. Your typical mixed industrial feel. There were big TVs over the bar area and it has an open kitchen. I would try out the restaurant again. The food was good enough for a return visit."
"4.0","Yum! Cool, modern fast casual restaurant in Oakland. To start off, I love the look of the place - crisp and clean. Second, I love the menu - clear and concise. Third, the service was speedy. Finally, the food was good! My husband ordered the hot chicken sandwich which was delicious but FAR to hot for me. I ordered the chicken salad at medium heat. The chicken was crispy and flavorful and the salad was super fresh. I loved the green beans. We will be back!"
"2.0","Very disappointing, women who took our order was rude, almost as if she was annoyed and did not want to work. We got a chicken sandwich(very dry) our fries tasted old. I'm so disappointed cause the pictures look delicious! Better luck next time. Ps. Please hire people who have customer service."
"4.0","Each time I go here, I very rarely have complaints. The service is quick, the food is good, and the employees are pleasant. This is one of my go-to places for a meeting, because I know it will be quick and provide ample space to meet. It can get pretty cramped in here, but it all depends on the day and time. There is a private room available in this Panera location."
"3.0","Good food and good service.  My only complaint is that when you order the Chicken Curry dish off of the menu the portion of chicken is nearly not existent. It comes in a tiny little bowl filled with curry sauce and  6 - 7 very small pieces of chicken bits.  The Curry Chicken portion doesn't even amount to the size of a small chicken breast but it is good & tasty. Not worth the money though!!!!!"
"3.0","Came in and as the other reviews said it's kind of dingy. I really was craving corned beef and have been wanting to try this place for a while. The waitstaff is rude. There are no signs of where to order so I asked the bartender and he shoveled me towards the back. I found the spot where they make the sandwiches and ordered the corned beef. I asked the next lady I wanted everything on it and to go. They do take credit cards to my surprise. Even Amex hahaI have to say my sandwich is quite delicious. The corned beef is quite good and the bread is soft. It came with a pickle that was huge! For around $6 bucks I really can't complain. I'll call this place a little hidden gem."
"3.0","Such a cool bar, I was not really happy with the quality of the drinks and the appetizers (the dumplings) were terrible. I was so hopeful that this would become my new watering hole. As I said the space alone is amazing. Just because of the ambiance i'm willing to give it another shot. I wish I could have said better things since this seems to be such a slam dunk for everyone else. Planing on attending the music trivia nights sometime soon. Hopeful that will leave me whistling a different tune."
"4.0","This place was great! We had several different dishes, but the chorizo hash was the winner. Expect a bit of a wait, but it's worth it."
"1.0","We had an absolutely horrific customer experience at Mezzo. I consider myself someone who dines out quite often. Upon arrival (we had a reservation) and asked if we could be seated by the windows as it was a special occasion for my sister's bachelorette party. Despite having multitudes of open tables by the windows we were told no that they had other reservations. The server that came to our table appeared annoyed with our presence even being there. I requested a beer off of the menu and was told that they were out of it. My sister requested a Bloody Mary, no can do. What kind of bar can't make a Bloody Mary? I've never heard of this in my life. We were then advised that we had an hour and a half time limit at our table. This specifically is what caused me to write this review. I have never in my life been told I have a time limit at a dining establishment. Not only is this a classless statement it is also one of the most inhospitable I have every experienced. Lastly, after ordering our entrees, a member of the bridal party approached the bar to order shots. She was told no to every kind she suggested and actually insulted being told the shots she was asking for were from 1980 disparaging our age group. Again, what kind of hospitality is this? She ended up going downstairs to get the shots where they were much more accommodating. I will say the food was excellent and the hostess was kind in offering friends of ours who joined us a table nearby for drinks. I am not sure that I will ever be back as the lack of customer service overshadowed any joy we had. I highly recommend counseling your staff. They are lacking in many ways."
"5.0","Was able to stop in while nannying on Monday with the 3 boys that I watch and the employees were the best I have encountered in the South Side.  The counter girl, I believe Carrie talked with the boys about their toy cars and did not seem bothered by there million questions while helping all the customers in the line and the cook was efficient taking care of not only our order but everyone else in the restaurant.  Thank You for making our 1st time visiting the best we could ask for! It is not too often you find employees that have smiles on their faces and still show care for the customers and these two definitely did. And the boys give thumbs up for the tacos!"
"5.0","we had a great breakfast.  the strawberry hotcakes were awesome here. every bit of them was delicious!we also had the tex mex omlette and the 2 eggs.  the tex mex was very tasy and the guac was good compared to some diner guac.  the potatoes they make are also tasty.  get them over all the other breakfast sides."
"5.0","I have eaten here twice so far and both times had a great experience.  I can not speak for the buffet but ordering from the menu the food was very good.  Surprisingly empty both times I went so the service was great as well. The food was definitely a little less spicy then I was expecting but not a bad thing. I recommend the chai tea, it is fantastic."
"2.0","Weak taco game. The beef is tasteless. So sad when a proper asada isn't that hard. Flour tortillas are a joke, just like the lettuce and cheese.  I'd only say the pork is close to ok but the rest is far off from decent Mexican or Mexican American and at the end of they day they are asking for tips with 20% min for what is a fast food counter.Maybe the decor only keeps it above 1 star"
"5.0","The sandwiches here are amazing. I had the hammertime (ham & Gouda on a croissant) and my friend had the happy turkey club. Both sandwiches were deliciously carved, thick slices. Not a pile of thin slices. I can't wait to go back and try the roast beef with horseradish! The venue is spacious with nice food furniture. There is a communal loungy area that would be good for an casual lunch group."
"4.0","I had the pleasure of eating at Sausalido during restaurant week. From their pre fix menu, I ordered the Sicilian meatballs, mixed greens salad, and roasted kale risotto. For the amount and quality of food that I got, the $25.14 dinner was definitely worth it. Since Sausalido proclaims itself as an Italian restaurant, I wanted to try their version of a risotto. I do not know if restaurants are starting to this recently, but  I could tell that the rice in the risotto had been par-cooked and then added to the sauce. I do understand that it is time-consuming to make risotto but I was disappointed that an Italian restaurant would take this shortcut. Overall, I would definitely go back to Sausalido and try their other dishes."
"5.0","Delicious and fast delivery! Only took 25 minutes to deliver. We ordered the breadsticks, breaded zucchini, and buffalo chicken tenders. The chicken tenders had just the right amount of spice and were very crispy. The breadsticks are huge and came with 10 which was great for the price! Made our night in very tasty:)"
"3.0","This place was hyped-up by my boyfriend, so I had high expectations.  Our appetizer and salads were great.  Even the bread with the white bean paste.  However, once our entree's came, I was pretty dissapointed.  I got the Monkfish special.  There was just way too much going on, and the entire dish was in some sort of sauce that made everything soggy.  My boyfriend got the flank steak, which he said was great.  Maybe I would have had a better experience with a different entree.  Overall, I think this place is overpriced.  You can get better food at a better value other places in the city."
"3.0","Came in for a birthday dinner. We made reservations and glad we did. Arriving at 7:15, the place was packed. We were quickly seated and a waiter saw our wine bottle (it's BYOB) and opened it for us.We ordered the prosciutto pickle spears. Hubs wanted the tuna and I opted for the crab cakes, but alas no tuna was available. Hubs wanted risotto, so I swapped for the duck so he could get the crab cakes. All is well in the world again.Bread, with bean dip and balsamic arrives. It's an interesting option and we enjoyed it. The prosciutto pickle spears arrive and we were surprised to see full pickles. We had imagine the little pickles. As such, the prosciutto was overpowered by the pickle. It was still tasty, but not something I could have a lot of. The salads arrive and is a good mix of lettuce, tomato, cucumber, salad, and chickpeas. I didn't realize we were getting salads with the meals and I would have specified dry. Not a fan of oil or dressing on salads. I made do.We finished the salads and wait. Our entrees are taking a bit. Hubs go to the restroom and overhears a manager yelling at the kitchen staff that he needs those crab cakes out now. Now we know the hang up and why others who came after us got their entrees first. They could have told us and we could have ordered something else, but no one did. At this point, we're almost finished with our bottle of wine. We preserve the final glass for the entrees. When they came, the crab cakes were sizable and with good flavor. The duck was good, but fatty. There was little meat, leaving me a bit hungry, so I stole some crab cake. The risotto was underwhelming and not cooked well. It tasted like standard rice and not the care required in slow cooking risotto.As we were wrapping up, the waitress offers a dessert since it's a birthday dinner. I opted for the flourless chocolate cake. It's dense and tasty. Perfect way to cap it off.We were hoping to head out as it is now 9:40. We've been there for while. The waitress is talking to other guests for 10 minutes, so we were waiting again to get the check. It's a swift process and we head out. The food is good, with plenty of options. The service was spotty and we weren't sure what to make of it. They were friendly, but we didn't get the wait and such."
"1.0","I don't understand why this place is popular. The food is ok, it's edible. Most is freezer fare and bland. I imagine the price is the draw but there are plenty of mom and pop places in the same price range with better quality. I've had a wide variety of everything and if you're looking for a McDonald's sit down type restaurant you'll like it. If you're looking for homemade fare don't visit. The salad bar is ok but the salad dressings are not very good aside from the blue cheese. The breakfast buffet is edible not great not terrible. Dennys and IHOP are better choices if you're looking for cheaper chain food. You'd do better by visiting non chain places close by like Blinkys or Coachs."
"4.0","My friend suggested going to Pamela's for brunch when I was visiting by saying 'Obama comes here when he's in town', so I was obviously game since hey, if it's good enough for the President... There was a bit of a wait when we arrived at 10:30, which is to be expected on the weekends. When we were finally seated in about half an hour, we decided to share the chocolate chip banana hotcakes, Gail's Famous Eggs, and a side of bacon. I also ordered a small orange juice, which I would recommend steering clear from. A small cup is big enough for a 3 year old and the orange juice tasted like 80% tap water, 20% orange juice concentrate. The food came out really fast, which was great since we were starving after waiting for a bit to be seated. I thought both plates were really delicious! The hot cakes were definitely a mix of a crepe and a pancake since the edges are thin and crispy and the middle was thicker and softer. Loved the bananas, chocolate chips, and whipped cream filling and really appreciated that they split the dish onto 2 plates for us. The eggs were also really good, but I wish the cream cheese was softer since it was difficult to spread on the eggs. We requested extra crispy Lyonnaise potatoes, which I would highly recommend since I prefer crispy potatoes to mushy ones. I would not recommend ordering the bacon unless you just want a bacon taste in your mouth since the bacon is paper thin, greasy, and not very satisfying.Overall, I thought everything was really tasty and a great spot for breakfast/brunch, especially if you have any visiting friends or family!"
"1.0","Was less than impressed with Redbeard on 6th. The waitress took our order, brought the drinks and disappeared. After asking my husband how he was enjoying the nachos, he told her that he wasn't really. She told him that they weren't known for the nachos. After a while, i had to ask another server for our check. Mind you, there was only one other table occupied. After getting the check, we continued to wait to cash out. I finally got up to go pay. There was a bartender, two people at a table wrapping flatware and a waitress watching the pre-interviews of a preseason Steeler game, none were paying attention the dining area. I won't be back. Sorry."
"5.0","Let our son pick a place for dinner and he is a big fan of corned beef so he chose Sammy's. The corned beef was seasoned perfectly and served with coleslaw that was fresh and crunchy. I had pastrami and enjoyed it. I would have liked my bread toasted but was caught up looking at the wall of celebrities who had eaten there and didn't know to ask for it. Will definitely come back!"
"4.0","You can't beat an $8 Indian lunch buffet. However only one of the dishes on the buffet has any meat and it was some overcooked chicken. Besides that the mushrooms were excellent and the staff was friendly. I'll definitely be stopping in again someday."
"5.0","Have been here about half dozen times now for Happy Hour. Service is always top notch. Everyone is welcoming. Cocktail menu changes frequently, so be sure to go back and try something new. Also-the mussels are NOT to be missed. And use the toast that is served with them to mop up all the sauce. You're welcome."
"3.0","Cool space with string lights and a retractable roof. We came last night on a gorgeous evening and were disappointed that the roof was closed. It was pretty steamy inside and hard to have a conversation it was so loud. I'll have to come back when the roof top is open and review again. We ordered the signature frozen rose' cocktails and they were super strong, but good."
"5.0","This is one of my favorite places for food in general but today I wanted comfort food so I ordered chicken curry with rice, curried vegetables and chick peas. M-m-m good! The has the right amount of heat and the chicken and veggies are oh so tender. They have a wide variety of choices: burgers, fries, hummus, shawarma, goat and lamb dishes to name a few. The desserts are delicious too! The baklava is one of my favorites! The staff is always friendly and helpful. The market has a wide variety of Mediterranean groceries and the butcher shop has halal meat choices, it's so fresh!"
"4.0","Downtown Pittsburgh is deserted at night, especially on this street.  I was asked if I needed help with directions by a well-dressed stranger steps before entering into Sammy's with my suitcase.  That was sweet.I got off the Amtrak train during the evening and was wandering around the area looking for a quick eat.  Qdoba was closed.  Originally, my plan was to eat here and then head to my hotel but I changed my order into a take-out.  Although only a few seats were occupied, the atmosphere was very heavy and intense.  It was a little too quiet for me.  I felt like I was in a saloon with a fight about to break out any minute.  I walked to the sandwich counter at the back of the bar and ordered the special.  The woman was friendly although she didn't seem to be up for much conversation.  For less than $10 (~$8?), I got a pastrami sandwich on rye with cole slaw on the beef and a pickle on the side.  Damn, the cole slaw was light and the pastrami was very tender and chewy!  I devoured the whole thing.  Definitely worth a trip to Sammy's for this sandwich!"
"5.0","Our parents who have lived in the US for less than a month thought that food was 'lazeez' meaning as tasty as it gets,after eating there like 4 times and trying about 10 different items.We are self doubting when it comes to reviewing Indian restaurants in US--our taste buds have been considerably altered--definitely cant take as much spice as we could 4 years ago.The search for an authentic Indian restaurant, that I don't have to drive 15 miles to get to, is over--THIS IS IT ! recommend--appetizer--gobi manchurian/chilly chicken/samosa/mirch pakora(all are VERY spicy though except samosa) main course--chana/baingan ka bhartha/dosa/kadai paneer --dosa esp is yummy and good if you dont like too much spice.all different breads--naan/roti/paratha--all are awesomedesert--gulab jamun/halwa"
"3.0","This seems like a very family-friendly restaurant. The night we went here for dinner, there were 10 or 11 small children actually running around in circles in the restaurant because apparently monsters were hiding under the tables. This was probably an unusual situation since there was a large group of adults having some sort of a get together and they had all brought their children, however I still think it was cool that the restaurant was willing to allow the children to run around. If you're bothered by noise and screaming children, this might not be the place for you (although as mentioned above it probably doesn't happen that often). However, if you have small children and don't want to have to worry about them running around, it might be a good spot for you.Food wise, it was fairly unremarkable - just your standard Indian food. Not particularly good, but not bad either."
"4.0","Only tried a few things but it was all very good. Fast service too. Nice place, going back for sure."
"5.0","I love their oyster selection! If you're coming to the strip district; keep going past Roland's and eat at Luke Wholey's. The oysters are so fresh and so so so good. They have great drinks, really nice bartenders and super fresh seafood. Everyone is friendly and they provide a personalized experience. Oysters are expensive but you are paying for quality. They aren't orange and fishy like Roland's. They are huge!!! I normally come here just for the oysters. Also have a Bloody Mary, they are so creative with the flavors and the appearance."
"4.0","If your looking for greasy junk food pizza this is the place. Every time I've had the pizza here it's been good. A few beers or whiskeys and this pizza will hit the spot."
"2.0","They had better food with the former owners and now they charge a delivery fee.  Like most places in the Oakland area when you order you never know if you are going to get a hit or a miss.  I used to order the family feast at least once a week and the hoagies were always exceptional but now, you unwrap it and the lettuce is soggy and wilted (and not from the heat of the hoagie), the breadsticks have almost no cheese or garlic salt on them and the pizza is super greasy.  If you decide to pay to have a topping thrown on it, be forewarned that the pepperoni is going to make it even harder to handle.  I'd order from them if I needed something after 1am because they do deliver later on the weekends but outside of that, there are a hundred other places to give your money to that will treat you with a little bit of class when you call and order."
"5.0","Chill and friendly casual vibe.Got the bean stew and one of the 'skillet' omelettes.Both were great."
"4.0","An excellent addition to Bloomfield.  Quality food, nicer atmosphere, without being a bar.  I've been twice, once early when it opened and again more recently.It is BYOB and a very small space.  Cuisine is a mix of California/Mediterranean and menu varies frequently.  We had an amazing appetizer of smoked gouda, we considered licking the plate.The Beets & Bleu Salad - was great.  And I think this was the meal that turned me into a beet lover. For entrees we had the Goat Cheese stuffed chicken and London Broil.  Both were very very good.The owner/manager is great and usually stops by every table.  Services is excellent.  It's a small place, and both times I've been there it hasn't been packed.  We're typically a loud group - so I imagine had it been full - everyone would have been subject to our ridiculous stories.The wine I guzzled at dinner was also excellent - but it's byob - so now I'm just reviewing myself."
"3.0","I am only speaking to having Little Nipper's delivered, I have never been in the restaurant.  The wings are really good and are typically what my husband and I order.  Pizza is also good although (extremely) greasy and with delivery they don't necessarily slice it all the way through.  Also issues with a pizza showing up on which all the toppings had 'slid' to one side.  I assume it was dropped by delivery person or kitchen staff."
"5.0","Some of the best chicken I've ever had.  Open seated dining , beers on tap, can't wait to get back there.  Don't start with the Damn Hot; it will be too hot for most"
"4.0","Great/friendly service. Very impressed. Located right in the heart of the strip district, it's very convenient if you're in the area and need to stop for a bite. The food itself was good. Nothing that really stood out as being amazing but it was good for a semi-reasonable price. Drinks are a bit pricey for the area ($5/bottle domestic beer). I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but if in the area it's not a bad option."
"2.0","Was so excited to get your pizza today. It's been a few months since last order. Very disappointed in the quality of what I got.  Pizza is burnt on 1side not done on other. How sad is this   So not happy. What happened here!!! Used to be the best I've ever had. Now have to settle for second best down the street"
"1.0","I ordered online, two burritos one with bacon one regular vegetarian. They labeled them wrong and pieces of backn were so tiny that it was hard to tell in first few bites. Being a vegetarian it was a horrible experience for me and the on calling them the manager dint do much either. Would never order again"
"4.0","Have been going here for years...  the best eggrolls and homemade duck sauce on the planet.  Soups (Hot and Sour and Wonton) are also excellent - although there is quite a bit of variability to the Hot and Sour.  If I were rating the restaurant solely on soup and egg rolls, Chinatown would deserve a 5, but the meals, to me, are just slightly above average."
"5.0","I went here based on the great Yelp reviews!  I was in a rush, so I really didn't get to take it all in, but I order the chocolate almondine croissant and another one that I haven't even tried yet. It was so good, I felt like I was at a European bakery. Perfectly crispy, flaky, delicious, and buttery. Definitely go here if you're in town and enjoy pastries! Not your average bakery pastries at all. The staff was nice. I also got a chai tea latte. They also gave me my two free treats because I told him that I was there because of Yelp. I kind of want to go back and look at the pastries more carefully they are so beautiful and delicious!"
"5.0","My family's favorite pizza this side of the city and the employees are friendly!  We always order the breadsticks, too, and they're delicious. The owner can often be found working the register and keeping the shop in order.  Highly recommend!"
"4.0","Smallman Galley continues to change it's chefs and now there are two new concepts in the Galley. Sultry opened on June 7th in the spot formerly occupied by Banhmilicious. I got to chat with the couple known as Chef Brian F and Chef Melissa B from various parts of the country.Their concept is Eastern European cuisine.  Chef Brian went over the menu with me. He explained that they are locally sourced. All their meat comes from Goodness grove farm located in Butler, PA. They have on their menu in addition to their regular offerings, gluten free, vegetarian, and certain items can be made vegan upon request. He showed me a chicken pate which is on their 'teaser' list from the farm which could serve as a meal in itself.Upon their recommendation I ordered the chicken schnitzel with pickled garden toppings. The ordering is the usual. Pay and then take a number and they will find your table to serve you. It took a bit of time but I finally got my lunch. It was very good but in some places a little difficult to cut. Still the pickled toppings made it flavorful and the pan jus made it taste better.I asked about their dessert menu. So far all they offer is Kompot which is a homemade juice or a ladylock cup. I went with the latter. Melissa brought it out to me herself. She explained that it is a puff pastry with vanilla Bavarian cream, a berry sauce, and a strawberry crackling on top. Although it appeared huge I was glad that it was a light dessert and not overfilling.  Needless to say it was very good. Sultry is a welcome addition to Smallman Galley. I learned that their tenure will be a year. Parking in the Strip District continues to remain problematic but I usually have no trouble parking in the Cork Factory garage which is a few blocks down. New concept and a great meal to boot!"
"4.0","Was super excited to try this new addition on Forbes Ave. The lunch hour gets super busy, but the line does move quickly. The decor of this place makes it seem nicer than your typical fried food joint. I had the chicken sandwich with fries at a medium level heat. My friend had the hot level and she said it was pretty spicy. Our food came out pretty quickly. The sandwich was HUGE. I am glad, because definitely on the higher end of prices for essentially fast food. The chicken was juicy and crispy and had a nice blend of spices on it. The medium was perfect for me. It had some heat, but did not overpower the chicken. The crinkle cut fries went well with the dipping sauce which was a combo of ketchup, mayo, and spices. Overall, a welcome addition to Oakland. A great place to go if you are craving some fried chicken!"
"5.0","Lunch today was great.  Cool vibe.  My companion had the pesto chicken sandwich and LOVED IT.   Cream cheese on the sandwich was just crazy good.  A Philly caprese sandwich.   Other friend has the Bloomfield burger.  Said the meat was really good.   I had the Veggie burger - vegan and gluten free. (Often this stuff is good for you but bland).  But this had a fresh pickled onion and mojo sauce that really pulled it together -- so great place."
"4.0","There seems to be many negative reviews here, but it was not our experience.  We had a very nice meal there.  The service was good, the food was good, portions were generous, presentation better than expected and prices were good.  The restaurant is small and there isn't much decor-wise (you're kinda right on the street).  Additionally the BYOB is nice.  You can enjoy a nice bottle of wine and not have to pay a triple price.There are a few minor negatives.  1) city parking, 2) tables are a little close (even for a small place) and 3) wait staff needs a little more training.We  will definitely return."
"1.0","Went there today after the Pirates baseball game. Ordered the wings appetizer. They were slathered in gooey BBQ sauce to make up for the extremely dry chicken. The chips & queso tasted like the chips were purchased from the 99 cent store. Stale and tasteless. The queso was thick and gooey instead of creamy. My brother-in-law ordered a 2nd beer that took 15 minutes to arrive. I ordered a refill for my Diet Pepsi and she brought it back without ice (??). My sesame chicken salad was fairly good, but the dressing was too thick, sour/tangy and tasted store bought. We ordered a dessert to share at the table among the four of us, but we couldn't pass the dessert around because the server never removed our finished plates from the table. We had to stack them high in the center of the table. The server was nice, but did not seem very well trained. I would not recommend this place at all."
"1.0","If I could give them negative stars I would. They sat us and we waited for 20 mins...and still no one had taken our order or even acknowledged us. I eventually went to the bar to see if a waiter or waitress could come over and the bartender told me we wouldn't be getting a waiter so we had to just order from her. It was absolutely ridiculous. Several tables around us were getting served so there is no reason they should have sat us without a waiter accessible. The food looked disgusting anyways so we ended up just leaving."
"5.0","Amazing traditional Venezuelan street food!! Every time I go (which is weekly) the food gets better and better. It really takes me back to growing up in Caracas and the delicious food!! Try the arepita pabell√≥n which is the traditional meal of Venezuela."
"5.0","This place is awesome! Almost everyday for lunch I've been working my way through the menu and have loved everything so far!! These are a good group of people! Always happy to interact and make the customers satisfied! And the late night delivery is sweet."
"4.0","Service is awesome and fast! Food is delicious, I got the Forest Hills since it's where my parents live (ha!) and I was hardly disappointed. I've never had honey on my burger before but it was completely done correctly. The side salad of mixed greens was also fresh and tasty. My friend had the pickle chicken and that blew my mind as well, unbelievably good. Never had it before then. Report of my friend is that the house beer was pretty good and the stout she tried (there are many) was surprisingly tasty. Definitely seems like an amazing place for a good beer just from looking around. The biggest downside of this place is the volume, literally it's hard to hear yourself think, so this really isn't a good spot for a date or even really catching up with friends butttt if you want a stiff drink with a novel 'burgers by neighborhood' theme in a fun space with friendly and attentive staff, then this place is worth checking out!"
"1.0","I ordered online. Great idea to save time right? Wrong. The estimated wait time was 45 minutes and it ended up being over an hour and a half. I called after 45 minutes to get an update and I was told the pizza was on its way with no explanation as to why. Another 45 minutes go by and I call again. No response. I call ten more times with no response. Finally, I get an answer. I'm told that the pizza is late because two drivers called off. This would be understandable if I had been told about it an hour ago. They offered me a free 2-liter to make up for it, which was nowhere near appropriate compensation. I will be taking my business elsewhere."
"5.0","I live right down the street and would like to say that this is one of the best kept secrets in the burgh! Not only are the drinks delicious but the food is awesome for quick bites while you're hanging with friends playing games. Would recommend to anyone 21+!"
"3.0","I had the opportunity to dine there for restaurant week and was disappointed to say the least. The drinks were very pricey... I ordered Tito's and tonic..$14!!! We were sat in the booths by the front door which were freezing... I said to the hostess I'm cold and she said the other tables were for larger parties. First impression that we were not regular customers and were treated as such.I gave 3 stars because our waiter James was excellent!! He explained the whole menu and we did some of the upgrades. I ordered an 18 oz bone in Kona strip.. med rare... it was cold. It was difficult to cut also. I've had good steaks before and my sons 14 oz strip also was not tender. The sides were also cold. The desserts were very good. I definitely would not go back based on my experience... Hyde Park is much much better!!!"
"4.0","Great food but somewhat noisy and slow service.I would definitely come back and order the bloody mary."
"5.0","We loved this place! This restaurant is a great addition to all the great businesses in Lawrenceville! This place reeks of pittsburgh with the black and gold chairs, toilets, wall art, and menu. Most of there burgers are named after areas in pittsburgh (shadyside, Lawrenceville, strip district...). We bought Lawrenceville (a burger with mayonnaise and a pierogi), and shady side (with honey and other ingredients). Both were amazing, and the fries they came with were great. The staff was friendly, and it was spotless. My favorite part was the restrooms. The toilets and sinks were black and gold. This restaurant dedicates itself to the town. I would highly recommend you visit this place!"
"2.0","Terrible service. Hostess takes us to our table but does not give us menus.  Server finally decides to show up and asks if we are ready to order LOL.  Um maybe if we had menus. Then the menu we get have old items in them that you can't order.  Server doesn't know why they don't have new ones.  It's been this way for a long time.  Nice. I order a chocolate martini with whipped cream. Drink was good but the whipped cream is 'flat' by the time I get it. Takes forever to get our meals.  Another table saw how ticked off we were getting (same thing happened to them) that they grabbed the manager on their way out. Pasta with shrimp was just ok.  Shrimp was good size where my husband had shrimp Alfredo and they basically gave him salad shrimp.  We complained (which I hate doing but they were the same price !!). They took his off the bill."
"5.0","Delicious breakfast menu in generous portions.  Loved the crepe style hotcakes filled with fresh strawberries or blueberries.   Excellent friendly service."
"1.0","I was here with some friends a couple of weeks ago. I found the place to be very dirty, and somewhat disorganized. We were made to sit right next to the door leading to the kitchen and the restrooms. It was very busy, loud and disturbing area, with too many people moving around. There were flies around where we were sitting, and one of them walked all over my cup, and fell in the cup of my friend. Then, they brought a new cup of water, but with no ice. When I asked for them to add some ice to it, they basically filled it up with ice, with barely any water left. After they took the order, it took them almost half hour to bring the order out. They didn't bring everything together. One of my friends, who ordered or a paper dosa, had to wait another 10 min or so, and it was served cold. Since they are understaffed, there were no waiters to check on us to see if we needed water, or anything else, or whether the food tasted fine. The dosas were ok. Nothing to make them stand out. Also, the curry (masala) was served on the side at an extra price....to me that's penny pinching. I look for an authentic experience when going to Indian places, and this was far from one. And the filth, and flies, and level of service made the whole experience an utter disappointment. I would give them 0 stars, if not for the system expecting me to give them one star."
"5.0","When your down the strip on a Saturday or Sunday you gotta experience the Bloody Mary they serve , shrimp bacon or a soft shell crab , it is awesome The lobster roll was fantastic with lobster bisque on it also"
"4.0","We enjoy ordering for take out from Rialto occasionally, it's location is really convenient to our home. They have a decent amount of seating if you wanted to stay and eat there. Our go to menu item is the XL pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms, they don't skimp on the toppings! They do however charge per topping which can add up. The staff is friendly and helpful. There is a sign out front that says 'best soft serve ice cream', I'd skip the soft serve here and stick with the pizza. Overall, if you're looking for good pizza, Rialto won't disappoint. Plus unlike some of the other pizza places around the area they take credit cards which is nice!"
"2.0","The last two times I have dined at Capital Grille's Pittsburgh location I have been rather disappointed with my meal, and this past time, not only was my meal horrible but the service was inexcusable especially at this price point. We came for a birthday celebration and it also happened to be restaurant week. Receiving our waters was by far the fastest and friendliest service of the night, mind you this person was not our server. our actual server eventually brought out our bottle of wine, a Malbec, which was enjoyed by all. All five of us ended up ordering the RW menu. The appetizer choices were: clam chowder, wedge with blue cheese and bacon, or Caesar salad. The Caesar salad was my choice and, unfortunately besides dessert, was the highlight of the meal. Oh, and the Asiago/onion bread. Those two items tied for second best of the night. For entrees, I chose the 8 oz. filet medium rare. Others in my party chose the krona crusted ribeye for an extra $10. Our server did not deliver our food or check on us at any point. Upon cutting my steak, it was rare, not medium rare, and our server was nowhere to be found. My boyfriend ended up stopping another server requesting my steak be returned for extra cooking. Well, when it was brought back out, it was the same exact steak(at this price point I should be given a new one) and it was completely black and charred on the outside yet hardly cooked any better on the inside. Frankly, it was the worst steak I've ever had and was absolutely disgusting. The 'chef' did bring out new accompaniments- mashed potatoes, which were ok, and green beans, which were flavorless and near raw. Not once did the server stop by and ask if everything was better nor did he ask how anyone else was doing. The server disappeared again for quite sometime and eventually cleared our plates after making multiple passes by us to visit other tables. Dessert- a flourless espresso cake with blackberry sauce- was the best item of the night, though hardly made up for the terrible entree. The fastest service from our server was when he whisked by to pick up the check presenter with credit card (again not a word said as he did so) and return it after it was processed. They did give the birthday boy a nice dessert- cheesecake plus the flourless espresso cake- but, again, does not make up for the service and terrible filet. I'd implore management to retrain this particular server as other tables around us seemed to be receiving smiling service that was at least semi attentive. Since this is the second time I have had a negative experience on some level here, I can say I will not return to this location in the future."
"4.0","First visit to CG and had very pleasant experience. Not a fan of most chain restaurants, especially of the upscale, but CG lived up to its reputation. Had business lunch in a bit of a rush but my grilled salmon over Cesar salad was fresh and delicious. Service was accommodating for our group."
"5.0","The food is so good!! Service is a little slow but the food and drinks are absolutely worth the wait."
"1.0","Well, first of all the people in the back were just simply rude and provided very bad customer service. I ordered a sandwich and instead informing that they didn't have any provolone cheese they just assumed that I wanted asiago cheese and they put it in my sandwich. I never asked for that, I would have like them to tell me that they just didn't have anymore provolone. And, Instead of just making me a new sandwich they just scraped the asiago cheese off my sandwich and brought out the same exact sandwich. The asiago cheese was still on the meat, bread and onions. I was just flabbergasted. I couldn't just finish the sandwich. But the cappuccino was pretty good."
"4.0","Went here on a Saturday night.......really after reading some decent reviews AND because they took reservations. We were taking out my daughter for her birthday along with three others......I didn't want to be hanging out in God knows what type of weather we experience here in April, so that was a plus. We were promptly greeted and seated upstairs in a cozy booth type seating area. This was fine...it allowed us to be as loud as  the wine dictated. Speaking of, it's a BYOB....also a plus for me. We went over board on the apps...they bring out bread and a hummus style dip when you are seated. We tried the smoked Gouda (good but needed to be hotter), the Greek meatballs (our fave) and the crispy cheese bruschetta (good and crunchy fried cheese disks with tomatoes, cheese and herb topping). The meals sampled were the Pork chop (ginormous and juicy) the strip steak (son in law loved it) the crab cakes (daughter said she get that again) the special was a salmon risotto (also huge portion and really good) finally I had the salmon on kale (good, but should have been more adventurous. All in all........good food, good service........will definitely go back."
"5.0","One of the best Italian restaurants I have been to in Pittsburgh. Their gorgonzola basil sauce is to die for and their cannoli are out of this world. They have fresh, soft, delicious, bread and are very good at replenishing the bread basket and water. In addition to the excellent food the service is wonderful! The owners and all the staff are very kind and gave our whole table dessert on the house. Their restaurant is homey yet intimate and I look forward to returning for another tasty meal."
"2.0","Have downsized their pizzas, though not their prices. I have been ordering regularly from them, but now I need to find a new place, because this last experience was not good. They did make their 'Medium' into what used to be 'Small' - so less for the the same price. And when it arrived, it was extremely thin on toppings. Still tasted fine, but clearly a move is on to reduce the value that you get from them."
"4.0","Time to update Fernando's Cafe here!  After having to eat soup yesterday because of an upset tummy, I wanted to have a real sammitch for lunch!  Mmmm!  Hot pastrami and Swiss cheese!  Load that baby up with onions too!  Hey, now we're talkin'!   Fernando's does have some of the best sandwiches Downtown--way better than Subway 'Eat Bland' Sandwiches or Jimmy Johns!"
"4.0","Very nice steak house. Great food and atmosphere... The filet was perfect... I particularly liked the staff... Excellent service without over doing the stuffy formality that tends to be prevelant in better steak houses. Very enjoyable experience."
"4.0","I gave Sausalido a try this past weekend in a last-minute effort to use my Groupon (which expired yesterday! How awesome am I at procrastinating?). I highly suggest making a reservation here if you plan on dining on the weekend, as it not only seriously packs in after 5PM, but often times they don't seat UNLESS you have a reservation.Food here was quite good - our meal started with complimentary bread and white bean dip which was a pleasant surprise (in contrast to the usual stale-bread-and-olive-oil mix). My boyfriend and I shared the sage wheat encrusted gouda appetizer with sun-dried tomatoes and pesto, which was definitely the highlight of our experience. Really, really delicious. The exterior was a crispy breaded layer while the interior was a warm, buttery, melted gouda. To die for!As vegetarians, both my boyfriend and I got the asparagus and manchego ravioli for our main course. Unfortunately, their menu didn't offer too many vegetarian (and no vegan) options, so beware if you're a fellow herbivore. The ravioli was served with a tasty red pepper reduction and sliced avocados, which lent it a smooth, rich taste. Being that the sauce was red pepper based, it could have benefited from a little more spice and salt, as red pepper sauces can tend to be a bit bland.One major downside was that I felt somewhat rushed through my meal since there was a long line of people waiting to be seated (and my table was located next to the entrance). The environment is also a bit cramped for a more upscale restaurant in my opinion. Service was efficient, but a little cold, too. Overall, good food despite the anxious environment. Worth the experience, especially if you've got a Groupon!"
"5.0","Adding another 5 star visit, Saturday night was so good, we hit it Sunday night as well.  I think the second night was even better.  There is a ton of flavor creativity at this joint, very clearly a well trained/experienced executive chef.  I would chalk up the 3 star reviews as an off night or blame it on the person reviewing.  This place is stellar!"
"5.0","There's none better when it comes to home made taco and burritos! Fresh made right in front of you.  I'll walk past all the great restaurants in the strip just to have Edgar's! Wish they were still in the heart of the strip but I'll still make my way up to 27th St to get my fix..."
"5.0","I believe that the Summit is possibly the most underrated cocktail bar in Pittsburgh. Everything I've ever had there was top notch. Easily my favorite place to bring my out of town friends that want to have a drink and see some sights. And obviously only being a block from Grandview Ave, there are amazing sights to behold. Throw in a Duquesne incline ride, and it makes for an unforgettable night."
"5.0","I went to the Cranberry location and had the lemongrass soup and you get a nice portion for the price.  Everything is super fresh, hence the name, and I will def be back."
"5.0","This place is too cute! You order your food and then sit at your table, which is actually pretty efficient. I had the bacon egg and cheddar croissant, which was BOMB. Also everyone is really nice. Would recommend! And get the fresh orange juice, it's really good too."
"5.0","This place is delicious! If you're a fan of non-greasy, quality pizza, this is your place to go! The prices are great, and a medium size pizza is about the size of a chain pizza places large. The dough always tastes fresh, and the ingredients are fairly high quality for a pizza joint. I live down the street so I can't say anything about delivery, but for pickup, the longest I've waited was 20 minutes."
"4.0","Good food, good customer service, open late, what more can you ask for. I had the chicken sharmola real good flavor. Worth stopping by."
"2.0","First of all, I am a Panera Bread LOVER!  However, this location was different.  Our breakfast sandwiches (egg / turkey sausage) were unedibile.  After the first bite there was a strong after taste. The only food up to par was the fresh fruit cup.  Ususally the staff are very nice and friendly at other locations, not the case here."
"3.0","Came here over the weekend with my wife to try some Nashville Hot Chicken. Opted for the chicken sandwich and was about to get 'Medium' when I was dissuaded by the Cashier who said the sandwiches run hot. Ordered a 'Mild' and was disappointed by the marked lack of heat... While the sandwich didn't quite have the Nashville flavor I hoped for, the sandwich was, however, plentiful, fresh, and the topped with tasty pickles and slaw. Only other complaint was just that every table was dirty and needed to be wiped down. Guess that's the sign of a popular place in a college town though. If I come back I'll up the ante and see if the flavors are more like Prince's or Hattie B's in Nashville."
"4.0","Was in Pittsburgh on a business trip, found this place unexpectedly and decided to try out its authenticity. Beef chow fun was actually pretty good, almost close to the ones I get in NYC. Portion was huge. Also got the small hot and sour soup, it was actually a lot smaller than expected. Use to a small being a pint container but this was smaller than that. Overall pretty good."
"5.0","What an experience! Best pastries in the entire city, hands down. Went to multiple locations and quality is extremely consistent. Getting a freshly brewed cup of coffee is mandatory(not really, but WOW it's good coffee). Highly recommended!"
"5.0","The food is amazing. A bit pricy but well worth it for the quality, freshness, etc. you get. I highly recommend this place. If you stop by ask for Kevin. He provided some of the best service I'be ever had."
"3.0","Really I'd give it a 3.5 -Came for brunch on a Sunday - wow was it packed - only had to wait 15 min to get seated but when you're hungry it seems like a lifetime.  Of course I had to get the Bloody Mary (it was Sunday after all) I just added the candied bacon - next time I'm going for it and adding the shrimp and soft shell crab!  I ordered the shrimp po boy - wasn't what I expected but it was pretty tasty - not knock my socks off good but tasty just the same and I don't know if I was just starving but the French fries were delicious. Hubby's blackened catfish Sammy, on the other hand, was awesome.  Super tasty and huge!  Probably would come here again but it is a little pricey."
"5.0","Great beer, food, service, and atmosphere! I stopped in for the first time while visiting from out of town - looking for exactly what this place delivered. Variety of awesome craft beer on tap. It's quality and variety over quantity here, with 6 beers on tap. Very happy they offer varied styles of brew; try the Gose and Saison for sure. Octopus entree was great and the Scotch Egg was killer! I will definitely visit again the next time I'm in town."
"3.0","Here is why Gennaro's gets three stars:1.) Delivery or pick-up is fast, even late night (under 20 minutes).2.) It's cheap.3.) You can order online.The pizza itself isn't anything to write home about.  It's better than Papa John's but not as good as Domino's.  (The only reason I'd go with Gennaro's over Domino's for cheap pizza is that Domino's is always at least twice as long to deliver as they say they will be.)  If you go in for service, you will be disappointed--definitely had staff finish taking selfies and sending off texts before acknowledging that we were at the counter at all.Overall, it's okay."
"1.0","The bartender wasn't very friendly. Actually, just asked for my check and threw it at me! Classy."
"5.0","I'll give 5 stars for  the tasty pizza. Me and my friends all think that this is the best pizza we ever had in Pittsburgh. I ordered Ranchoro ( not sure about the spelling) steak pizza. It's so delicious, pizza dough is so soft even after heating by microwave. I just feel it is a bit salty, but my friends say it's ok to them."
"1.0","Ordered takeout this morning : got my food and the chicken sandwich was raw . I tried to put it in the oven to cook it the rest of the way, but it was just such a turn off. I ordered food to not be hungry anymore and I get the food and it's not even edible . I called the restaurant and they offered me a gift card:said transaction Can not be reversed and refunded money. I know that is not true because I worked at eat n park before. Let me remind you I paid for something I didn't eat . Sad"
"4.0","This is a cute little taco stand next to Reyna's on 21st.  I ended up stopping by here with my fianc√© for a light afternoon snack after our lunch wasn't enough food for either of us.  The stand wasn't too much to look at as it was a couple of things cobbled together but there was a sign proclaiming their tacos to be the best in the city.  As such I decided to go with a chorizo taco while my fianc√© went with the shrimp at $3 each.  The man behind the grill cooked both of them up fresh while also warming the soft tortilla shells.  He asked us if we wanted everything on them and we both said yes not knowing what everything was. It ended up being some lettuce, tomato, cheese, sour cream, cilantro, salt and freshly squeezed lime juice.  I ate my taco right after receiving it and it certainly hit the spot.  The temperature of it was perfect while the chorizo had a nice kick and my favorite part was the lime juice which gave a nice little sourness to combat the heat.  My fianc√© also really enjoyed her taco and the shrimp that I tried was good.The bottom line for me is that I would stop by here again in the future.  They had a number of interesting tacos, burritos and empanadas that I noticed on the menu that I am sure I would love."
"5.0","Mezzo is my favorite floor of the 3 floors of this Sienna restaurant.  It's nice that they take reservations, as the first floor does not.  The food here is excellent, for example the flatbreads are some of the best in Pittsburgh.  We ordered the Chef's Bruschetta del Giorno, it's an item that changes daily, but were were absolutely enthralled by the creatively prepared bruschetta with pecorino cheese and Brussels sprouts.    I ordered the mushroom risotto which was deliciously prepared.The wine list is top notch, with lots of unusual options by the glass.  We arrived before the rest of our party, so we sat at the bar, and the bartender was extremely knowledgeable and let us sample a wine before we ordered.  He made us feel welcome and his recommendations were right on the mark.Our waiter was excellent, too.  He overheard we were headed to the Benedum so he had the kitchen hurry our entrees, he was extremely attentive, helpful and on the ball.  Overall, this is one of your best options to eat in the Cultural District.  Reliably great food, wonderful service, and reasonable prices!"
"5.0","Wonderful tea shop with a great calming atmosphere. It is a small, independently owned business, started by a woman after she retired. I love when someone makes their dream a reality! The menu is pretty large with lots of sandwiches and baked goods. I had an iced caramel tea latte, which was delicious. My husband had a chocolate chai with almond milk and a PB&C sandwich, which he loved. And my sister had an Arnold on the Green that she said was very good.It is worth the trip to support a small business, but also because the tea is just lovely! It also worth the (short) wait for the tea to steep, because it gives you a few minutes to enjoy the relaxing setting. :)"
"2.0","Way too overpriced and nothing special with the atomosphire. Foods are Okey and presentation is good but nothing authentic by any means."
"5.0","First of all, the staff at Caffe Mona are so lovely and personable!  They are so accommodating and friendly!The food was absolutely fantastic - there is a great variety to order from! I decided on the Elvis, a sweet crepe with my favorite food groups: peanut butter and bacon!!!   Most importantly, the coffee is so flavorful, I didn't even need cream or sugar! Coffee is a necessity in my life, and it definitely complimented my sweet meal.The outside deck pays a sweet homage to the 'umbrellas' of the three rivers arts festival by their own exhibit of multi-colored hanging umbrellas. It was perfect for the sunny day- just enough colorful coverage!Caffe Mona does not disappoint- I can't wait to return soon!  Next time I hope to try a savory crepe - the buffalo chicken crepe looked delicious."
"4.0","So far I've been to the Shadyside and Oakland locations and this one is by far my favorite. There is usually a shorter wait, but the food has always been better in my opinion too. I usually feel satisfied and happy after eating here, while the other location usually leaves me feeling pretty bloated. Today I got brunch with a few friends and we ordered the strawberry crepes, chocolate chip banana crepes, lyonnaise potatoes, and Tex-mex omelette. The omelette was absolutely amazing!! I love potatoes too so I would highly suggest that dish. The crepes are a bit too egg-y for me, but they are also a staple dish to order here.Overall, Pamela's isn't somewhere I'd usually lean towards going to and there are many brunch spots in the area that I prefer, but.....It is definitely a must-visit stop in the city and never a disappointment!"
"3.0","I have not written a review for Pamela's in the past mostly because it feels wrong saying anything negative, due to the fact that it's almost a Pittsburgh institution- It's like dissing the Steelers; You don't do it, even if they lose!- And I would really have never given it more than a couple stars. That being said, I realized something recently when the BF and I went for breakfast...I'm not such a fan of the lunch nosh, but I love it for breakfast. For me, breakfast should be a greasy spoon-ish type experience. I want eggs and sausage and potatoes, all cooked to greasy perfection on a griddle type apparatus, and Pamela's does it very well. I don't really like pancakes, but even I have to admit the chocolate chip crepes are pretty good. And don't get me started on their famous Lyonnaise potatoes... I had the sausage and cheese omelet and the BF had the chorizo hash and eggs. His was good with the slightly spicy chorizo and hash, topped with a dollop of sour cream, and my was great; oozing with cheese and stuffed with sausage. Add the toast and yummy potatoes and you get enough food for at least two for like $8 or $9 bucks! But I still scarfed my down all by myself. As far as the staff are concerned, I'm a bit biased (I have many friends who work there), so I will only say I have never heard of anyone having a problem there. And if you have, it was probably your fault. Overall, I would probably give it 3.5 stars if I could, but as Yelp has yet to let us designate half stars, I am going with 3 stars, giving 4 for breakfast and 2 for lunch."
"5.0","I've had many things here that I'd love to have over and over again.Like many others I love Indian food and I love coming here.The fresh baked naan is to me probably the best I've had in the city. The chicken tandoori is so full of flavor and the chicken always juicy.The portions are enough to feed a small family, I swear. Literally I've gotten meals here that I can stretch out for days as leftovers.The market is so much fun too because they carry all kinds of neat foods and other things you wouldn't find anywhere else.You can smell the goodness while walking up to the building from at least a block away.If you've never been, remedy that. Stat."
"3.0","Ok, let me start by saying that I'm giving 3 stars instead of 5 for a few reasons unrelated to the food itself. 1. The counter staff and their lack of communication with the guests. This restaurant is unique because you order at the counter and then everything else is self serve. This concept is not new to me, but it was my first time at this establishment, and it would have been nice for the girl taking our order to simply say 'Have you eaten here before?', and if we said 'No', she could have simply taken a moment to explain how everything works. 2. The place was clean overall but there were quite a few gnats flying around the day I went. 3. This place is a BYOB and they charge you a $5 corking fee (which is fine), but they don't actually uncork your bottle for you. If you are going to charge me $5, at least uncork my Prosecco and offer wine glasses (which are available behind the counter), without me having to ask. That being said, the food at Cafe Raymond was delicious. We ordered a few separate dishes and everyone was more than satisfied with their meal. We had the Two Eggs Breakfast, BLT Croissant, Corn Beef Hash with Two Eggs and the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. Our meal was served quickly and it was delicious. As a person who was raised in the serving industry, I know that the staff can make or break a restaurant. And although I would consider going back to Cafe Raymond if I were specifically in the The Strip area, I would definitely rather spend my money somewhere like Square Cafe (Regent District), where both the food AND the service were outstanding."
"4.0","I actually thought Cafe Phipps was pretty good and would eat here again when visiting Phipps. Reminds me of a smaller version of Panera Bread with salad, soup and sandwich options. Order places at the counter and brought to the table. We were served quickly even though they were busy. Prices approximately $7-$10 a person with water to drink. Environmentally friendly. Would eat here again."
"4.0","Decent pizza at a decent price. I picked up so I cannot comment on their delivery. Check out their specials to save a few bucks. Grab a pizza and eat at the outdoor picnic table at the library next to it."
"4.0","Although a little pricey, the food was delicious! The plates to be shared are very generous in size and we definitely over ordered. The Brussel sprouts (something I would normally stay far, far away from) were surprisingly good. The drinks were a little expensive, and a glass of wine was minuscule compared to a standard pour. The cider with pumpkin is definitely worth a try. Great atmosphere, although the music was very loud (and that's coming from someone in their early twenties!!)"
"3.0","Small restaurant with very limited seating but fast service so a great place if you need a quick bite to eat! Tacos are very good; however, hit or miss sometimes the chicken tacos are very dry with minimal flavor. I do love the queso and they give you plenty of chips to go with it! All around a good place for tacos if you don't have the time for a sit down restaurant!"
"5.0","This little store, which sells Italian (Irish, and some other) decor and home-y things, ROCKS. Maria, the owner, also does cooking classes in the apartment upstairs. If I still lived in Pittsburgh, I'd LIVE there."
"5.0","Just had my last bbq chicken tacos of the season and I'm really going to miss these guys.  Craftwork catering set up shop in a stand in the US Steel Plaza on Grant Street at the beginning of the summer and I quickly became addicted to the 2 for $5 taco lunch.  They grill 'em in their bbq sauce right in front of you, put them in a little flour tortilla of perfect thickness and top off with some fresh cilantro, tomatoes,  queso fresco, and either stop there or you can add some of their mouthwatering Pineapple salsa yourself. They  have a ton of other options like quesadillas, bahn mi and sandwich style, and all for a great price.  They also had portobella, mahi-mahi, shrimp, carnitas and brisket as options for your meat, but I got hooked on the bbq chicken.  So so good.  Will be craving them til next summer. I definitely would use them for an event if I had one, I also think they would be a great treat for an office party.  I hope they open up a Taqueria soon!  A little birdy told me they might..."
"2.0","You close at 9!!!  My Grandmother stayed awake longer than that, God rest her soul!!!"
"5.0","Still loving Caffe Mona after over 2 years of going! I haven't found another brunch place in Pittsburgh that I like more. If you live in Pittsburgh and haven't been yet, I encourage you to check it out! They have delicious food, great coffee, and a lovely atmosphere. The inside is decorated very nicely and the outside patio is so fun with the umbrellas. I've never had to wait longer than 5 minutes for a table either, which is great for me as I usually decide that morning if I'm going out for breakfast or not. The staff is also very kind! They recently updated their menu, too. Ordering tip: go with a friend and split a sweet and savory crepe!"
"5.0","This is best place for Indian food, if anyone is craving for Indian cuisine this is a go to place. We ordered for dosa, chicken gravy and chicken Biryani which is their speciality and best among the menu.Will surely visit soon again !"
"3.0","Once again, I trusted some friends who said I NEED to go to Pamela's. I was very excited since breakfast food is my favorite (so are burgers and those can be eaten as breakfast if you love yourself enough!) I was pretty disappointed tbh. There was nothing bad about the food, but definitely nothing special about it. 'What about the hotcakes though?!' people have asked. Same thing I told ya before - nothing special. They were tasty, but it still wasn't enough to make me want to go back. I probably won't go back unless friends want to meet up there. Again, nothing bad about the place, but if I wanted some tasty trustworthy pancakes, I'd go to McDonald's (this is not a bad comment, I really do enjoy McD's hotcakes!)"
"4.0","Had breakfast and dinner there a couple of times. Its your traditional Eatn Park and the food is good especial the Superburgers. Breakfast has a wide variety of choices including breakfast bar. Good food and quick service. Friendly and helpful waitresses. Everyone smiles.... an oldie but still a goodie... :-)"
"5.0","It's not easy to give any place 5 stars  but this was easy. Great food, great service and a real feel of community. If you don't know what to order just ask. The portions are very generous with meats not just rice. One meal can feed 2 people but you won't want to share. A couple of must trys the Lamb Chops make sure you order at least three and the ground chicken burger you will get a second order to go..."
"4.0","When I worked in Pittsburgh, I probably had lunch here once a week, so after being away for 9 years I was excited to try it again.   At about 6:00 on a weekday, we thought maybe they were closed because the outside was dark and unwelcoming.  Nothing had changed once we were inside, and I even recognized one of the servers.I started with the wonton soup, which is probably my favorite over any other.  I used to always get chicken chow mein, so opted for that again.   It wasn't as good as I remembered it.   Partly because it wasn't hot enough, and partly because it wasn't as flavorful.    Nevertheless, I ate about half and took some home.   I also got the upgraded fried rice, and truly was disappointed with it as the rice wasn't cooked enough and was kind of crunchy.The menu is extensive and my husband was thrilled with his chicken dish, so I would probably order something different if I were to return."
"3.0","MR Bulgogi food truck and Couch Brewery have this awesome set up: Bingo, Brews and Bulgogi on Wednesday nights! And to be honest, I agreed to these plans with my friends just to try MR Bulgogi! The food was verrrrry good, I got the Korean BBQ tacos and then the nachos (Korean style). The food had so much flavor and just the right spicy with the kimchi. However the portions are so small; that's why I needed the nachos as well. They were also very pricey for the size (9$ for 3 4inch tacos). My friends said they didn't think the food-to-price was worth it since they were all left hungry. I'd have to agree. I have a goal to try all Pittsburgh food trucks because I believe them to be the more authentic food at a (usually) reasonable price. So I am glad I tried MR Bulgogi, but next time it'll probably a drinking munchie snack and not dinner."
"1.0","Il Tetto is a great spot for drinks with a beautiful view of the city, however the logistics and drink service leave much to be desired. Getting up to Il Tetto is an awkward elevator ride up (after waiting in the queue downstairs depending on how crowded it is) ... and the same awkward elevator ride to get back down. The service has never been great, but my most recent visit was by far the worst experience. The bartenders were flat out rude and seemed inconvenienced to even take notice of us as we sat at the bar. One of the bartenders aggressively grabbed the (filthy) menu from under my friend's arm as soon as we gave our order.  The entire staff was so wrapped up in themselves and their own conversations that they barely took notice of the customers. Safe to say I will not be returning to this establishment anytime soon."
"4.0","This place has very good food.  The waiter Matthew was very attentive. The Lobster Roll was good, the tenderloin sliders very tender, great soup, yummy housemade great fruit soda.  20 bucks is the minimum.  I forgot to take pictures of the food.  My bad."
"4.0","We stopped here a few weeks after they opened and came back on a return visit a few weeks later because we liked it so much.  We really like Cinderlands beer.  When we first came here the bartender gave us some samples to introduce us to their type of beer.  I'm not a big Ipa fan but I love their Ipas here and my wife does too.  When I taste their beer it's very good and refreshing.  Beer doesn't always make you feel that way but their beer does.  We tasted a lot of their different beers and we liked most of them.  My wife loves their Ipa called Stack and they just came out with their Littlefoot which I enjoyed on our last visit.  I probably liked the other beers they had on our previous visit but this was still a very good Ipa.       On our first visit it wasn't too busy at first but it started to get busy later in the day.  It was the day after Christmas.  On our second visit it was busy because it was a Saturday evening and playoff football was on.  They have a lot of seating in the back but in the very front is the bar.  They have seats along the wall, about a 13 seat bar, and a bar right in front of their open kitchen which is neat. The heat from the kitchen kept us warm on a bitterly cold Pittsburgh Saturday night!     The workers that we have encountered here all seem pretty nice.  They work good together and it is a good environment.  It has to be because if you sit at the bar there is a lot going on in front of you.  That is probably the only thing that I don't like about Cinderlands if you sit at the bar.  Since the kitchen is open and right next to you there is a lot of movement but it still doesn't take away from their beer and it's still a really good atmosphere.  We watched football on the second night and had a great time.  They have a food menu that I think is a little expensive but it is different.  There are a lot of interesting items on their food menu.   I don't know if we will ever eat here but we will be back for their great beer."
"4.0","Good breakfast Big portionsFriendly serviceHad the omelet with fetaWife had chocolate chip banana pancake Both were very good"
"3.0","We stopped by after we couldn't find any parking in nearby Lawrenceville. They sat us by the giant garage door that they open in the summer, and so we were really cold the entire time. The restaurant was about 75% full. We ordered sushi appetizers which were very good, but not the best we've had. The seafood was fresh, and the scallops I had were very sweet and perfectly cooked. Unfortunately, the shrimp were way over done. The worst part was the service. Our waiter was pleasant, but I waited about 20 minutes for a Pepsi, and we waited nearly 45 minutes for the sushi. We waited another 20-30 min for our dinner. He never apologized once. Even though the food is decent, it's not worth the terrible service."
"4.0","Sausalido is a nice upscale Italian restaurant in the heart of Bloomfield.  The first thing you'll notice about this place is the relatively small space.  The layout is somewhat intimate; however, I couldn't help but be mildly turned off by the weird curtain partitioning the entrance from the remainder of the restaurant.  Despite what seemed to me as an eyesore, our experience was solid.  The menu is single paged, with limited appetizers, entrees and deserts.  Not a critique, but mostly in-line with menus of other upscale establishments.  Course by course:The smoked gouda is an absolute must-order item.  Gently fried on the outside, nice and creamy on the inside-this item was cooked perfectly and was a great way to start out our meal.  Our entrees came with salads.  Nothing too special here: just a nice blend of greens with a the unique addition of beets.  My main meal consisted of a vegetarian ravioli dish, which was savory and well-executed.  My main critique however would be the sauce the ravioli was placed in was somewhat too watery for my tastes.  A creamier sauce would have been preferable.  My date enjoyed her risotto dish, which appeared to be a great value both in terms of portion size (freaking huge), and taste-very rich, very tasty.  Desert was a fantastic peanut butter creme brulee.  Highly recommended.  Overally, this restaurant is solid.  It wasn't the most memorable dining experience, but still solid and recommended.  Service was friendly, just a bit slow and inconsistent at times.  Online reservations via Yelp are a very nice touch.  This seems like a great place to check out if you you're looking to book an upscale restaurant in a pinch.  The BYOB is tremendous with $2 corkage fee.  Perhaps one of the best BYOB values in the city."
"4.0","For either Delivery of Take-Out this establishment never disappoints!  The quality of the food is always superb and the staff has been extremely friendly both in person or over the phone.When ordering for lunch, order nice and early, while delivery itself is fast you could be in line with the lunch rush.  The food is too good to have to wait!!In person, the restaurant fills up fast.  They're good about accommodating small and medium parties.  The only bad thing is that it can feel crowded."
"4.0","Visited on a weeknight. There was one other couple dining so it was quiet and we sat right away. The waitress was friendly. The bean dip and bread they give you to start is super tasty. I ordered the salmon with coconut curry and greens, husband ordered the crab cakes with risotto. Our starter salads, with a helping of beets, were very good. The small aluminum bowl they serve it in is very awkward to eat out of, however. My salmon was quite good and cooked perfectly; the sauce tasted great but was a tad thin (making it drippy to eat). The greens were underdone, and served in large leaves that had to be cut to actually eat, which was difficult because of the underdone-ness. The well-done pieces were a good complement to the dish, though I would have preferred a starch with the salmon. My husband's crab cakes were very good, great crab-to-filling ratio, but he said he found several shell pieces. The risotto was the perfect texture but a hint too much salt for me.Now the ambiance, sadly, leaves much to be desired. There was no music playing in the front of the house, so we were serenaded by KISS FM being blared in the kitchen. The chef alternated between singing along with the music and sitting outside at their outdoor seating drinking a beer and chatting with buddies. He and our server often had personal conversation, which I don't mind if done out of earshot, but they made little effort to avoid airing their personal business for everyone inside. When you're paying $25 for an entree, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect some quiet mood music and atmosphere during your meal. This might be due to it being a slow weeknight, but still.We'll probably go back on weekends when it's busier and the staff are not so much in 'laid back' mode. All in all it's great, fresh food so I still recommend it."
"1.0","Went there on a Wednesday afternoon with 10 people. There was no one on the restaurant or bar area at all. We asked to sit outside and they didn't even come to take our drink order after 20 minutes. Finally after 25 minutes we all stood up and left. Then the waitress came out and said sorry as we were exiting. This isn't the first time we have had slow service there. They acted like they don't want anything to do with a party over 4. They easily could have made 300+ on our group because we were drinking + eating and it was for a friends birthday, yet they just didn't care. Will never go back again."
"5.0","The Summit is by far the best bar in Pittsburgh. The atmosphere is low-key and relaxed, but the drinks are top-notch and of extremely high quality. I have sampled nearly all their drinks from the summer and fall menus at this point and each one has been special. The cocktails have interesting stories to tell and I recommend trying several of them. I have also never met a barstaff that was so dedicated and skilled at their jobs. One waitress whizzes around during happy hour, single-handedly waiting on dozens of customers. I am super impressed by The Summit and wish it were closer to downtown so I could visit more often."
"5.0","I love, love, love it here! Came in one weekend in October for one of my girlfriends birthdays. We had a party of 8 for a 9pm reservation.  Kind of late for dinner, but I think that was the only one available for a group as large as ours. Sausalido is BYOB and my group certainly brought our own booze.Our waitress was patient and attentive and seemed to be having fun with the group of us.  Not many other parties were in the restaurant at the time we were, which was probably for the best.  We started with the smoked gouda, brussels, and candied apples and pears.  All were 5 stars.  I got their soup of the day which was a mushroom soup - kind of watery, but still good flavor after adding a bit of salt and pepper.  I then asked for them to make me a salmon caesar for my main course and the staff had no problem accommodating my request.  My salad was very good...and enormous.  Others got the butternut squash rav, wild mushroom risotto, crab cakes, and chicken.  Everything was amazing.We ended the meal with a slice of chocolate fudge cake. Very rich and dense, but moist.  Definitely something to share.Overall a wonderful experience with excellent food and the vino flowing.  I can't wait to come back!"
"3.0","Meh, it was alright. The service was great but the ambiance was just okay. The food I tried tasted like it came directly from a can with some spices added. I was underwhelmed by the whole experience. We had dinner plates for brunch and serving sizes were appetizer-sized. I think this might work as tapas, but for me it wasn't good enough to recommend or go back."
"5.0","I think these are my new favorite macarons!I work next door and have been low key avoiding this place because I've heard how wonderful the place is and I'm always trying (failing) to avoid bread. Anyway, a friend and I were having a rough day at work and she suggested we stop in and grab something small so I obliged and I'm now addicted to their macarons. The quality is absolutely in the ingredients here folks."
"3.0","The tacos are good, but their meats can be dry. Hit or miss. They have smaller, conventional menu (chicken, steak, pork, veggie?) items for their tacos. While the service was fast and error-free, they are not the friendliest people."
"5.0","My husband and I had one of our first dates in Pittsburgh at Alexander's, so it has a special place in my heart.  I knew he was a keeper when we ordered the asparagus/goat cheese appetizer and I loved it so much that he let me eat all but one piece on my own.  There is a bar areas out front that has a more casual feel and dining room in the back.  The dining room is small and intimate offering several booths along the sides of the restaurant and several tables in the middle and towards the front of the dining room.  The decor has a homey feel with nice colors and a fun chandelier.The menu is much more extensive then a typical Italian restaurant.  There are several appetizer choices in addition to the previously mentioned grilled asparagus.  There are also several salads and two soup options, the soup of the day and wedding soup.  The first time I was there I tried the veal diablo which was veal with hot peppers and mushrooms and a Marsala sauce.  It was delicious.  It had a nice kick but wasn't too hot that you didn't enjoy it.  On my second visit I enjoyed the 'pastabilities' create your own pasta.  With 10+ sauce choices plus 10+ pasta the combinations seem endless!  I enjoyed the angel hair with the Marsala wine and red pepper sauce.  My husband had the Bolognese and was equally happy.  The pasta seemed to be in an endless bowl.  I felt like I was eating forever and there was still two meals worth of pasta left in my take out container.  The build your own pasta is quite a value for the price (although it does not come with a soup or salad like the other entrees do).  We were stuffed, but after seeing several desserts go by, I decided I wanted to order the Napoleon.  It was stuffed with strawberries and blueberries and the cream was delectable.  Overall a great dining experience.  We will be back."
"1.0","Ordered dal fry and gajar halwa. Dal fry was a joke, half boiled dal floating in water. Gajar halwa was the same with oil and half crushed carrots. This is place is waste of space which can't even make a decent lentil soup! Only reason it is functional is because it's is Pittsburgh where there are not many other options."
"4.0","Excellent experience. Food and service was great...highly reommend!!"
"5.0","Best tacos in Pittsburgh! The flavors are perfect. I wish they had a liquor license and a bigger spot."
"5.0","First time stopping in and was greatly pleased by the sandwich choices as well as the prices. I had the North Shore sandwich and really enjoyed the combination of flavors and left satisfied with my choice."
"1.0","I've eaten at Alexander's for a decade, but, like Del's, it's becoming one of those places where the food gets worse every time you go there.  Today, half the lettuce I had on my Caesar salad was rotten.  I have no idea why it ever left the kitchen.  And it was take-out, too, so there wasn't much I could do about it after driving all the way home.  (They gave me the wrong entr√©e too, but at least it was edible.)I finally think I'm done with this place."
"4.0","My parents never been to the strip and decided to take them and do some lunch here. The service was really good. My parents really enjoyed how nice our waiter kevin was. The food was incredible. I will have to say the sushi was not that good. The Philadelphia roll, the salmon was dry. The spider roll the meat in the roll was dry too. However, my parents had the crab cake sandwhich and sockeye salmon and those made up for my sushi. Also the lobster bisque is some of the best i ever had."
"5.0","One sentence description of my experience just in case you don't read the full review: this place serves amazing food with delicious flavors and one of my favorite Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh. We were here for Friday dinner after an exhausting week. The place seemed to be busy but fortunately, we were able to find a table for 2 people immediately. The wait staff is very friendly and nice. They gave us ample time to look at the menu and place our order. One thing to remember when you visit this place is, they follow the spice levels sincerely. So, please know your spice level before you place order here. We ordered chicken satay, Pad thai, and pineapple curry. The portion sizes are generous, and the plate is well made and organized. I will start with the chicken satay. They are generous portions of 6 chicken served over 6 sticks with peanut chutney and other veggies on the side. The chicken is well marinated and packed with subtle flavors. It is so juicy that I liked it just by itself with any peanut chutney. However, adding the peanut chutney just added another layer of flavor which made it even better. I highly recommend this dish. We ordered Pad thai with breaded tilapia and spice level of 6. Usually, the add-ons at many other places are less in quantity. However, they added generous amount of tilapia to the Pad thai. Just the noodles with fried egg and tamarind sauce flavor is delicious and adding tilapia to it just elevated the dish to another level. We had enough to bring it back home for a late dinner! Last, but not the least, pineapple curry which is served with a good bowl of rice and a spice level of 5. The dish looked so colorful and again generous quantity with a good number of pineapple chunks. I loved the soupy part of the dish which consisted of coconut flavor mixed with a bunch of other spices. Good quantity for one person if they are extremely hungry, but there will enough for a left over if you are someone with a small appetite. Overall, great experience and great food with flavors that are on-spot. I highly recommend this place and it is good to dine alone, to go on a date, or to hang out with a bunch of friends. Also, they have take out which is also very popular."
"5.0","The greatest taco store on earth: Super quick and totally fresh. This place is absolutely awesome whether it's dinner at the bar, take out or late night food (they're open after the bars close on the weekend). Don't let lines deter you- if it's crowded the extremely friendly staff works super hard to get everything out quickly and accurately! As a vegetarian, I personally love getting the vegan tacos and adding queso fresco on top. Two is the perfect amount for a meal and one is a great snack. And they come out looking totally instagrammable ;) The only things this place needs to add are margs and cerveza!"
"5.0","Delicious burgers and great beer!My boyfriend and I decided we were looking for a laid back beer and burger day and to catch a movie after. I looked up impossible burgers in Pittsburgh to see where it was offered. I ordered the Strawberry Way beer which was a light and slightly sweet beer. I loved it! For my meal I ordered an impossible burger on vegan bread with caramelized onions and mustard. I opted for herb fries for an upcharge. My boyfriend ordered an impossible burger with blue cheese, greens, mushrooms, and honey (Forest Hills burger). He also opted for the herb fries. We both loved our meal! This was my boyfriend's first time trying the impossible burger and he said it was better than real meat. The herb fries were also a huge hit. Highly recommend if you're looking for great burgers and beer in a clean restaurant with friendly service."
"5.0","Mmmm. This place is a must visit breakfast spot. I could go on about the chorizo hash with two eggs over easy, or the croissant French toast with nuts, and the morning after always hits the spot too! But I won't go into detail. The staff is friendly, the service quick and efficient, and the food is always delicious."
"4.0","The place was dead when we got here and remained so throughout our dinner.  Only one other patron.  It appeared that they were doing some takeout.  Also I think they do a busy lunch.  Service was good and food was really good.  Would come back again.  Really enjoyed the chicken curry with mango."
"4.0","Myself and some work friends have been wanting to check out Freshii for the past few weeks and today we finally made it happen. First of all, the atmosphere of this place is very cool and chill. From the grass wall to the open seating to the personable workers who actually use you name, I really dig this place.  Lots of great options from salads and wraps to burritos, salads and bowls. All come vegetarian with an option to add protein at an up charge.  They also do a range of smoothies and juices.  You can customize anything with a card and they get points for having Sriracha available.  I stuck with the Khao San Burrito which had brown rice, spinach, almonds, edamame, mushrooms, carrots, cabbage, spicy peanut & lemongrass sauce clocking in at 650 cals.  And let me just say, nutrition fills you up. Between this and a bag of crisps, I was feeling very satisfied. All that and a bottled drink ran me just under $12 for lunch. Not bad but it is on the pricey side in my opinion. Adding a protein or a smoothie would easily bump this to $16.  Honestly, the Burrito was fantastic. Tons of flavor and true to the name, fresh(ii)!We went between 11a and Noon with minimal wait time but on the way out there was a good crowd so expect a bit of a wait at lunch. One thing we noted was for being what appears to be a very green organization, there isn't any recycling.   It's not a deal breaker by any means and maybe logistically it wouldn't work but I feel like it is a missed opportunity.Overall, I'm really impressed and this is now a solid option in my book. Check them out for sure!"
"1.0","Three waitresses last Tuesday morning were so busy talking that I had to go up to them three times and interrupt ( after politely standing there and waiting for one of them to ask 'May I help you?' And giving up before interrupting each time)....once to ask if we could order (they then accidentally gave one of our plates to someone else who came in later but ordered the same pancakes), once to ask for more coffee and once to pay....I thought we had to be on Candid Camera it was so ridiculous!  I give them one star because the food was so delicious...  We tried the location on Murray Avenue and the food there was just as perfect along with really efficient and kind service....go to the Murray Avenue location ....line is long for a reason but it moves fast...  The corned beef hash and pancakes are the best anywhere."
"5.0","I walked up to the food truck and it was playing 'Gangam Style', so I knew this would be something to remember.  I got the Bulgogi combo with meat and dumplings over rice.  It had just enough spice, not too much. but perfect.  The combo of the cilantro (if you are not a cilantro person, just get it on the side)  and the kimchi with the sauces makes me want to dance.  You can mix and match items and get additional sauces if preferred.   The owner and his crew are fast, efficient and super friendly.  Look for this one."
"4.0","I've eaten here 3 times, and every time was great. I heart BYO's! Most recently I had the pork chop, and it was delicious. My friend had the pasta bolognaise (sp) which was also really great- hearty and filling. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting... the owner and staff are all really nice. They ran out of a couple things we wanted to try, but I'll be back to rectify that."
"4.0","I love this place! Great value. Closed 2:30-4pm though,  at present this isn't reflected in their hours on yelp. I eat curries, fried rice, drunken noodles, love it all... I've never really had a bad dish here."
"4.0","Yes! Just go and check it out. My favorite foods are simple, yet expertly prepared. These folks know how to make authentic tacos and they are delicious. we had the chicken and pork and both were fantastic. I would give them 5 stars if they started making their own tortillas or at least bought from a small place versus the bagged Mission brand... in any event, we'll be back!"
"3.0","If it were not for this being a rooftop bar and good for a bigger group of people I am not sure I would go very often. The space is great and I love being on the rooftop for the warmer months. But I am not overly impressed by their drinks. This is a happy hour spot, the space calls for it, because of that you would think that there would be more specials, or more signature drinks but that really is not the case. If you want a beer they have it, or a gin and tonic . . . it is not a problem. However, it does run on the pricey side and I always feel like the bar is a bit understaffed.  That being said, I will always be back on those warmer nights because of the rooftop. . . so that is a good call and compensates for the overall average bar experience that it would be without the space."
"5.0","My husband and I drove up from Va to Pa with friends for the Pittsburgh vs Browns game 12/1/2019. My husband is 62, been a fan all his life and never been to a home game. His friend the same. He and his wife were celebrating their 40th wedding anniversary.  We went downtown to find the stadium. We also stumbled on this restaurant. We figured that a resturant with Jerome Betis name has to be good. We were not disappointed. The food and service were great! George was our server and he treated us like royalty. We heard that the carrot cake was Jerome's mother's recipe. She must be an awesome cook. That slice of cake was enough to feed several people and the best carrot cake we have ever tasted.......and I'm a southern cook. Wish I could meet Mother Betis and watch her make her world class carrot cake. Anyway, this was a weekend we will always remember...close friends, good food, and the Steelers won! This was the best road trip ever!"
"5.0","Hands-down best bar in Pittsburgh. Well-balanced cocktails with relaxed ambience. Excellent service, no BS. Roll up the incline with a stern gaze and stumble back with a goofy smile. Their Cucumber Press is dangerously crushable. Outrageous Orange is my life. Avocado deviled eggs with chorizo pepperoni? Ridiculously good! Green Tea Fizz is better than dessert. Jay is the man!"
"5.0","Hands-down best brunch ever and Rod Grandma Square is amazing food was amazing and Grace really enjoyed my homework and I drink your tea's and the outside is amazing and the food is very unique and they gave us free food afterwords and there's free bottle water from Cosco and chocolates are free with the coffee"
"4.0","We originally decided to go to Alexander's for an official dinner for a seminar speaker, expecting 15-20 people to come.  So I talked to the manager and he set me all up, despite the fact that I was calling only 3 days before the dinner.  He was so super nice and wonderful.  We wound up only having 5 (who passes up free food?) but it was still a lovely dinner.  The waitress was really helpful in suggesting the best things to get.  I agree about the bread...it was just 'meh'.  We didn't get an appetizer, but the homemade salad dressing (ranch) was very (very) good.  I got the special for that night - fresh veal, and it was so so so good.  The waitress said it would melt in your mouth, and it did.  I also got the marfredo sauce on malfada pasta as my pasta side, based on other Yelp reviews of this combination and it was also quite good.  Overall, great food.  I would definitely return."
"1.0","Got here about 3 hours before game time and were able to sit right now at the bar.   Ordered an appetizer with plans to order a main course later. After a long wait - they brought us the wrong appetizer.Had to wait a while for the right one and when it came finally got to order our main meal.  Got the signature 36 burger.Over 45 minutes later it arrived... Cold.  No one asked how it was or how we were doing.The burger and fries tasted like Applebee's quality but cold. Waste of time and money."
"4.0","This place was pretty good. I got the Szechuan chicken and it was really spicy, but I tasted a lot of hot sauce. The workers kept talking really loudly and there was no music playing, so it was really hard to hold a conversation with the person that I was with. This is a pretty good restaurant, but maybe there are others that are better."
"5.0","I've been to Sausalido a few times in the past and always thought it was good but I was never amazed by it.  Nonetheless while I was deciding what to order for my mother's birthday I decided to forgo the normal Mad Mex spread and give their drop-off catering a try.  IT WAS 100% AMAZING!  The food turned out delicious, everyone thought so and we have a lot of picky eaters in my family.  We even had someone with Celiac's and the owner of Sausalido, Nick, was very helpful in making sure that the majority of the food I ordered was gluten free.  This is my new go-to place!!!"
"5.0","My husband and I love it here. We used to frequent Tamari and were sad when it closed, but it was great to find out Roger Li had opened this place and it was somehow even better. It has always been an amazing experience. Just walking up to the place on the third floor is an experience--paper lanterns, large art coating the walls, the din of people enjoying themselves before you get to the top. It's a great atmosphere that feels exclusive. Dim, trendy, intimate. The kitchen is wide open and you can watch it all unfold from almost any seat except the bar and private room.The karaage is a necessity--Japanese fried chicken with an amazing rich gravy dipping sauce. It's generally on the happy hour menu as well. The handrolls are also very good and arrive with little pipettes of soy sauce. My favorite item from our last trip was the chirashi, a sashimi rice bowl. The robatayaki--a street food staple with skewered food grilled over hot coals--is also fantastic and something you won't see often anywhere else. Our favorites are the whole squid (grilled and cut into strips that end up being just like larger calamari rings, so don't be too scared to order it!), chicken skin, and the shishito peppers when they have them. Shishitos are generally not very spicy, but it's possible to get a really hot one every so often.It's easy to find yourself spending more than you were expecting to here, as the menu generally encourages you to order the items a la carte and it can be a bit pricey if you start to get excited by all the options. There are some dishes that can be ordered as a solo meal, such as a couple larger ramen bowls, but mainly you're ordering things piecemeal here. It's a great place to go once in awhile for a trendier happy hour or a fun night on the town. They also have one private room with two larger tables, which can be reserved for parties and is a nice experience. Keep in mind you'll want to check for reservations in general on the weekends--it is often packed!"
"2.0","The food here is not very interesting.  There's no way to keep out the cigarette smoke from the casino, so that's a distraction.  I don't think I will be going back."
"1.0","I order delivery from beta bites often. While delivery times usually always take an hour or longer (for fried food, it seems long) and I only live 1 mile away, the food is usually good. Today I discovered to my disappointment that the shrimp was completely undercooked, and there was no seasoning on anything. :("
"4.0","We ordered delivery dinner for four from Beta Bites. The order was placed online via the restaurant's website. I liked that one could select individual toppings for sandwiches, just as if one were there in person. The order arrived within an hour, the stated time, and all items were correct and hot.I ordered a Beta Kufta Sandwich. Kufta is a Moroccan take on the Mediterranean kofta. Mine was made with rolled ground beef, with toppings such as lettuce, tomato, and onions. The Moroccan spices were delicious! Extra sauce provided, too. The sandwich came with French fries, equally good. All of our party enjoyed their meal. Definitely a successful ordering in experience."
"3.0","I only came in to grab a breakfast sandwich to go but I thought the women running the shop were nice. I didn't have to wait long (~5 mins) for the sandwich, but it turned to be just okay. There are definitely tastier croissants to be found elsewhere in the city and the cheese looked like your average slice of Kraft singles, but the price was  reasonable and I'm all for supporting local businesses. They also have a bunch of pastries so I might try on my next trip there. But for now giving the place 3*, but will update it when I try some of their other stuff"
"5.0","I was visiting Pittsburgh for two weeks, ate at almost 10 restaurants and this was my absolute favorite! The place gets really busy, so definitely call ahead of time and make a reservation. The restaurant is tucked away upstairs in a quiet building - climb those stairs, it's worth it! Although the menu isn't too lengthy, I was very overwhelmed because I wanted to order everything! We started with the robatayaki - pork belly and chicken skin. It was seasoned and cooked perfectly! The pork belly was my favorite since the little bit of fat just made it more flavorful. Moving on, we had an appetizer, the server recommended his favorite - zucchini dengaku. It was pan fried zucchini, ground chicken, togarashi, beets, saikyo miso sauce. I'm not even a big fan of zucchini but I can eat this every day! The flavors from the chicken and the miso sauce made the zucchini heavenly.After that, we tried the sashimi plate, which included salmon, tuna, yellowtail, fluke, octopus, striped bass. It was extremely fresh, definitely one of the most fresh fish I've had. We also ordered the eel and spicy tuna hand roll. We also ordered the ramen, which I do not recommend, mushy and plain. Let's stick with the fresh fish and flavorful robatakayi. They also offer a wide variety of alcohol, which is always appreciated after a long day of work."
"1.0","They say the closing time is 9 pm and the door is locked at 8:45. I even tried knocking and the lady inside didn't pay any attention and was busy cleaning. Not the type of service you expect for a good quality pizza chain"
"5.0","I recently dined with friends at Il Tetto and had a really nice time.  My friends can be beer snobs but they had something for everyone.  The food was really good too.  Our server suggested some of her favorite items and they were on point."
"5.0","I LOVE THIS PLACE! While I was a Fellow at Carnegie Mellon, I was introduced to this place and fell in love. OBAMA came here too! Cash only, and nearly anything you order off the menu is pure GOLD!.. well.. not literally gold because that'd be weird to eat.. but its REALLY good food!Seriously. Don't even look. Just close your eyes, point at something, and order it. It's guaranteed to be de-lic-ious. I ordered almost everything off the menu during my summer here. I MISS IT! :'("
"5.0","I really appreciate this place. I like places that have different, unique things and this place has that. The chairs were cute, the decor was vintage and the place was industrial/rustic. The kitchen was open so you could see the cooks. There was the newly adopted, grouped seating but we had our own table. We were taken care of right away and our table was claimed, and we were to order at the front first. They have a lot of chalkboard signs which I'm a big fan of. The menu was pretty cool and they had just enough options. The best part is that they serve breakfast all day. I really liked that they had cream and sugar at a separate part so that you can add that to your tea or coffee. The waitress who was taken care of the tables was pretty nice and she started conversation. She made sure we wer taken care of. This place wasn't crowded and wasn't hard to be seated, especially on Saint Patrick's Day morning On the strip in which I had reservations that we wouldn't be sat. It was easy to do. What can I say..I like my tea like I like him; hot, blonde and sweet. :)"
"5.0","My go-to eat'n park! This is a newer location right on Banksville road. I've been to this location many times and I've never had a problem. The employees are great and the restaurant is super clean. Ask for Joan, she is THE BEST!  Always remembers our us and never forgets our usual order. The drive through is always a breeze as well. Call ahead to place your order & it will be ready within 20 minutes. They always give us a free cookie for to-go orders as well, which is nice. No complaints from me, I'd recommend."
"5.0","Great food! Their samosas are to die for and they always have a great selection of sauces and dips. Fun atmosphere and homey environment. Will definitely visit again!"
"1.0","This is the new Bar that's in the space Havana once stood. After a ten minute wait for a drink, I was ready to walk out, but to give an honest review I stayed and was finally waited on. I ordered a lemon martini, 8 bucks, the bsrtender didn't chill the martini glass properly so after shaking it warmed up rather quickly. It tasted sweeter than i liked but it wasn't bad. No kitchen, so no food. Let's see how long this place lasts. I was there a few days after opening night, it was very crowded and extremely loud. Not my type of bar."
"3.0","I come in constantly, kimmie is an amazing bartender and genoa is lucky to have her, shes the only bartender I will by a drink from because of poor service from the other two ladies I see there. My colleagues and I will not go to genoa any longer unless its kimmie serving us, we gave genoa many tries but bottom line, friendly and consistent service is what matters."
"1.0","Repeatedly advertises false information. No interest in making money. Far cry from professional. Makes you wonder why it's even in existence. Poorly run poorly managed mediocre product and abhorrent repugnant service. Folks there's too many other pizza joints out there that give a damn about their business. Patronize those places, not this dump."
"5.0","This was an amazing Gem right outside the Steelers Stadium. Incredible service by George. He recommended a lot of delicious items since it was our first time here. We will definitely be coming back every time we get the chance."
"5.0","Excellent‚Äã!!! fantastic food, everything was perfect from the temperature of my boyfriend's filet to my mother watering salmon to our awesome waiter!! presentation of everything was exquisite. MUST order the brussel sprouts and lobster Mac and cheese !!! a bit pricey but definitely worth it!!! find a cheap bottle of wine on the menu and you have a perfect dinner."
"5.0","We have been here two times, each dish has been very satisfying. Our last dish, the Mushroom Puff was light and flakey with outstamdimg flavors, the mushrooms truly shined.One note here, leave room for desert, these are some of the best in Pittsburgh. You will not be disappointed.A must visit. We will make our way through the menu."
"5.0","Robatayaki is on the money. Service is excellent. Definitely one of Pittsburgh's best Japanese joints."
"5.0","We have been there several times with my friends,really nice place for breakfast,I love their nutellabananacrepe and french toast with berries and guys so friendly you should go and try mouthwatering crepes.... i just came back for delicious omlet today, and again and again never leaving this place unhappy .. thank you guys"
"4.0","OVERALL: fantastic ambience! Taste is above average and presentation is amazing (for sushi/sashimi). Wait is very long so don't come if you're in a rush. It's a little pricey for the portion size and taste. I want to start out by saying that I would definitely give Umami a 5 if it were slightly cheaper. The vibe of the place alone makes me want to go back multiple times. I may be biased since I love r&b, but the DJ was superb and the fact that they even have a live DJ is amazing. Kudos to that guy for making my experience a lot better. Anyway, about the food - the first thing I noticed was how great the presentation was. We sat right in front of the sushi chef, so that may have made a difference, but the way he plated and cut the sashimi right in front of us was beautiful. The taste of the ramen was good - not phenomenal or anything, but good. I would argue that it's pricey for the taste, though, but I did enjoy the meal. I would feel bad ordering this at another place with the price, but because Umami has a great atmosphere, it was ok. Would definitely recommend."
"5.0","Wonderful food and excellent service. Very pricey but worth every penny. We had the fried mozzarella paired with a Sauvignon Blanc. Wine was suggested by our server Shirley. She was spot on! We ordered Oscar Filet. I don't remember having a steak with so much flavor. 10 oz. of filet with back fin lump crabmeat and asparagus. Excellent!"
"1.0","First time going to sammys and their customers services is horrible. The ladies making my sandwich were impatient and moody. I felt bad that I will never get to try there so called famous roast beef sandwiches but I will not tolerate any type of rasicm. Yes I'm a African american man that lived in Pittsburgh my whole life and I expect great things from my people (all people) from Pittsburgh. Hopefully they can make some  changes in employment which I doubt. This is not a review on the food but how I was treated at this establishment."
"4.0","Employees are great. The food is ok. I usually go here to meet up with a friend. They need to lower the prices because it's not all that great."
"4.0","Salem's is a great place for lunch or dinner.  It is a cavernous space, easy to get to in the strip.  Small off-street parking lot for those who drive.  It's set up cafeteria style, with all of the selections on giant chalk boards hung from the ceiling.It can be a little overwhelming at first, but the guys behind the counter are super friendly and helpful if you need any assistance or have questions.I usually go with my friend Nutbar, who is a hard-core carnivore, and he always gets a lamb dish, usually a gyro or shish kabobs.  I get the falafel sandwich or the vegetarian curry.  The portions are huge, the ingredients are fresh, and everything is perfectly seasoned and cooked.  They always have a good selection of desserts, the baklava is good.  The hummus and naan is delicious.  The tabouleh is good, has a bit more parsley in it than I'm used to, but very fresh tasting.It can sometimes be a little chaotic at the cash register, where people pick up to-go orders as well as people like me who are eating on site.  But it's always a minor inconvenience.  Everything is served in styrofoam containers, helpful because often I can't eat everything.As other reviewers have mentioned, this is strictly a no-frills place in terms of decorating.  Dropped ceilings, rows of simple tables and padded restaurant chairs, and a few Steelers memorabilia on the walls.  But you don't come for the ambiance--you come for the food!This is the middle eastern counterpart of Spice Island, which also has great food in a kind of basic ambiance environment.  The prices, like Spice Island, are very reasonable.Be sure to stroll through the market after your meal--they have a great selection of middle eastern groceries and ready-to-eat food."
"5.0","Love this place!  Food and service were excellent!  We had the brunch special with the bacon/tomato/gruyere omelette, the lovely fruit plate, and banana Nutella crepe to finish. Definitely coming back and sending friends!"
"5.0","This is probably one my favorite brunch place in Pittsburgh lately.. I've been coming here since I moved this city for school, the place is pretty trending, decorated and smells like Europe.. today we came for Saturday brunch with group of 6, it was really busy, but we had seat right after we walked in.. servers and management is just working great here.. u can't complain, maybe because of thanksgiving weekend it was very busy. We ordered omlets, crepes, and some breakfast sandwiches. Ingredients are so fresh and tasty. I got apple bri crepe, melted bri cheese diced apple and walnuts with honey. It's definitely mouthwatering crepe u should give a try. Well before I go, I like to say best coffee ever u can ever taste here at Caffe Mona. You guys rocks !"
"5.0","Our family visited this restaurant for the first time on Father's Day and we will definitely be back. Our meal was delicious and we had a wonderful experience! We had a chance to talk to the owner of this family-owned business; he was very attentive to us and made us feel right at home. All of their ingredients come from local businesses, which is also very impressive! We had chicken parm, chicken marsala, Abby Alexandra's angel hair, and tiramisu. The portions were huge and we were very happy to take some leftovers home. Thank you for making our Father's Day so great!"
"3.0","It's a good place to come after work!! But it's very noisy it's hard to hear what people are saying when having a conversation. There really isn't much of a selection on the menu food wise. I was a little disappointed that boneless chicken wings were not on menu. Every bar has them????? The song trivia was really cool on Wednesday nights."
"5.0","I checked out this hidden gem I'm Lawrenceville for Sunday brunch and I was not disappointed! I was greeted by very friendly service that was consistent throughout the meal, and the atmosphere was top notch. Inside is very quaint, and there's also a cute porch out back. Our food was equally as wonderful, and we were treated by the hostess to a wonderful eclair dessert. I am looking forward to my next visit!"
"5.0","Very good pizza, excellent customer service, delivery is very fast. Will recommend this place for everyone!"
"5.0","Wow!! Super friendly staff, excellent food and great coffee.  I had a slice of French toast with fig compote, Brie and green apples!! Sooo good.  The owner, Eto, was warm and accommodating answering all of our tourist questions."
"5.0","I guess I'm well overdue to update my review for this place, especially based on how frequently I am checking in on Yelp.  This is, hands down, my favorite bar in the city of Pittsburgh.  Over time, it's become my 'Cheers,' where everybody knows my name... hopefully for nothing but good reasons.The bartenders here are quite possibly the most knowledgeable in the city, and their rotating cocktail menu is a testament to that.  Sure you can get a boring old Tito's and soda (guilty), but you can also have your tastebuds rocked off by a cocktail that you can't quite get anywhere else.  The food is still excellent and this menu also changes seasonally.  Most of the favorites I mentioned in my previous review are no longer on the menu, but they've been replaced by things that are even better.  The dishes they churn out are always consistent and I can't really think of a menu item that I haven't liked. The mac and cheese is always a solid selection, as are the deviled eggs carbonara.  Tacos, bone marrow, dumplings, the Cuban sandwich... there's really something for everyone in terms of food and libations.  Whether I'm in the mood for casual cocktails and conversation or the perfect place to start (or end) my evening, the Summit fits the bill time and time again, and I imagine I'll be back with another 5 star review in due time."
"1.0","Poor service!  I personally would recommend going anywhere but here. My group ended up leaving before we even ordered."
"5.0","not too sure how drunk works but i think my tastebuds work just the same no matter how drunk i am. with that said i wish there was hand sanitizer after the nights of debauchery followed by antoon's pizza. 5 bucks is great for a cheese pizza no matter what. The dough isnt super gluten-y, its got a good crunch to it but still soft and fluffy on the inside. random tip: powdered sugar on the pepperoni is so good- so what if the pizza is $6.50? you'll be smiling all night, its so good. btw twins work there! one is much cuter than the other =D"
"4.0","Food is good, and the service is excellent. It's expensive but you get a nice meal in a really comfortable space. The menu isn't big. If you like spicy food, you'll love the shrimp diavolo. Pizza is also good, but I like Proper's pizza better."
"4.0","Went there with my hubby for his birthday and we were pleasantly surprised. The sushi chef is actually Japanese, and you can really tell from the quality and authenticity of the food. The miso soup is REAL miso soup, not that watered down powdered stuff with tiny bits of chopped up tofu that you get in a lot of Japanese restaurants.You won't find anything too fancy on the menu as most of the offerings are pretty standard fare for a Japanese restaurant. For an appetizer we had the beef tataki which was very flavorful. We had the sushi lover for two with 28 pieces of maki and nigiri. It came with two pieces of the fattiest fatty tuna (toro) that I have EVER seen and it literally melted in my mouth! I've eaten a lot of sushi in my life and I was absolutely shocked. We finished off our meal with some fried ice cream in a yummy smooth red bean sauce. The server was really nice too and knew the menu really well. Overall we left extremely satisfied - it helped that we had a $25 restaurant.com certificate (otherwise it would have been too pricey to try the place). It was very high quality and authentic sushi, as well as a pleasant dining experience. I think this place is highly underrated, probably because of the high prices and shopping mall location, but next time you're craving great Japanese food, get yourself a restaurant certificate and try it out!"
"5.0","Best bartenders in Pittsburgh, in my opinion. The bar doesn't have a TV, which allows for actual conversation. The music is always good. The vibe is definitely lively without being clubby. Mt. Washington is lucky to have it!"
"5.0","I can't just can't get enough of MR Bulgogi. I have a soft spots for food trucks, but out of all the options in Pittsburgh, MR Bulgogi is special. I have had both the bulgogi and pork bowls and both are so great. The bulgogi is perfectly cooked and incredibly flavorful and the sauces and sauce on the pork is next level. They're both so good, I'd recommend getting the half and half option. There is plenty of sticky rice in the bowls and lettuce in the sauces so you will be filled up. Each bowl is served with a dumpling and it's worth adding the side of dumplings and throwing them on top of your bowl or splitting with someone else to throw on your bowl. The kimchi is also another great side that I'd recommend throwing on top. MR Bulgogi is always awesome and you will not be disappointed!"
"2.0","Suffice it to say, this is not real Italian food and it's below average and overpriced when it comes to American-Italian food. The staff was excellent though and you will have great service and conversation. Thanks but probably won't be back."
"5.0","Great friendly service, bamboo bowl with chicken was steaming hot. Clean refreshing decor! Gluten free menu (allergen) to help with selection."
"1.0","Since I was a kid I would always ask my mom to order these for me cause they were my favorite, this place was always the best pizza place hands down! After tonight made me feel sick I went to cut one in half and it looked like slime spilling out of the rolls!!! Don't come here to order rolls they can't tell if it's fully cooked! Looks like I will finding my new spot!"
"5.0","I've never been here before but stopped when my daughter recommend it. The burger was cooked perfectly and tasted really good.  Cool, modern atmosphere. Friendly staff. I would highly recommend a burger and beer from here."
"4.0","I've had a lot of Indian food from different restaurants around the Pittsburgh area and this is by far my favorite place. The staff is friendly and accomodating. My gf is a vegetarian and when she asked for veggie curry, which wasn't on the menu, they said it was no problem for the chef to cook up. The entrees are the perfect portion and the garlic naan is incredible. If you have any room left, try a mango lassi."
"1.0","Long time customer... 3/22/14 officially no longer a customer. They charge you for an XL pizza, '16 slices' and give you a LARGE pizza in a smaller box. Took a long time but now a SELL OUT pizza shop. Hope the rest of the Southside Community stays away from Gennaros. Sad day for a pizza lover."
"4.0","I'm always excited to try new places in the strip district and this one did not disappoint! On a busy Sunday, we were through the line and seated quickly and our food wasn't far behind. Everyone in my group got something different and it was rave reviews all around. For simple sandwiches and breakfast I thought it was a little pricy, but truly the experience was great and there are so many menu options I'd like to try that I'll be back again soon!"
"5.0","Was visiting Pittsburgh area for a training and the team wanted to try Sushi. Not a very good choice for a vegetarian. However I was pleasantly surprised with the Vegetarian Sushi options that they had. I  would definitely recommend to any of the vegetarians out there."
"2.0","The prices are way too high for what you get.  The Bruco & Shrimp entree costs $26, yet the dish wasn't anything special.  The pasta was soft and the sauce was bland, although the shrimp were definitely plump.  We also ordered the Duck Breast, which was better, but the proportions were odd.  The bed of mashed potatoes that the duck was laid on was disproportionately huge, which might be great for people who want volume but not so much for people expecting a balanced dish.The space and ambiance is charming, save for some questionable artwork.  Our waiter was a bit strange, although I won't hold it against the restaurant because he might have been new.  In addition to flubbing our order a bit, he asked us if we wanted cheese once the pasta dish came out, grated maybe 1/4 teaspoon of cheese (no exaggeration), and declared 'that's good' and left. Again, the food is ok and there wasn't anything overtly negative about our experience, but the price/value proposition means I really can't recommend this place."
"4.0","Love the food here. Wasn't real sure about the 'healthy' menu, but have been quite surprised. No, it's not a fancy place --- it's a cafe, not a full restaurant. Have tried a variety of soups, and sandwiches, been pleased with everything.(how is it possible to make a vegan Reuben that tasted better than the real thing?)"
"1.0","Just paid a visit Saturday evening after hearing about this place for almost a year. When we arrived, we got to be told to seat ourselves at the bar by a cold-faced waitress. The bartender didn't bother to serve, either. Instead, we had nice conversations with a random guy sitting next to us. We ended up with paying nearly 100 for two but won't come back since their business is too good to have two more of us. Also if you wanna have your mood ruined, go talk to the reception girl!"
"5.0","I got my Sushi Grade Tuna today as PROMISED!Thanks for the great service even if I am to old to get to you. I have been enjoying your food and your beautiful employees over the years.Pete Flarety was our mayor back then.Thank You n your family for being great neighbors I am Pittsburgh Proud of Your Business!!!"
"1.0","Used to like this place. Ordered the same thing everytime and it was usually correct. Used to get the cheese breadsticks until the website didn't offer that item specifically. Added notes and they didn't get the order correct. Girl at the front desk argued that there was nothing she could do. They charged me extra for something I didn't even want and didn't care. Their customer service sucks. And the food quality is mediocre at best. Wouldn't recommend at all."
"5.0","This restaurant has a great selection of food. It's not a huge menu. But it has plenty and they change it according to the season. Very fresh. Everything is cooked perfectly. Everything tastes amazing. I love this place. It's not as small as it appears. There is an upstairs. For the quality of the food the price is really reasonable."
"5.0","We recently attended Bloomfield's Little Italy Days for the first time.   When we arrived, we walked the entire circuit to decide what to eat.   I wanted a booth that was affiliated with a local restaurant and not just some generic Italian food truck that has a bunch of identical ones there and travels to every festival.   I noticed the restaurant Sausalido and a block or so up the street they had a booth with two offerings - stuffed meatballs or a pasta dish with feta cheese.  We both opted for the meatballs which had red and green peppers, bacon, Romano cheese and some other things.   We each got two large meatballs.   The sauce on them was delicious and they weren't drowning in it.   We were both satisfied with how filling they were and opted to get ice cream instead of looking for another food item.  (Graeter's has an ice cream truck there - OMG!).  We can't wait to come back for a meal at Sausalido's Restaurant."
"3.0","I want to like this place but I never leave super impressed. Bloody Mary's are okay but can get pretty expensive with ad ons. They offer oyster Bloody Mary shooters, not my thing but maybe it's yours. Shrimp po boy was just okay. Lobster fries are good. I heard their sushi is tasty but a little pricey."
"4.0","I am a big fan of this restaurant. Definite hole in the wall family run operation. The service is great and the food is fresh and consistent. The portions are large - they don't skimp on meat and the prices are reasonable/cheap.Of the appetizers I recommend siamese kisses, thai samosas, and satay chicken. Ive tried a few different curries (red, green, panang) and some noodle dishes. Nothing disappoints!! I always have left overs for lunch the next day.The girls that run this place really know what they are doing. I am eating a take out order right now and wrote this review solely due to the surprise homemade brownie they gave me with my chicken red curry. My meal is delicious, even though I ordered a 6 and my mouth is burning - fire or not, this dish has tons of flavor. The brownie is gooey and delicious too!"
"5.0","I absolutely love the strip district in Pittsburgh. It feels kind of like you're in the scene when Rocky is running through the Italian market in Philly. These people are related to the Wholey's fish market people down the street, but the two businesses are not affiliated. With that said, the food was incredibly fresh and everything was seasoned perfectly. The outdoor dining set up with the removable back wall was in place and made for a lovely little afternoon snack. Definitely a must try if you're in the mood for good fish while in Pittsburgh."
"5.0","I love this space! It's so beautiful, and of course the tea and baked goods are wonderful. Sandwiches and salads are made with care when ordered. So glad to see this place in the neighborhood. Highly recommend!!"
"2.0","Service is satisfactory. I had a chicken cranberry walnut salad. The salad was below average as it was served with iceberg lettuce and little amount of walnuts.  No bread is served with the salad but the price was fair for $6.99 what do you expect! Their soups are very good."
"5.0","You'll walk in for two and end up having four. Incredibly delicious tacos at a great little shop found hidden among a slew of deep fried dives and bars. Just walking in is a breath of fresh air. Service is excellent and it's fun watching this guy rock out these tasty tacos. Loved it and will be back time and again."
"5.0","Be warned that the entrance is tricky to spot! I came here around 9pm on a Saturday and we were seated right away. We chose to sit at the bar so we could watch the chef prepare food, which was definitely a good choiceWe started with the takoyaki (octopus balls). The only other time I had takoyaki was homemade at a friend's house, so I had pretty high expectations, but this dish was amazing! It was served with this delicious Japanese mayo, and the balls themselves were crunchy on the outside, but a soft burst of flavor on the inside. A must try!For my entree I had the Yaki Udon, which was also very good, though not as memorable as the takoyaki. I loved how colorful the bowl was, and all the flavors blended nicely. All of the staff were very friendly and welcoming, and I liked how vegetarian options were clearly marked (there were plenty). I will be back!"
"5.0","I'm gonna miss this place now that I'm not going to work downtown anymore. The 'Famous Special' with sauerkraut on marble rye was my favorite. Really really good."
"4.0","This place is straightforward and no frills.  They have sandwiches and salads.  It is quick and not a chain, so that seems to hit a lot of points just there.  Very good sides as well.Not many straight up delis downtown, this is the best option"
"5.0","La Gourmadine is one of the best French bakeries in the city and I was thrilled to have the opportunity to visit it downtown now located where the Penn Ave fish market was previously housed.This is the 4th location of this established business with the other 3 located in Lawrenceville, Mt Lebanon, and Hazelwood. The menu is identical to the other three with coffee and expresso drinks available.My favorite pastry is their famed almond covered danish but haven just ate decided to settle for a couple of their macaroons. One was chocolate banana flavored and the other was strawberry. Believe me, it did not disappoint and with the flaky crust literally tore apart as I ate it. So good!!This location is extremely small but they have a gender neutral restroom. Free WiFi is available. Passcode is on one of their chalkboards. They have a small seating area which I have found to be true in their other locations as well.Want lunch? Yes, they still have their hoagie style sandwiches you would find at the other locations. They also have a daily quiche. The only major difference is that this location gets most of their products from the Hazelwood location. Few items are made in house. Prices have gone up slightly but still very reasonable for the quality of food you get here.Take out as always is available. I did chat with one of the counter persons who waited on me because I wanted to find out why the are only open on weekdays. Basically this location caters to the working since their hours pretty much match working hours. They are closed Sat and Sun. He did tell me that they had recently opened and may consider expanding into weekends if there is enough draw.It is my hope that they do. I normally don't go to town during the week unless absolutely necessary and this would be a great spot to get a great sandwich or if you are daring one of their French gourmet breakfast pastries. Refrigerated items are also available along with some breads.Located on Forbes Ave near Cardamone's beauty parlor there is construction on that side of Forbes if you are headed down from Smithfield St."
"1.0","This place is ridiculous. They are rude & I have no idea why they close before 2am. That is prime time. You guys are losing out on money and that's Taco Bell's problem."
"3.0","Ahh, CMU food. So besides the fact that on campus food is a disaster for the most part, this cafe actually holds it ground in some areas. The milkshakes here are probably the most popular, because as college students, what worse can you do to your body other than sleeping late, eating unhealthy foods and partying? Well, dumping more calories and sugar into your body certainly can help. But in all seriousness, the milkshakes here are pretty good, and they have lots of flavor options. However, as is with most on campus services, you have to wait 15 to even 30 minutes for something that takes about 2 minutes to make. Some menu items here are passable, like their BBQ patty and their popcorn shrimp. Their wings are ok, depending on whether or not your worker forgets about the deep frying cage. The place also opens pretty late which is useful for students who are trying to grab something to eat late into the night.But yeah, this place is as ok as any on campus place can get."
"4.0","Freshii is a great healthy lunch option for anyone working up on Grant St. Freshii offers bowls, wraps, salads, and smoothies. While the prices are on the higher end, the ingredients are quality and noticeable. I prefer the bamboo bowl and the sauce adds a ton of flavor and keeps the bowl from being 'dry'.  If you are looking to order a smoothie, I would not order as my meal. Although the price is high and indicates that it could be a standalone meal, it would not be filling enough."
"5.0","My daughter introduced us to this place.  It is very small with limited seating, don't let that deter you.  This are the best tacos in the area.  They have flour or corn tortillas and daily specials.  I always get the special and I am always glad with the choice.  There are meat and veggie options.  One of my favorites was a cauliflower taco with a pineapple glaze.  This is a hidden gem in Pittsburgh's Southside."
"4.0","Great little nano-brewery. Quality beers and a nice vibe. Super nice and helpful staff. Good place to grab lunch and a beer in a fun neighborhood."
"5.0","Amazing food, amazing artwork and awesome people making and serving everything. I would recommends this place to anyone trying to anyone whose trying to give themselves a delicious treat."
"4.0","Midmorning on a Sunday, we had to wait about fifteen minutes for a table for 5. The kids had pancakes and waffles. The teenager nearly passed out from happiness over the chocolate chip waffle. The three year old had to closely protect his pancake because his mother and I kept stealing bites whenever he let his guard down. I had a chorizo hash special. It wasn't spicy, but neither was it underspiced and I enjoyed it to the last bite.It wasn't diner prices, but I felt like it was fair.While we waited, we stood over vent outside Prantl's to stay warm and enjoy the bakery aroma."
"5.0","This is going to be a short review because Capital Grill is always exceptional. There is no need for me to critique the food or service. Everything on the menu is unsurpassed. It is accordingly expensive and so caters to high end clientele and business people trying to reward or impress clients or a special occasion date night. If you want a terrific dining experience there is no better place. I strongly recommend it and would certainly return as I have several times."
"2.0","My family of twelve went to Jerome bettis's grill because we had the biggest and best Mac and cheese we ever had. It was full of bacon and very delicious. Two of us ordered it again this time, but it was just ordinary Mac and cheese with a little dab of bacon. Very disappointing. The other meals were okWould not be going back."
"4.0","I've been wanting to stop in here for the last few months since I go to a hair salon across the street. I finally managed to go on a Thursday afternoon about 2:15pm. Since it was off peak, there were only a few tables with guests & no one at the bar. I sat at the bar since I was alone. I was asked if I had any questions about the beer & didn't realize they brewed their own & had a restaurant (and their brewery) in Zelienople, who knew? They gave me a taste (a rather large taste I might add in these cute tiny Pilsner glasses) of their ale & IPA and both were delicious. I ordered the Maggie's Farm burger which came with Gouda, horseradish, carmelized onions, roasted chilies & rum aioli. You could really tell that it was a fresh made burger & the horseradish & chilies gave it a good kick. The bun was soft, and the fries were fresh cut & plentiful. They also have rosemary fries for $1 more. I look forward to visiting their Zelienople location soon & was told they plan to expand to the old Mellon Bank Building on Main St & will eventually have a rooftop deck!Returned early June: On Thursdays they have $4 house wine by the glass all day. Red is a Merlot, White is a Pinot Grigio. I choose the white & it was a nice dry not too fruity wine that was perfect for 4 bucks. I chose the Fox Chapel which features 'the blend' which is a combo of beef & mushrooms in the burger, plus goat cheese, greens, onion, avocado & balsamic. It came with a lot of hand cut fries. The burgers remind me of one you'd make yourself at home. Not fancy or huge, but tasty & just enough. It's worth a stop for a burger. Returned again Oct 25, 2018: Sorry to report that this time I left without ever getting even a drink! Why? I must have been invisible. After giving Burgh'ers 5 stars twice I felt obligated to let management know that even if servers are busy they should always acknowledge a customer's presence. This was an off peak time, 2:15pm on a Thursday. I had 45 minutes to grab lunch before an appointment. I sat at the bar. There were 2 tables & one other couple at the bar. There was a woman who evidently worked there sitting at the bar working on a laptop near kitchen. There was one male server working the bar & tables. Both the woman & man appeared behind the bar twice. But I sat at the bar for 12 minutes. No one made eye contact or acknowledged I was there. Ridiculous. So I left. If this had been my first visit I'd give zero stars. But since I had 2 previously good visits I am just taking one star away & saying Burgh'ers please improve your customer service!"
"5.0","For authentic Mexican, can not find a better spot! Tacos are the best hands down and the home made queso and chips.... just wow"
"2.0","Decided to eat here and have a couple beers while my wife was gambling. To make a long story short. The pretzel bites were hard as a rock. The wings weren't horrible, but they put cold sauce on the wings without heating it which of course made the wings cold. The Staff is very friendly, but very inattentive and unorganized. On a positive note, the flamethrower sauce was good on the wings. Unfortunately it felt like I was eating wings I just pulled out of the refrigerator."
"4.0","The food is very flavorful. With a preference for spiciness, I often can find many tasteful dishes here. Also, the lunch is very cheap and offers some good varieties."
"5.0","Fantastic wrap! $7 lunch special included chicken bacon ranch wrap, chips and home made lemonade! Friendly service and excellent food. Can't wait to come back for the ice cream"
"3.0","The sushi was amazing. I ordered unagi, steelers roll, shadyside roll, and shrimp roll. It was all very Fresh. And delicious. The chefs are on point here. However, my water glass went 30 minutes being empty. After drinking the remaining, it still went empty... sitting for 5 minutes waiting for the check was a bit ridiculous as well. Mind you, there was only about 6 other tables. 2 chefs (hats off to them) and about 7 servers. So my review is very tipsy. If you want amazing fresh sushi, check it out, just be weary you may be there a while waiting for refills or your check."
"1.0","This was my first time at this restaurant and it was a horrible experience. Over an hour long wait, tandoori items were not available as the tandoor was broken. Never coming back."
"5.0","Not having ordered anything from here other than breakfast or burgers (which I highly recommend--though they're only served outside in the summer), I treated myself to the 'Porkgasm' sandwich today.  I was disappointed when my sandwich was handed to me, as it felt a bit lighter than the sandwiches I get elsewhere.  However, when I got back to my desk and had my Porkgasm--er, ate my Porkgasm sandwich--I was more than okay with trading volume for quality.  It was a delicious sandwich and I'll be back to sample the rest of the menu.UPDATE:  Craftwork started grilling tacos outside recently and these are also AWESOME.  I'm a taco traditionalist, but I enjoy the hell out of the Pescado Baja (Mahi Mahi) tacos as well as the Carne Asada (steak) and Pollo Tradicional (chicken).  Yes, these tacos are pricier than the Qdoba variety, but also much, much better."
"4.0","Pretty good pizza, but I wouldn't say anything spectacular. I have found the buffalo chicken pizza is their best. They top it with fried potato slices which is unique and delicious. Pizza generally takes 30 to 45 minutes from when you place your order to your door."
"5.0","Doce always a great spot. 3$ tacos and a rotating special tacos. Love this place writing this review makes me hungry just thinking about them tastie tacos.Best tacos you'll ever eat out!"
"4.0","Cool vibe.  Cool place with good service.  Tacos are great.  I'd say a notch better than the overrated Tako but a notch below the flavor of Bakersfield.They have beef, veg, chicken, and carnitas as well as a rotating special.  Will be back for sure!  The Cholula crema on top is amazing."
"2.0","I expected more for the price. My fianc√©e ordered the pork chop to find it was dry and the size was too big for his liking. I ordered the hanger steak and feel that the steak did not have enough flavor. My fianc√©e loved the beets house salad. The lack of salt and spices in our dish is what made us give this place two stars."
"3.0","This restaurant has good sushi but that's about it. It lacks decor and service. My family dined there on a Tuesday night and were the only people there when we placed our orders. My husband asked if it was ok to substitute two pieces of shellfish with either salmon or tuna. Waitress said it would cost $2 extra for each piece! And that the kitchen had everything prepared. What restaurant 'pre-makes' sushi!? My son also wanted a side of teriyaki sauce and they charged us .25 for it. Really? We spent over $85 for dinner and you really want to charge me .25 for a side of sauce? Your 'extras' will cost you more when your customers stop coming back."
"4.0","Your typical breakfast diner in Shadyside to escape the hustle of Pitt campus. Eggs were nicely prepared and the pancakes hit the spot for our college student. A good go to when visiting."
"5.0","My husband and I came here this past Saturday night after a show at the Byham due to the kitchen closing at 11pm at our hotel. It wasn't crowded and even better the kitchen was open. The drinks were great. Even the iced tea my husband got was fresh brewed and not sitting around all night. I got the pierogi plate. They were just perfect. The serving size was great for a late night bite. Each pierogi had its own butter-sauteed red onion ring on it. The sour cream being in the middle helped keep it cold and not melting like some places. My husband had the Greek salad. The feta vinaigarette dressing was so good he was dipping his pita pieces into it and eating them that way. The salad was fresh and he cleaned his plate. We got the Noble Cheesecake for dessert. The texture was very smooth and silky. It was a chocolate caramel swirl topped with whipped cream and a chocolate drizzle. I would definitely take friends here for a late night bite or dinner and drinks during the game."
"5.0","Best sandwiches in the Burgh. Service was excellent and fast considering everything is made to order. Fresh ingredients. Friendly staff. Thanks to Lou and crew for operating a Pittsburgh tradition!"
"5.0","this is such a nice place I like to go to, I think their omelettes and lattes are the best in town. and the owners are really very friendly and hard workers.They recently remade the patio and those colorful umbrellas look just phenomenal. I feel so peaceful sitting in that patio and eat my delicious breakfast on Saturday mornings.  if you didn't try this place before you definitely should because I think you're missing a lot."
"5.0","Loved this place! Stumbled upon it when visiting Pittsburgh. Funky decor and great happy hour options! Melissa was our awesome waitress and gave us tons of thoughtful suggestions of places and activities to check out during our visit! She's a great representation of this business!"
"5.0","Was here in the spring and thought the food was excellent.  My mom got a salad and father got the famous fish sandwich which were both awesome! Great atmosphere sitting outside and had great service.  I would highly recommend it!"
"2.0","I was pretty disappointed. My boyfriend was too. We went here for dinner after hearing good things about their breakfast. We both felt like we were paying $20 for something that could have come from a $1 can (certainly seemed like it). Nothing really tasted like much, there wasn't really any depth of flavor to anything, nothing was interesting. Both of our dishes (the seafood paella and the galinha) were supposed to have sausage in it.  The galinha has one piece (about the size of a quarter of a slice of pepperoni) and the paella had none. Would not recommend, at least not for dinner.I've been for coffee and they sell good coffee."
"4.0","Great value!! Food is excellent and prices are cheap!!Love their red curry!!!This and Bangkok balcony are my favorite Thai places in the burgh!"
"5.0","I came here on a Saturday afternoon on a whim and I will definitely recommend it to someone looking for a good brunch place. I ordered the Hawaiian burger and at first, I was expecting it to be dry but it ended up being very juicy and delicious. It had a tiny bit of a sweet flavor to it which I really enjoyed. I'm not a big potato fan but I enjoyed eating theirs. We sat on the second floor and would have sat outside on the balcony if it wasn't as hot. Definitely would come back again!"
"5.0","Awesome tacos! Have decent vegan option which was the saviour for my friend. I totally enjoyed the chicken option. We ordered Nacho's on the side which were also very very good. Overall a very good Mexican place to eat especially since it's open late night also."
"5.0","My absolute favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh!  Great staff and amazing food!  A must stop destination in the Strip. Kevin my server is great!"
"4.0","A good hole the wall bar to frequent with nice people and the food is decent. I would recommend the calzones to new people, pasta is good, pizza is alright. Drinks are reasonably priced."
"4.0","What's to like but also what's to hate? I also have a theory this place doesn't really exist and anyone you see in there is a ghost. It reminds me of the bar in Flashdance except without fun or dancing. 4 stars for being haunted and cheap and weird."
"5.0","Best tikka in Pittsburgh and best mint chutney I've ever had.  Hot sauce lacks creativity and they should make more vegetarian dishes. I've been going here for more than 18 years. Owner is super nice and this place is popular among university and hospital crowds.  Delivery deal for two meals isn't too shabby.  Good biryanis if you order from the chef... owner has admitted to me it is his favorite thing to eat."
"4.0","This place has great food and service. It's also huge and has lots of seats. Do yourself a favor and stop by for lunch one day. They have a large selection of food and even have burgers and cheese steaks if you have someone in the group that would rather have that. The meat shawarma was pretty good and reasonably priced. I have not had a bad meal there yet."
"1.0","This place is awful.  Servers were having an unfriendly 'discussion' upon our arrival and continued in our presence. Floors were filthy. Service was poor at best. Food was worse than service. No way I'll be back. Too bad b/c atmosphere is pretty decent."
"4.0","Went here the other night. Our waitress was very nice and the food was good. Plus the smiley face cookies are just adorable so.."
"4.0","Alexander's is good, solid Italian food without any pretentiousness. Their menu is large, but not outrageously expansive like a lot of other local Italian restaurants in the area. There's a nice selection of Italian favorites, plus you have the ability to create your own past dish (choose your pasta, type of sauce, and add-ons).I've been to Alexander's several times for lunch and always enjoyed it, so I decided to take my girlfriend there for dinner on a recent night. When we entered, we were warmly greeted by the staff and asked where we wanted to sit. We sat in the front of the house/bar area so I could keep an eye on the Pirates game. While there, I overheard an older lady complaining that her dish was less than stellar. The server and the manager agreed with her assessment and offered to make her anything else on the menu to make her happy. I've always been pleased by the pleasant, accommodating nature of the staff when I've visited Alexander's; it's truly a strong point of the restaurant.I ordered the pork osso bucco with garlic risotto, while my girlfriend went with chicken parmigiano. We opened with bruschetta toast. It was a nice start. The tomatoes were fresh, and the taste of balsamic vinegar gave it a little pop of flavor. I then had their wedding soup, which is always enjoyable. It's full of meat and has just the right level of saltiness to it. My girlfriend was pleased with her garden salad; in particular, she enjoyed the flavor and texture added by walnuts and cranberries.The pork osso bucco I received was huge. Unfortunately, the flavor was not as big as the size of the dish. The pork was tender and properly cooked... the garlic risotto, not so much. It was just kind of bland. Together, the dish was fairly tasty, but not something that I would order again. My girlfriend was pleased with her massive serving of chicken parmigiano and pasta. It was good, but the breading was a little soggy because it was doused in sauce.Somewhere during the course of our dinner, the manager walked from table to table, and asked every group if they wanted a loaf of Italian bread. I suppose that they had a lot of extra bread and were giving it out since the night was winding down. I heartily accepted- their bread is delicious. Little things like this are why I love Alexander's.If you're looking for some tasty Italian food served in a friendly, welcoming atmosphere, you can't go wrong with Alexander's. Just stick with the pasta, and you'll be happy."
"5.0","I cannot believe how much food I got for $9! At least 2 meals worth! So good too...chicken tikka masala and spinach paneer. I can't wait to go back and try more!"
"3.0","Crowded! This place was packed with people sitting and standing so much so that it's difficult to walk through. Our waitress was very nice but never brought one of our apps and kept disappearing for long periods of time. She was very enthusiastic when we asked how different dishes were before ordering which made me change my order. The food was good. Wings, good sauce. Nachos, huge. Deep fried burger, meh. Gorgonzola salad, yum. For some reason When we got our bill there were a couple things on it that we didn't order and had to have the waitress remove which took her 30 minutes to do. Definitely not a place for a quick bite but if you're there to watch a game the food is pretty good for bar food."
"5.0","This place is great, has the best lunch specials in town.  With Kourtney behind the bar, you can't go wrong."
"4.0","Great price, fast service, and a delicious chicken sandwich!  How can you go wrong?  One tip: order one heat level lower than what you think you might want. The heat builds. UPDATE: Since opening, this place has seemingly shrunk the thickness of the chicken breasts in the sandwiches. As far as I can tell, they're about half as thick now, which throws off the meat/bread ratio of the sandwich. Dropping one star..."
"5.0","We ordered a gyro and it was yummy. It was unique in that it was almost closer to a burrito, it was good! I definitely recommend this place as the inside is pristinely clean with a touch of class. I can't wait to try their lunch buffet!"
"4.0","The delivery was a little on the slow side and they accidently gave me the wrong drinks but the wait was worth it. The pizza was HUGE and it was delicious, one of the best pizza shops in steel city!!"
"3.0","Great place for a quick bite and very pocket-friendly and nice and fast service.The only complaint I have in the inconsistency on the spice level. Some days, the mild is all sugary and some days too spicey. Same for the medium level. Today I noticed that one of the cooks added the spices in the chicken marinated bowls by freehand and he also had to run in between to check e fryers. Some consistency would be nice.Overall, I highly recommend this place for anyone craving fried chicken. They use peanut oil for frying which is great."
"5.0","Nelly was our server tonight and she was absolutely phenomenal! She was on top of everything and we got our drinks and food in a timely manner. Food was also great!"
"5.0","As a lover of Nashville hot chicken. I have to say this is the best I've had in Pittsburgh by far. Also the pickles are bomb!"
"4.0","Great experience here - and I really enjoyed my food. My husband, toddler and I went for lunch. We got the falafel wrap, chicken shawarma wrap, chicken nuggets, fries, baklava and samosas. I thought the food was really good - although my falafel wrap had a little of a weird taste to it. Also, we ordered tabouleh - but it never arrived with our food, and by the time we realized, we had already tossed the receipt. I will definitely return and I'm looking forward to trying other items."
"5.0","Not only is the pizza hella good the service is AMAZING!!! I left my entire purse on the table on a Friday night And the employees who knew it  was mine did not allow the drunks to steal it. I came back and they were like 'wow TG I had to defend ur shit from drunks' GENEROS SAVE MY LIFE !!!!"
"4.0","Strawberry crepes are light as air and delicious!Be prepared to wait a while to be seated , but it's well worth the best breakfast in the Burgh! This location has absolutely sterile decor. We only went because the strip was so packed .Go for the food , you'll be happy ."
"4.0","First impression...everything is very red.  But that's just the lighting.  Japanese bar food?  Okay...I'm in.  Cool venue.  The tables are too close together to be a date night.  That seems to be a trend.  I don't like that trend.  We went all over the menu.  Drinks, apps, a giant whole fish with its head still on, its cold dead eyes staring up at our drunken faces appetizingly.  It was good.  Don't get that though.  It was...problematic to pick around the bones with chopsticks.  Loved our waitress.  Like...literally loved her.  It was hard to leave.  She hasn't called.  Great service, spoke some japanese even.  Very laid back atmosphere.  Cool and new and fun and well done.  Sake selection was awesome.  Ex-PEN-sive.  My sister took me for my birthday and my only hope is that she forgets how much it cost before her birthday in May."
"5.0","Wow. Sausalido gets an A++ rating from me. I went to this restaurant for the first time to celebrate a birthday. (FYI-this location is BYOB). While trying to figure out what we wanted to eat, our waitress brought out bread and bean dip. Holy Moly--it was at this point that I knew that I was in for a great meal. We asked for entree suggestions and she also suggested the Gouda appetizer. Trust me when I say, it did not disappoint. I ordered the Butternut Squash Ravioli and my friends ordered the Flank Steak and the Crab Cakes. There was not a bite of food left on any of our plates. Our waitress was so sweet. When we sat down she asked if we were celebrating anything special. At the end of our meal she brought out a pumpkin dessert for our friend. Again, amazing. My friend now wants to get her wedding catered by Sausalido--I can only hope that I am invited! :-)"
"5.0","Omg the best burger and our waiter George is the best so knowledgeable and great service thank you !"
"5.0","It's a steak house so you expect good steak. And it was lovely (filet) as were the sides.  Service was attentive, no rush and helpful.  Ambience was traditional as you'd expect.  Nice evening"
"4.0","We had a private event here for about 25 people. The service was fantastic. The food was good as well as expected from this great chain. The event went off without a hitch even though we added more people last minute. Very excellent staff!"
"5.0","Really enjoyed it. Everything my family and I had was delicious. The nan  with garlic was outstanding. The restaurant was clean and the service was good. Only problem I had was parking."
"5.0","I have been looking for a real authentic Japanese restaurants in Pittsburgh for a long time. Most Japanese restaurants in Pittsburgh are not owned by Japanese. When I found Kiku, I was so excited to go and try their food! It's  located in Commerce Court which is right facing the indoor parking building. We got there around 6 and there were not many people. We decided to order steak tofu, veggie and shrimp tempura, sashimi platter, udon, and chirashi sushi rice bowl which is basically sashimi with rice underneath. Me and my roommate were so AMAZED about how fresh and delicious their sashimi was. Everything we ordered was so oishi!! We ended our night with match cheesecake and pudding. The pudding was just so refreshing because it's not too sweet and it had strong eggy taste which we love. People at Kiku were super friendly and helpful! I definitely would love to go back again!"
"4.0","This is such a cool spot. Really wide open space with lots of seating options, excellent tea, and love the sandwiches too. My favorite is an iced lavenade and a turkey sandwich. So refreshing!"
"1.0","Man o man......Don't eat here! If you read the reviews you will notice a recurring theme: wait staff sucks and plates are dirty.Perfect location, great space, patio is awesome. The servers were hanging out and I had to go to the bar to get our drinks because our server was bullshitting with the rest of the staff. Our app plates were dirty and when I got up and took them inside because our server was nowhere to be found, the servers congregating inside started laughing 'plates are dirty?!?'  Seems like a new dishwasher needs purchased. Food was mediocre at best. Go elsewhere."
"2.0","From the outside of the restauarant I was hoping for a cute, quirky place. Unfortunately, it was a very underwhelming, boring, and forgettable meal."
"3.0","Great drinks.  I don't fancy myself a drinker, but the drinks here are why this place is so highly rated.  The food is of a high caliber as well.  Ordered a cheese board and the pork belly ramen.    The food was good enough for a 3-star rating.  Great menu for a bar.  I recommend this place to go if you plan on drinking with friends.   Order some good food, a couple drinks share some laughs.  I was surprised that this place was not hipster.  Huzzah!"
"5.0","Greatest Burger (Lil Ray's Fatburger) was the greatest cheeseburger i have ever eaten, and service was amazing. Clean, fun atmosphere, too! Both Big Ray and Little Ray are awesome chefs, and I try to return there when ever i can!"
"5.0","While the 'hole in the wall' atmosphere isn't for everybody... the quality, authenticity, and portion sizes are. Amazing food prepared by a friendly family. Excellent service; never a bad experience in 5 years."
"5.0","Absolutely delicious tacos! And the service is very fast and efficient. Small place but good for a quick bite, especially after a night out in the south side! Good variety of soda as well."
"4.0","Chinatown Inn hasn't changed its decor or menu since I've started coming here, it hasn't changed since my mom and dad started coming here, and it's not likely to change anytime soon.  And that's the way we all like it.I came here with some of my union brothers and sisters after a training seminar.  We all had a hankering for some good old Americanized Chinese food and few other places around here could satisfy our cravings.  We all started out with some soups (I tried the egg flower-delicious) followed by a mix of appetizers such as vegetable rolls and steamed vegetable hand-rolled dumplings.  I went for the broccoli chicken, but we all did a little family style sharing of our dishes.  So we all did a little sampling of ginger and garlic shrimp, curry roast pork, and some vegetarian dishes.It was a great evening with some great colleagues.  Oh and my fortune cookie?  It said 'You are a person most generous.  Pay the check.'"
"5.0","I've been here 3 times now and everytime is equally as great as my last visit. It is by stage AE and sits alongside the river so it's a great place to go for a date or to eat before a concert.I hear they have a 32oz steak.. are you up for the challenge?"
"5.0","Rialto's is exactly as advertised - small pizza joint with a handful of other menu items like sandwiches and pasta, and a pretty decent beer selection. It's a staple for us here in Greenfield - we order here pretty regularly. The food is consistently good, though some items are better than others. Our go-to is the Hawaiian because the ham and bacon are so good. I love ordering from somewhere local vs a chain bc the food and the service are so much better. You won't find a texting teenager behind the register. If you're looking for a reliable place to get some quick Italian eats, I recommend you give Rialto's a shot!"
"5.0","I tried MR Bulgogi at the Pittsburgh taco festival and it was amazingly delicious. I had the beef taco and my friend had the pork and we split an order of fried dumplings. I think what really set everything off was the yummy sauces that complemented each item so perfectly. I also made sure to like the FB page so I can hopefully get to try them again sometime soon!!!"
"4.0","By far easily one of my top 3 places to order in from. Today I went though GrubHub and I had passed out before they got here. I understand I shouldn't have fallen asleep but it's based on a sickness. What I don't understand is why they can't leave it at the door that had ordered and paid for it? Thankfully Grubhub gave me a discount cause they're a great company, I'm just confused about all the work that it takes to drop off food at the door that bought it? I assume there's some kinda legal reason the drivers can't? Someone enlighten me."
"1.0","I ducked in for a quick takeaway lunch on a rainy Monday this week. I was the only customer in the store the entire time my meal was prepared. After ordering and paying for the 'Beta Kabob Sub,' I stood watching Rachael Ray's talk show for 15 minutes while the cashier and an older gentleman tinkered around the kitchen and adjusted fixtures above the stove with the tongs they would use to cook my food on the grill.Finally, the cashier threw some chunks of meat on the cooking surface.The result was a decent piece of bread filled with a handful of dry, chewy nuggets of sinewy meat.Fries are included with the 'Beta Kabob Sub,' so I figured the cashier had slipped them into the frier during a particularly riveting sequence on Rachael Ray's talk show. No. He waited until putting together my entire sub, slicing, and wrapping it, before asking whether I wanted the fries that are included with the meal. This added some additional unwanted time to an already ridiculously long wait. They did not have any bags for me to carry out my sub in, but they did try to mitigate the terrible service by offering a napkin.Wait time for a single overcooked Beta Kabob Sub: 30 minutes."
"5.0","Definitely a front runner for best Thai in my book. Of course I got the Pumpkin Tofu Curry. If you have read any of my other reviews  you may notice that's all I get at Thai restaurants. It's not because I'm afraid to try anything else - it's that it is SO good to me that I would regret not getting it ever. But I have a little thing going here - maybe someday I will be the Pumpkin Tofu Curry expert.Anyway, this was my 3rd time eating here. The first time we got takeout and were so pleased with everything. The second time we ate-in and had a great experience as well, so we went back 5 days later. (OK, we might be addicts.) Last night when we went we both got the Fresh tofu spring rolls to start and each got the pumpkin curry. The spring rolls were large, fresh and delicious. The dipping sauce was perfection. I ordered tofu as usual, Forest ordered chicken. We both stepped up the spice level to a 7. It was perfect. The tofu here is the best I've had: generous portions, great texture. The pumpkin was perfect and they also add carrots, peas and peppers to the mix. The spice level was good for me - a little heat, but not overwhelming.The staff is awesome - super sweet and friendly. They replenish rice as soon as it looks like your getting low, and service is really fast. I love this place. It is my current fave. My only beef is that they don't have brown rice as an option - but honestly it doesn't matter because they're that good."
"4.0","I had a pretty positive experience here - the service was wonderful and the meat (lamb) was really well cooked."
"4.0","Tried Redbeards today for the first time. The place was pretty busy but I was able find a seat at the bar. The bartender seemed friendly and energetic when he greater me. I was happy to learn that they serve raspberry ice tea and decided on the Ballpark Burger with a side salad after reviewing the menu. While waiting for my burger I took in the atmosphere. Six TVs lined the walls behind the bar; all on mute playing sports stations or TNT. The walls adorn Pittsburgh sports art. Contrasting that was the dim, almost too dim, lighting. It's hard to tell whether they're going for a sports bar or contemporary romantic feel. Of course I notice how well stocked the bar was and what a nice selection of craft beers that they have on tap. Oddly enough, my burger came out before the salad. No real issue for me but I think it does reflect a small hiccup in the kitchen. This was easily forgiven though by the quality of burger that was served. It was dense and juicy without making the bun all soggy. The bacon on it was thick and chewy, not that cheap, thin stuff that some places try pass off to cut cost with. The burger was topped with provolone cheese, lettuce, onion, tomato and pickle. Well worth the $11.00 they charge for it. The salad that I had afterwards was mostly lettuce with two slices of cucumber, two slices of onion, two cherry tomatoes and two pepperoncini's. In the corner of the dish there was some sliced up black olives... I had to wonder that if you were to put the slices of olives back together, would they combine to make of two whole olives? The southwest dressing that I got with it had a nice zest to it and everything on the salad was super fresh.Despite some of its idiosyncrasies, Redbeards gets a big thumbs up from me. I felt I got a good value for the meal that I enjoyed and I wouldn't hesitate to suggesting it as a meeting place for the next ball game or show that I go to in the Cultural District."
"5.0","I absolutely love eating here for lunch downtown! It's one of the few outdoor spaces around here and I always enjoy my meal along with the whole experience. They have many different sandwich and salad options-- burgers, grilled chicken, Caesar salads and more. Last time I went here, they had a strawberry basil lemonade that was wonderful to drink while sitting out in the sun near the calming sounds of the waterfall.I have never been here for happy hour, but I know it is on Wednesdays and they have food and drink specials, along with live music!"
"4.0","This place is one of my favorites for delivery! Their pizza crust has a great flavor and is cooked perfectly. The pizza has yet to be greasy at all. I also like their salads alot. I was worried their garden salad was going to be a container of iceberg lettuce as you often get at pizza places, but it actually had vegetables on it and was green lettuce, not iceberg! The only reason I give them 4 stars and not 5, is there are limited choices and when ordering a salad you do not get a choice of dressing, although the dressing that came was great! I highly recommend this place for great delivery!"
"5.0","George was amazing! The venue was packed, in that everyone was waiting for the impending Steeler game.  As soon as we were seated, we were greeted. Our drink order was taken and our appetizers placed with the kitchen. The entire visit mirrored the exceptional service and professionalism exhibited initially. We will most certainly be back. Oh, did I mention that the food was very very good? It was!!?"
"5.0","Passionate, caring and hardworking owner. Focused on customers, providing a warm and friendly atmosphere. Don't hesitate, go in and try the food for yourself, you won't regret."
"4.0","I always have the chicken curry and can't stop eating until I have finished everything. Always walk out of there feeling way too full. Today I decided to keep it light and have a lentil soup and tabbouleh. It was delicious and I am full again! How did that happen?"
"4.0","We came here for the lunch buffet last Sunday around 1pm, and I was really happy with our experience. It seemed like a small place, but the snowy weather probably kept it from being too crowded. Service was very good, they even bring roti to the table.I noticed the veggie dishes are kept at a separate station from meat dishes. I tried a little of each vegan dish, and really liked them all. They do have mango lassi on the buffet, which is pretty cool and I haven't seen elsewhere. I still think Coriander has them beat in quality, but it was a great deal ($8.99 on a Sunday) and I would gladly come back!"
"3.0","Freindly staff....good cheese....can't wait to try the aftermentioned '#7'"
"5.0","A great place with traditional Japanese cuisine and nice service, the sashimi, nigiri, and tempura are very good; everyone who likes Japanese cuisine should try it!"
"4.0","Gorgeous sunny Memorial Day and we had the absolute best service ever from George! He was so sweet and personable, especially with our 3 daughters and really took care of us. Delicious burger & turkey burger, grilled chicken was a little dry, bathrooms badly need a remodel. But because of George, we will be back!"
"3.0","This place needs renovation big time. Chai was tooo sweet! They brought a replacement on my request but I think it's pre-made,so I couldn't do much with it. My Samosa Chat wasn't great. I'll check it out again for a larger order."
"4.0","This was our third stop on our rainy day in the Burgh Brewery Tour.  We crossed the bridge from Millvale to seek out this newest brewery.  Crossing the river also meant crossing over to a top notch service experience and higher end d√©cor.  The place is bright and airy even though it's a narrow space.  We garnered a spot at the bar and ordered some beer and food.I tried the Stellar Peak and my 'better half' sampled the Kolsch beer.  I loved the IPA and sour fruit play on the Stellar and found it to be super refreshing and drinkable.  The Kolsch was really solid too.  For food, we ordered the Octopus for $15 that came on a bed of collard greens, navy beans, chimichurri, and pine nuts with a side of hushpuppies.  The dish was sort of lacking in flavor, sad to say, because it looked beautiful.  The octopus was grilled but not seasoned very well and the collard greens were sparse and cut too small to get a nice toothy bite.  The freshly made hushpuppies were sublime and we both thought they should create a dish featuring those with a dipping sauce as they truly could stand on their own.Our bartender was outstanding!  He was prompt and attentive to us while serving up armloads of beer, crafting cocktails that looked divine, and slinging food orders. We will definitely be back!"
"4.0","Good Food and all but the wait time is bit high and the restaurant is made out of like old wooden house which is kinda unpleasant for me but smart"
"4.0","I had dinner here several weeks ago and really enjoyed the food.  Perfect cup of chai along with channa dal and spinach paneer with garlic naan.  My friend had some type of lamb sausage which were on skewers.  The spices were surprisingly subtle but still absolutely delicious with a warm vinaigrette on the side.  The service was by no means terrible but having waited tables myself I know it could have been slightly better.  Overall we enjoyed everything and the food was incredible.  I will definitely be back to try their weekend brunch of which I've heard amazing reviews."
"2.0","Disappointed. We were a group of five and everything seemed a bit unorganized. For example, only two of us got complete place settings and all of us had to wait ages for our waters to be refilled. There seemed to be an issue in the back of the house, as they ran out of clean glasses (they served us plastic cups), clean cups for soup (they had to serve us bowl sizes, but hey more soup for us), and also small plates (we got large plates for appetizers). It was actually kind of comical because every time something was brought out to us, it came with an apology. The food was unimpressive. I ordered the Portobello Grinder and it was a soggy mess. The fries tasted like they were sitting under a heat lamp for a while. On the bright side, my mom really enjoyed her salmon. No one else was singing praises, though."
"1.0","Ordered Gennaro's for the first time in about 6 months after the last time I had a hair in my pasta. Figured we would give it another try this time through. Ordered everything, driver calls when he gets to my house, and ends up being close to a block from my house. Had to walk well outside of my house to find this guy, as hes calling me back to ask me if I was even coming or not. After finding the driver, he hands me my food, which is an incomplete order.. Called back to a nice girl who apologized & had the rest sent out.. Went back inside to look to find my pizza was also made wrong. Easily never going back to here again after these 2 horrible experiences. Would not recommend at all. Plenty of other pizza shops in the SouthSide.."
"4.0","Stopped by for Cajun wings and beer after Bucs game.  The wings were crispy (requested style) and the flavor was OK.  The dry rub Cajun style needed to have more zing it I ate it all.  Spartan appointments."
"4.0","Very solid Thai food - better than most that I've had.  Service is okay, and the food is excellent.  I had curry, which was among the best I've ever had, and they've got one of my Thai favorites: green papaya salad.  (Someone please let me know if this isn't actually Thai.  I never had it when I was there, but I love it.  Even if General Tso's chicken isn't Chinese, I like it, too.)  Price is good, too.  With appetizers and two entrees, two people will get out of here for around $25.  The decor's a little odd: it's a converted lunch counter with some plants and Thai tchotchkies added in."
"5.0","Sausalido catered my fiance's Christmas party. There were many appetizers including crudite, sausage,  and shrimp. We also enjoyed the meat carving station, a pasta and risotto station, and several sides with different salads. Everything was warm and delicious. Excellent pick! I hope the company goes with them for their next event too."
"5.0","Blueberry hot cakes and lyonnaise potatoes give me life. This is a classic spot that everyone needs to check out! Prepare yourself to wait on the weekends...but it's worth every second."
"5.0","This is not a gourmet pizza joint but I crave this place so often. I started eating here at the nippers in Dormont. It reminds me of my favorite pizza shop back home. WOOP Johns!Anyway this is the best hangover food place in Pitt!. Lots, and tons of greasy melted cheese that dribbles over your big bites. I eat here like I'm in a food eating contest shoveling in huge mouthfuls of salty, doughy, cheesy goodness. The ham and pineapple pizza is pretty rad and I love the calzones too. It's so much cheese my heart is ready to stop with each bite. You would think that the 5 cheese calzone is what to get when going for the calzone but I have found that some of the different cheeses that are in it are an extreme salt overload. The meatball calzone or the ones I have gotten with filling then don't have enough cheese! The Goldilocks in me has me choosing the regular plain calzone it's juuust right!  The pastas are pizza shop pastas, greasy, thicker gummy noodles reminiscent of Chef Boyardee comfort! I like the spaghetti and meatballs. Going simple here is the way to go. The taco pizza is interesting but again it's not fine dining but everything I have tried has been sending me back for 5 years! So if you wake up in the morning with a yearning for a down the block Pizza GO to the Nippers. This is a take out place so no eating in, and they have a wide delivery range... they even come out all the way to the boonies of regent square. One of the very few that does!"
"5.0","Absolutely the best corned beef sandwich ever.  I have been a fan of Sammy's for at least 25 years.   It seems like nothing more than a bar, but don't let that fool you.  The corn beef is excellent.  I like the corn beef special on light rye with the coleslaw and Swiss cheese."
"5.0","Love this spot! Instantly transported toPortugal! Wonderful, authentic food and coffee. Such a gem in Pgh!"
"4.0","Great food, but you'll pay for it!  Not cheap...  Plus some of the servers aren't Japanese, geez."
"5.0","We were in Pitt under not so great circumstances but was able to get out for 2hours. BF & I came here based on the reviews & could not be more pleased. I wish I could remember our waiter's name, he was delightful. Made excellent recommendations & we had the following...Gindara appetizer - EXCELLENTThe chicken teriakyi sampler. Sorry my brain is fried & I cant remember the name of the dish. Came w/shrimp & veggie tempura...  and a couple rolls of sushi & a few pieces of sashimi - EXCELLENT4 sushi rolls... again, cant remember names sorry. The scallop roll, a roll w/eel & cucumber, rainbow roll & this odd sour plum & cucumber roll. Never seen it anywhere else so I had to try it. EXCELLeNTBest f-ing meal of my life or at least right up there... Waiter was super attentive. I admit i was a little worried because the place was almost empty on a Sat. night but it turned out to be exactly what we needed!!"
"5.0","$6 for a large cheese pizza is the best, day and night. The only downside in the Sorrento's/Antoon's debate is that Antoon's Ranch is a little off, but their pizza is amazing. Solid amount of cheese, and not terribly greasy."
"5.0","Very ethnic no taco bell here...the taste gave me a sensation of Mexico all i needed was a margarita or sangria mmm  so i bought a pure watermellon drink straight from the mellon....would recommend..."
"4.0","I'm a big fan of this place! I've had the chance to eat dinner here as well as eat off-menu light bites when organizations I'm a member of have booked lunch here. I've also had the chance to enjoy a quick tour of their wine stocks, which honestly are impressive in and of themselves! Not only did I get a glimpse into the huge collection of wine but I found out that they have quite a system here to ensure that different wines are ready for serving throughout the night. So yep, when it comes to wine it's safe to say that these guys definitely know what they're doing.Food wise, I can say after dining here during group outings that Capital Grille makes very delicious and tender meat dishes. I've had off-menu lamb bites and kabobs and can't even describe how tasty they were! The last time I was here for dinner I opted to stick to soup and salad, and believe it or not those options were just as satisfying as anything else I could have ordered. The bisque was thick and nicely seasoned, and the Caprese Salad was put together beautifully and drizzled with just the right amount of dressing - and hey, I love any place that doesn't drown its salads in dressing! And to finish my last meal off, I ordered the cheesecake with fresh seasonal berries. It was definitely one the best pieces of cheesecake that I've ever had, I think - it was both tasty and light and fluffy, so I left after eating feeling perfectly full rather than overstuffed from my delightful meal.Service? No complaints. I've never had a problem here. The waiters here are always able to answer questions and help with meal and drink selections when we're having trouble picking what to pair with what. They've also always been quick to check on our waters, take away empty dishes, see if we need anything else - honestly they've always succeeded in making me feel like a special guest, which in a place as fancy and expensive as Capital Grille is always a good thing, I think!I would absolutely come back for a big date or just to grab a drink and dessert, but unfortunately Capital Grille will always be a special occasion only sort of place. It's impossible to forget that the food here is expensive - particularly the steaks! - and while I don't mind paying for a high quality meal like the ones you can get here once in a while, those prices do mean that this place and my budget don't always mix well. Darn money, always ruining my fun!"
"5.0","Finally got a chance to stop by Arnold's Tea and was not disappointed. Arnold's tea is an incredible space for events or just a nice to get coffee. There are a couple of food items but this place mostly caters to the coffee/tea sippers.The staff is pretty friendly, and make good recommendations for the tea novices like myself. It's also usually pretty quiet so the ideal place to get work done. Great place, great atmosphere. A gem in the Northside. We need more places like this."
"3.0","We dined here for the first time after visiting the conservatory. We were excited since the food seemed fresh and they offer a good selection of sandwiches, salads, flatbreads, soups, etc. However, we were pretty unimpressed. The food was essentially flavorless. The flatbread was practically a tortilla with some cheese and peppers/onions on top. The sandwiches were rather small and really nothing special. The salad was flavorless, with little-no dressing. The basil parmesan soup, however, was good but the size of a cup was very small. The food did seem fresh but all in all, it was really nothing special."
"5.0","This place is so cute! I came here after walking by it several times. It is the perfect lunch spot - quick, delicious, and cheap! The turkey with bacon on the ciabatta was excellent! And the Sante Fe wrap is also great! It came with a side of soup (I got the chili and it hit the spot) and a drink for $9! I'll definitely be back!"
"5.0","Incredible hot chicken. Finally, a place that promises heat and actually delivers. Most places dial down their heat levels, which is why I think Chikn takes people by surprise. Medium is a solid heat level, obviously I would suggest starting there and going up to hot if you can handle it. The food always comes out so fast, in minutes, and is perfect temperature. It's never waiting under a heat lamp or anything like that. I moved away from pgh a few months ago and honestly I miss Chikn at least once a week. I can't wait to go back-- don't leave!!"
"5.0","After trying most Mexican restaurants & food trucks in town, Edgar's tacos are the most amazing tacos in Pittsburgh and are very authentic. I crave them on a regular basis.I've had the chorizo tacos multiple times. What I like about his chorizo tacos are they are delicious and flavorful, but not super greasy which is the case with most chorizo tacos. The shrimp in the tacos are small and fried, but equally delicious.I like how he has multiple salsas you can put on them.Even though I'm obsessed with his tacos the hibiscus tea was to die for. I could drink that every day. Soooooo good!The other great thing about Edgar is he is extremely friendly and his staff are as well. They are also very efficient.Like most taco stands in town, you either have to stand or take them with you. There is one small table inside, but that's it."
"5.0","Roethlisberger w/ bacon and pepper relish."
"3.0","Just okay. We came on a Wednesday around 5pm and only 2 other people there. Ordered the forest hills burger, fried chicken, Morningside, and full macaroni and cheese. I'm not a fan of Bleu cheese (included with the burger) so I asked for cheddar but was told it would be an up charge. Why do you charge more for cheese when you are replacing with another cheese? Food came out and fries were cold and macaroni wasn't cooked the whole way. Burgers were a little small but tasted good. Chicken was nice sized. We had a Groupon but don't think we'd come back without another one. $14 for each burger, too expensive for what you get. Can go elsewhere for cheaper and better burger and fries"
"5.0","This place is great.  We tried it because my friend saw duck on the menu.  We walked in on a Friday night with no reservations and they were able to accommodate us.  The service was a little slow, but it was great service.  The woman remembered everything we needed or asked for. I think she may have been the only server for all the tables.  There was some bus boy helper, but he didn't actually wait on the tables. I got the tortellini with chicken and arugula and it was spot on delicious.  They only complaint was that it may have been a little too greasy.  But that made it taste pretty good, of course.  There was so much I had to take 1/2 of it home.   My friend got the duck, he said it was cooked fantastic and very good, but didn't care for the apples that came with it.  That was just his preference. I don't think it was anything regarding the way the apples tasted or were cooked. My friend also got the homemade tomato and arugula soup.  It was very fresh and was a good mix of flavors.  We also got bread with white bean hummus and our side salads included with our meals.  Both were very tasty and excellent.  We finished it off with a ricotta berry dessert that came in chilled mason jar.  It was the perfect ending to a great meal.  The portion was big and it was not sweetened.  Fresh berries and ricotta mixed together were a great simple combination. Overall the experience was great and we will definitely be back.  You get great fresh food, big portions and good flavors.  Plus you are supporting a local restaurant."
"1.0","Went to the Bettis Grill today with the family. We actually started at the foundry.  we weren't too impressed with the menu, so we finished our drinks, and left. Should have stayed. I Hate to say this because I love the Bus, but it was by far the worst service I've had in over ten years. Waiter never brought us all of our drinks. In fact, after he took our order, he never came back. He literally passed our table no less than 12 times without stopping or coming near us. The poor people from the back brought our drinks and food. They looked swamped while the servers and hosts hung out.We finished our food, which was obviously sitting under a warmer for a decent period of time, and waited 15 minutes before stopping someone else to please have our waiter bring us a check. The wait staff was obviously more concerned about hanging out than doing their job. It was horrendous. It's a shame as I had such high hopes. I feel if Mr Bettis knew what was going on, he'd flip the entire floor staff."
"5.0","Had a great visit. The Alfredo with blackened chicken is awesome. Had George as our waiter. He was great. Showed us Jerome's man cave and gave great recommendations. Highly recommend the restaurant and George."

"5.0","Probably the best pizza place in town, and is definitely going to revolutionize the pizza industry. It's like subway/chipotle for pizza. I came here after seeing a review that said You get a $8 flatbread pizza with unlimited toppings and they were totally right, you get to completely customize your own flatbread including oils, sauces, dressings, and spices. Also don't forget to get 15% off with a student ID!"
"4.0","Really solid seafood spot. I got the halibut entree and ahi tuna appetizer, both of which were very good, and my wife's crab legs were super fresh. She also got the crab cakes as an appetizer, which we really liked as well. My mom also came and got the crab-stuffed salmon, which I didn't like quite as much as the others, but wasn't bad.Prices are a little bit high for Pittsburgh, but not terrible for seafood more generally."
"5.0","I've eaten Indian throughout the city for about 2 decades now.  This place is still one of the better places in terms of food quality.  Make sure to order their Peshwari naan!"
"3.0","I've only gotten take out here twice and I would have to say that the food is good but waaayyy over priced for what you get. The chicken tikki masala is great as well as the mutter paneer but the naan is soft and soggy! At my most recent trip to Pittsburgh, I got the mutter paneer, an order of garlic naan and rasmalai and spent over $20! Being that I am used to cheap (and good/tasty) indian food for half the price, I would have to say that I'd think twice to go back to Tamarind. Portions are small (two incredibly small rasmali for $5?!) and flavor is OK- I would say I rather go to Udipi for classic food or Indian Garden for cheap flavor. Not worth it in my opinion..."
"5.0","Great place.  Was craving something fresh and healthy, and this place popped up.  Wellll, alrighty then!  Had a green juice.  They pre-make them (but they aren't old), which is nice because you don't have to wait nine hours for a juice to appear and get in your belly.  Also had the lemongrass soup with vegan broth and tofu.  Had rice noodles and plenty of veggies.  Quite tasty and had a nice spice level.  Added some sriracha for extra oomph.  Was very filling, but calories were actually pretty low--like 500 for everything.  Price was maybe $14 for everything.  Not bad, you can go broke buying kale juice.  Would definitely return."
"4.0","We had not planned to have dinner there, but it was an on-the-spot choice and we did not regret it! Actually we enjoyed it.  The establishment is a nice small place, that gives you the (right) impression that people will take care of you.  The food was amazing.  The Gouda appetizer was a delicious choice and so was the hanger stake. Cooked to perfection.  I think it will become an often visit for me :)"
"3.0","Fast service but portions are pretty small!! Not extremely filling :/The waiters rush through orders and they are able to fulfill orders pretty quickly.The chicken was decent, with mild flavor."
"1.0","Service was absolutely brutal, there was one person giving obviously minimal portions to save money, and she attempted to over charge us. Just don't go here or sucks"
"1.0","Someone who I guess may be a manager kept the hostess staff and bartender away from customers.  Not sure if it was actually a manager. Wendell."
"3.0","I must confess that I have only been here once, but it was a memorable experience. This is because the service was so great, and the food was so...not.The servers were friendly, made recommendations, and were prompt with their service.There are some vegetarian options, which is always nice to see. At the time they had a special appetizer of arancini (fried balls of risotto). I love arancini, so of course I ordered them, but what came out was not at all what I was expecting. They were dry, floury cakes that seemed like they never were risotto. It was very unpleasant.I looked at their menu just now and feel like I could be persuaded to try again, so stay tuned."
"4.0","They don't get five stars because the music is so ridiculously loud that you can't hear anyone talking to you across a table.  You have to scream for anyone to hear you.  And considering this is not a club, they could stand to turn it down.  The place is small, but nicely appointed.  Could definitely use more space.  It was packed on a Wednesday night.  The bartender was very attentive and knowledgeable, and she definitely gave the experience a finesse that is lacking more often than not in 2017.  Cocktails were very interesting, and not at all expensive.  I was expecting an $80 check at the end of the night, and was thrilled when it came back at $51.  That was for four cocktails, a glass of prosecco, and an appetizer.  (Was there for a friend's birthday, and picked up two of her drinks, so really, had it been a regular day, I could go there, and have two drinks and food for $35ish...)I would recommend purely for the inexpensive well-prepared cocktails alone, but if service is like that every night, I don't think anyone will ever leave disappointed.  I'd like to see more food options on the menu.  Not every single thing has to be elevated and different.  Wings or just plain old fries would satisfy that.  And I know I'm old, but if you don't have TVs in the bar so you can promote conversation, turn the music down to a level where you can actually hear what other people are saying.  We did spend the night screaming 'WHAT?!' at each other."
"3.0","If you get past the cute atmosphere and fancy yet intriguing sounding menu, this place is just alright. When you get water they give you tiny water bottles, but I felt bad drinking more than 2. I got the fig jam and Brie French toast which tasted like nothing. I was expecting to taste the fig and could just taste mush. One piece of French toast is very filling. Parking can be tricky too here."
"5.0","Just awesome. The broccoli side dish was melt in your mouth. The pork soup dumplings were to die for. The lamb soup is excellent - even my kids eat it."
"5.0","Where to start... this place is a gem. I can't believe it's taken me so long to get here. I may even go as far as saying this is my favorite breakfast place in the city. Yes, parking isn't great. Keep circling the streets of Bloomfield until you find a spot. If you're lucky, one of the few spots out front will be open. You can sit outside at the counter window, inside or head straight to the back patio, which is exactly what we did. It was a super hot day, but the umbrella's give off the perfect amount of shade. The most important thing to know is it's BYOB! In addition to a mimosa I have to have a chai latte and here I had both! Don't be stressed when you look over the menu... you'll certainly be torn between the sweet and savory options. We did one of each! I'd do the exact same thing next time I go. They have so much to pick from you'll never need to repeat your order.If you've been putting off trying this place, don't. It's a must visit."
"3.0","It's good but some of the workers there are crazy. To the point that when I was eating one of them threatened the managers life. I watched her get fired. She said the place had bugs and she was going to have her boyfriend shoot the manager. I felt sick as I was eating. Having said that, it's good. Anything with just rice, you might as well go to chipotle or qdoba for the same effect (better effect at those other places). There Mediterranean bowl is BAE. I've been back several times for it."
"5.0","I'm new to town and was normally a chain pizza type of guy, but then scrolling through an ordering app I stumbled upon this semi humorously named pizza shop. Ill never look back. This place has changed my life in so many ways. As I continue to explore their elaborate menu, my senses are enticed with magnificent flavour profiles of so many items. Everything I get is cooked to perfection by a staff of hard working, kind individuals who are always sure to greet you as you walk in. Break away from your other pizza shops and take a little nip of the wide array of menu items crafted to satisfy my every culinary desire. I was asleep but now am awoken to an enlightened mans world of pizza, subs, steak fries, and wings from the prodigal pizza shop known as Little Nippers II."
"4.0","Hubby and I went here for dinner on a Saturday night.  RESERVATIONS = VERY IMPORTANT!The atmosphere of the restaurant is fairly casual, although I don't think I would wear jeans there.  Upon entering the restaurant, we were seated promptly and our drink orders were taken.  They gave us a few minutes before taking our order and we ordered the Smoked Brie, hubby had the Ravioli and I had the Risotto of the day.  They brought us a plate with fresh bread and a delicious white bean/oil/rosemary dip -- so good!  The appetizer arrived quickly and we went to work on the brie.  It was mild and creamy and delicious.  I would recommend asking for a little bit of balsamic reduction -- it added so much to the cheese!I didn't try the ravioli but my husband INHALED them.  He loved it!The risotto was amazing, probably the best I've had that I didn't make myself.  The day we went it was made with peas and crimini mushrooms.  Yum!We were stuffed after dinner but wanted to try the dessert so we got the bread pudding to go.  All I can say is more please! Another plus to this place is that it is BYOB, so you can bring whatever you like."
"5.0","Accessible, quality, and fresh are words that come to mind for Edgar tacos. I'm a fan because they meet my standards, offer vegetarian options that are substantial and delicious - i.e, they aren't just limp vegetables on a taco shell. I go for the soyrizo tacos always or refried black beans. I kept trying to show a friend who was in town how yummy these are, but we seemed to miss them every time! Ingredients are fresh and flavorful. I haven't had a bad experience yet, and it is all cheap and quick. It doesn't get better than this for 'fast' food tacos, plus it comes without the gastrointestinal disruptions later on, if you follow."
"1.0","Our waiter who's name was Chris was such a Ahole!! Whenever he decided to make an appearance at our table which didnt happen very often he was very rude and condescending. Most of the night we had to order drinks from other Waiters as they walked passed our table because Chris was out smoking butts. Also after we ordered 4+ bottles of average priced wine for the table he said 'you must be cheap and want a hangover'!! It was a $1,400 bill!! F him!! Definitely do not recommend this Capital grill"
"2.0","Went in later in the evening for a steak and a wedge salad. Drinks were great bartender was friendly. Steak was decent but not 'Ruth's Chris, Morton's, Capital Grille' worthy. My salad came out hot like they had put it in the warmer or I don't know what happened. I will definitely be sticking with Ruth's Chris as my high end steakhouse of Pittsburgh."
"5.0","Simply the best and most authentic tacos in Pittsburgh. Add friendly service and a smile and that's Edgars."
"5.0","As far as I am concerned, this is the best Thai food in Pittsburgh.  Inexpensive and good friendly service.  The family that owns this restaurant are really some of the nicest people you will ever meet.  More often than not, they will add a free desert or small treat to my take out order.  I love spice food, and when I ask for a level 8 of spiciness, I get level 8.  At most other Thai restaurants, I get a 4 no matter what I ask for.  If you like spicy food too, then I'm sure you will appreciate that.  If you dine there, I admit that the atmosphere is nothing to write home about.  I'd describe it as a hole in the wall, but in a good way.  Not fancy or pretentious by any means. Then again, at this price point, you really shouldn't expect too much."
"1.0","Friends and I have been coming here and all of the other former Sammy's locations for cheap beer and dry sandwiches, but I will never return. We already closed our tabs and was going to purchase a beer to go when some random man decided to make an unwarranted sexist comment to me about my appearance. It was insulting and uncalled for. I shared the remark with my friend that was coming out of the bathroom who defended me by telling the man to keep his comments to himself and that women don't need to hear what men think about them. The bartender, you know, the famous wrestler or whatever he is, told her to stop and eventually threw us out and 'banned us for life'. I guess it's okay to be insulted by men and women should sit there and silently accept it. As we were walking out the bartender just kept claiming that he 'won'. Congratulations on winning five less customers and a glowing yelp review, sexist asshole. I never thought I'd give a business a one star review, but you're welcome. You earned it."
"5.0","Wow, Umami really delivers on several levels. Umami is another fantastic addition to the Pittsburgh food scence in terms of Japanese goodness. The entrance was a bit hard to find as it is not well advertised, but it's located basically on top of Round Corner Cantina. The place is always packed and in summer time it's getting HOT in there, so be prepared! All the staff was amazing, friendly and very attentive. We had the Nagi Shigiyaki, which is a fried eggplant on ground chicken and it was amazing! We also had the pork gyoza, sushi and a couple of other items. I also had a cocktail to deal with the heat and to accompany my meals and it was delicious! Umami is a bit on the pricier side, but in my opinion well worth it."
"2.0","Had the worst $20 roasted chicken 'and black bean chili'. It was cold, bland, and just a huge bowl of basic chili I could have made at home. Thankful to the appetizer and the refillable bread."
"4.0","Great pastries and overall friendly staff! Loved the chocolate croissant. Giving it four stars because the vibe just wasn't there."
"5.0","The food is very good. Everything tastes freshly made to order. Exactly the kind of food that Penn Ave desperately needed in Bloomfield. Sometimes the wait is a little long, but only because they're freshly making all of the food, so the wait is worth it."
"4.0","Came in before a Pirate's game. It was extremely busy and also the hottest day of the year. We ended up at a standing table beside the bar. I thought we'd never get any service, but Nicole went out of her way to make sure we got drinks and food in time for the game. Thank you, Nicole! You're the best."
"4.0","First time in PA. It's so cool that it's snowing. I haven't seen snow since I was a young one. I flew in from California for a conference and I definitely wanted to try something different- so I decided, hey, let's order some Moroccan food. I placed my order, paid cash, tipped the driver, and so far I am pleased with the experience. The driver was very friendly and nice. I ordered quite a bit of things this evening including: Falafel salad, Falafel Morrito Burrito, Falafel Panini, and fries. I'm sampling everything right now and I'm so pleased with the food. Thanks Beta Bites for my first Moroccan food experience."
"1.0","I can't understand the good reviews this place has gotten.  This was our second trip- the first was just after they opened and we didn't love it but figured since it has been open for awhile the kinks would be worked out.  8 of us went for a birthday celebration the other night, so between us we tried most everything.  Throughout our meal there were major problems with execution.BYOB is nice, the white bean dip is ok but bland.  The various breads were generally good.  Everything was downhill from that point.  Apps: we had artichoke dip, stuffed zuchinni, and the gouda.  The gouda was fine, it was only room temp to slightly warmed but it's cheese and can't help but be tasty.  The zuchinni was notable only for not being bad.  The artichoke dip (2 orders, both this way) was just awful- it was more of an artichoke soup.  Chunks of oversalted artichokes floating (seriously- they were bobbing around like apples) in a thin, milky lukewarm broth with giant chunks of soggy unmelted cheese.  The center was cold- refrigerator cold.  We pointed this out to the manager, who didn't apologize or seem to note anything wrong, but offered to heat one up for us.  30 seconds in the microwave later it was steamy but the ingredients still weren't combined and it was still more soup than dip.  I think what is most bothersome isn't that there was clearly a prep error but that even after it was sent back, there was no quality control in the kitchen.A mushroom 'bisque' which appeared to contain no cream was watery, salty, and uninspired.Mains: our table tried the crab cakes, pumpkini ravioli, pork, London broil, and catfish.  Nothing stood out, and the pork was very dry and bland with an unappetizing combination of mushy sweet potato cubes and some unidentifiable grits-like topping.  Dessert: Creme brulee, which semed to go over well.  We also had the red velvet cheesecake, which was bad enough that 8 people sharing didn't finish even half of it.  It took awhile to put our finger on the problem, but as one astute companion pointed out it was salty.  Combined with a strangely dense and chewy texture, the overall effect was of a lurid pink playdoh served on topsoil.  I like for places to do well, and I try to give them a fair chance.  If the food had just been not to our liking or even just plain bad, I probably would have chalked it up to a bad night and not written a negative review.  What bothered me and prompted this entry was that we so clearly weren't happy with our meal and there was never a point where any staff recognized the problem, asked if anything was wrong (when 8 people eat and not a single person finishes a single dish and something is sent back, there is likely a problem), or offered to remove the completely uneaten artichoke dip-soups from our bill.  That tells me that there are either no standards or that no one cares.It seems that others have had a good experience here, but I would avoid it as the prices are too steep to be hit-or-miss."
"5.0","I hit up Cafe Raymond for Brunch on Saturday morning. Since I hasn't been before, I wasn't sure what to expect, but it has great reviews so I was excited to try it. I hadn't realized that you order your food and then get seated at a table. Luckily, I had looked up what I wanted to order, so I didn't have to hold up the line. The line was pretty long around 11:30am. But there were tables available and they had the patio open upstairs. I ordered an omelette- you can pick up to 3 add-ins for your omelette. The omelettes come with a side of potatoes. I added bacon, cheddar cheese, and mushrooms. The omelette was delicious! It was full of toppings and was a great size for the price. The potatoes were a little spicy, but with a little Heinz ketchup- they were great. I also split an order of lemon ricotta pancakes - they were wonderful. I definitely can understand why everyone likes them. They weren't the best pancakes I've ever had, but they were very good. I would definitely order them again or try the French toast next time. Overall, I loved my experience at Cafe Raymond and will be back again soon!"
"1.0","I've lived in Greenfield My entire life, me and my family have been getting food here for 25 or something years now, since they opened, when Domino's closed at that location and Rialto's opened up,the last five years or so this place has really gone down hill, so overpriced, even more expensive than mineo's or Aiello's in squirrel Hill which is so much better, Menu prices are always wrong, I got a menu inside the store know more than a week before I ordered today, and the price was several dollars more even before tax, Rialto's charges a expensive delivery fee, The main reason me and my family will never get food from here again, I ordered food for delivery today and they told me on the phone they no longer let you put a tip on your card you're using for food, which is very inconvenient because I do not keep cash, but was able to find a dollar to tip the guy with, I open the door and hand the delivery driver Tip before I sign for my card, He Waits for one minute or so for me to sign, then gives me the dollar back and tells me he does not want it because he came all this way for a dollar, I literally live two streets from Rialto's, The coward delivery driver waits to he is getting into his car to make smart comments to me, I am not a cheap person if they let me put it on my card I would of tipped him more, but one dollar to go two blocks on top of their delivery fee which is over three dollars and their prices always being way more expensive then says on their new menus, but you can thank your delivery driver for why me and my family will never be customers again after we supported your business since you opened, and ordered food there all the time"
"5.0","I love their Southern Philly cheese steak. It is delicious and enjoyable. Unlimeted refills on all coke products = AWESOME!!!"
"3.0","Not sure we need another burger joint, but this one is very good. Tessaro's is my gold standard for hamburgers, but they do okay here.The service was very prompt and the decor is very pleasant.For now this place is BYOB, bit it looks like they will add the craft beer very soon."
"3.0","I ordered my favorite Thai Basil Fried Rice and it was a disappointment. It was too hot (spicy) for a 3 and the rice was not fried completely; there were still globs of white rice coated with the seasoning."
"4.0","Short and sweet,this place is awesome.  Great food and atmosphere. Every time I come here, I get the Big Wheeler, or the number 7. Never left without saying 'wow, that was great'"
"5.0","More people need to go here the sandwiches are ridiculously good, the staff is awesome, and the prices are unbeatable! Stop sleeping Pittsburgh!"
"4.0","What a great restaurant inside the casino. My wife and I were doing some gambling and looked around for a place to have lunch. Came across this restaurant and was surprised how much the menu contained. Both of our meals were very good. I had a huge plate of nachos and she had a philly cheese steak with waffle fries/ huge pickle. Our waiter was quick and the restaurant was clean and had a view of the water. We will definitely eat here again. Didn't give 5 stars because the margarita machine was broken! So I didn't get to have one and I was in the mood for a frozen margarita with lunch lol."
"5.0","Drew was the most amazing server. Such great customer service and just an awesome guy all around. Totally made our experience."
"5.0","My favorite Thai place! Family run business, such good quality and authentic Thai food!"
"5.0","Great Pizza for $5. Let's be very clear, there are a bunch of 2 star reviews, that wanted gourmet pizza for $5 and were shocked to find out that extra cheese and pepperoni were extra. When evaluating a place you have to take the service in consideration to the price. If you want a better pizza, you can ask for extra cheese, pepperoni, garlic crust, etc. and still walk out with a large pizza for roughly $7.50, which is well under the $10-$15 you would spend at a major chain. I also regularly get their cheese sticks and cheese steak hoagie."
"2.0","I used to be a HUGE fan of this spot because of the feel of the venue and their food. Specifically their beef jerky. Friends of mine used to come from Morgantown to order so much beef jerky and now it's off the menu. I am so freakin sad about them removing this from them menu. I think we'll be considering other locations downtown to get drinks from now on"
"5.0","Ok I'm really mad that I haven't come here sooner! Delicious, quick, and cheap--tacos done right!! Came here on a whim on a Monday night and even then it was pretty packed (granted this place is about the size of my thumb). This place is basically a taco truck but inside a small building. The menu is simple, a few types of tacos, some nacho options, and bottled drinks. I love that you have the option of flour or corn tortillas. The chicken taco has an amazing smoky flavor. Oh, and not only are the delicious, they are cheap!! $3 a taco. Can't beat that. Love the interior decor and I'm a sucker for neon signs lol"
"5.0","This is an awesome new place in Oakland! The chicken is delicious and the portions are generous at an extremely fair rate! The service was very quick, I would highly recommend trying this place out for lunch or dinner! Be careful though, even the mildest chicken has a bit of a kick to it."
"5.0","THIS PLACE.If you're down on Penn, do yourself a favor and swing by Peppi's. When I'm downtown, this is my SPOT. Number one, this place is great for everyone's price range. It's affordable, consistent and always SO GOOD. The Joey Porter-bella is hands down my go to, you're lookin' at a life long Steelers fan right here! I tried that Cathedral sub the other day and that sandwich is a DREAM. I was thinking about the Forbes Field Burger with some of Peppi's fresh cut fries ALL DAY yesterday at work. I'll be down there this weekend, gonna add some extra banana peppers too :)The staff is cool as hell, always friendly and helpful. They always go above and beyond. A very special thanks to everyone here!"
"4.0","Get place a few co workers and I went for dinner one night everything was great until the server made a smart comment. Then went back Monday and had the same server and she apologized and was a lot better. Food always great."
"5.0","I went to this place earlier this week and loved it. The atmosphere, decor and food reminded me of the pubs (Izakaya) I went to when I studied abroad in Japan. It's the most authentic Japanese place I've been to in Pittsburgh."
"5.0","This place is pretty special. With so much of Bloomfield becoming very expensive and unattainable for folks who aren't willing to pay $20 a person for brunch, this is a very special neighborhood offering that feels like it is catering to the actual community of Bloomfield rather than just the high earners. Just as importantly, the food here is a treat. In addition to the vegan chili, I ordered a sweet potato waffle with avocado and a soft egg, the special of the day. It was hearty, tasty, and completely vegetarian. The coffee is great. The chefs really care about ingredients. Everything we tried was great. I highly recommend it, and we will be back soon."
"5.0","ugh i love this place. ive been here enough times to know who gives huge portions and who doesnt. either way, the food melts in your mouth and is soooo cheap.i love the grilled chicken, saag paneer, lamb curry, chili chicken, and baked chicken (sundays only i think). PRO TIP: a whole box lasts at least two lunches. get a 'small box' to get rice and one item for $4.95!"
"3.0","Really solid place! I can't eat bread so I just ate the meat which was really good :) I liked it and will be back. My only complaint was slow service."
"5.0","This is my fav thai restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Compared to what I have tried so far, They have the most authentic thai food here, even better than the Thai Cuisine next door. I like most of their dishes (curries, noodles, soup), didn't try many appetizers though. Love all sorts of spicy noodles there! Pad thai is the best! Duck curry is also yummy. Be cautious, don't try 7 or above, because it can be really HOT!"
"4.0","Pizza was good. I liked everything about it. We got the Hawaiian Pie. Garlic jumbo wings were cooked right and big and meaty but not really garlicky. Just a kind of butter sauce that was kind of bland. Still a decent pick though, just wish I'd picked a different sauce. The steak quesadilla we ordered was AMAZING. Highly recommend it. Thin sliced steak, almost like lamb with a delicious sauce, cheesy, and awesome tortilla. Delivery was right on time as promised 40-45 mins and up to the hotel room no problems. Pleasant service on phone and by delivery man. Ok pricing for what you get. No napkins, spices or cutlery included but I didn't ask for it. Slightly disappointed in that, but overall we were happy."
"4.0","Mmmm, Italian Village!  I'd been to a few locations before, but yesterday was the first time I'd been to the one Downtown.  I went shopping at Macy's on my lunch hour and the pizza cravings just overcame me.  Italian Village has single slices and I got mine with ham, broccoli, and spinach.  See Mom?  I'm eating my veggies!  Pizza's the perfect food 'cos you get your bread, meats, veggies & dairy all in one slice.  I should've gotten mime with pineapple in order to take care of the fruits.  Who could ask for anything more?And in a shout-out to my Chicago Yelp friend Melanie S., there's nothing better than cold pizza the second day.  I bought a second slice--pepperoni & mushrooms--to enjoy today.  It was a picture perfect day so I dined al fresco in a nearby plaza."
"4.0","Loved it. Cute little bar on Mount Washington. Great food, amazing Moscow Mule - must try!"
"5.0","Easy stuff first - decor is really cool.  Yes, the fish on the wall are real.  The paintings are awesome.  Yes, that's Luke's dad on a lobster phone (though experiencing the real deal in person is even more interesting).  The sushi there is excellent.  The individual pieces may be slightly smaller than the Slippery Mermaid's, but the quality is second to none.  The fish is fresh, tasty, and high quality - and for a very reasonable price.  Lobster bisque fries are similar to gravy fries but with lobster chunks, and if you splurge the extra dollar (and why wouldn't you), bacon bits.  Catfish bites are excellent - and ask for sriracha to add to the dipping sauce to make it the way they originally came when he first opened.  Definitely awesome & spicy.  Mahi Mahi tacos are another excellent appetizer.  As for the cocktails - good gravy in the navy!  The ginger mule is excellent.  So is the Snozzberry.  That said - the Bloody Mary is hands down the best drink available here - and possibly the best Bloody Mary I've had in Pittsburgh.  Spend the $3 and add the candied bacon.  It's absolutely, positively worth it.  You have to have this Bloody Mary.  That's all there is to it.  If for no other reason, go there and have this Bloody Mary.  Seriously."
"4.0","Neat atmosphere, interesting menu, good bites. I usually get the Udon noodles because a I'm not big on ramen. The udon noodles are tasty and the serving is large.Another tasty bite is the pork belly robota. Super delicious, but, like most robota, not a lot of food. Get two! It's worth it."
"5.0","I love it so so so so much, thanks to my wonderful bf I have now been to Kiku for more than 5 times and this place never failed me! Please try their sukiyaki and shabu shabu (a Japanese style hot pot) in which you put beef, veggies and udon noodles. They offer a raw egg as the sauce, even being from China I found that very new, surprising and I did accept eating it with a raw egg!!! In addition to the raw egg they also offer another two types of sauces and a pot of soup base in case we ran out of soup or warm water in the pot. Sukiyaki is slightly salty with a rich soup base, and it has bamboo shoots, rice noodle, onions in it. Both 'hot pots' are perfect! Also tried their tempuras some other times, loved how they fried veggies, shrimp and chicken. The first time I went there I also tried the matcha cheesecake it is really special too! This restaurant is really authentic. I do hope they add pictures on their menu though as a lot of the times we do not know what the menu says... But anyways, I am so looking forward to going back to Kiku for another feast."
"3.0","I was really really excited to try this place since before they're opened. I was sort of disappointed. This place is more like a 3.5 stars for me, I decided to give them a 3 because we made a reservation but still wasn't able to sit at a table. They asked us to wait another twenty mins for the table, so we decided to sit at the bar. The food I've tried is delicious but nothing was the best I've ever had. The okonomiyaki and bacon quail egg were yummy, the matcha sponge cake dessert is also very good! Other things I've tried, takoyaki, miso Raman, Chicken skin and chicken thigh are just average. I will have to give this place another try, and update my review. For now, I'm not super excited about it!"
"5.0","Hidden gem.  Incredible Chinese Food!  The group of people I ate with had a wide variety of dishes, everything was delicious.  I would recommend the crispy beef or any of the lo mein combination platters.  Also some of the best tea I ever had.  2 thumbs up!"
"5.0","Moving to Pittsburgh from L.A. I was skeptical as to where I would be able to find a taco stand. A coworker suggested we stop by Edgar for lunch. Edgar went beyond expectations. Fresh ingredients and made right in front of you. Bonus points for the salsa bar. Only $5 for two tacos. I look forward to becoming a Edgar regular!"
"5.0","Had an amazing 30th wedding anniversary dinner.  Attention to detail, going the extra mile etc. Food was outstanding. People bitching about the prices...shut it...it's an expensive restaurant.  You want cheap, head down to Eat N Puke.  This is a great place to celebrate very special occasions."
"4.0","Oakland was seriously lacking a good chicken joint. I was hoping for a chick fil a, but this was DELICIOUS!! I was there opening weekend so it was crowded and there was very little seating for the amount of people there. We sat by the window and everytime someone walked in the 6 degree air would blow on us. The southern style chicken tenders were delicious as well as their fries. My boyfriend got a hot chicken sandwich and, WARNING, it's VERY hot. If you like hot things, try medium first so you don't get bad heart burn later."
"4.0","Authentic tacos at an excellent price point. They have an appealing menu and great service. The chicken included avocado, farmer's cheese, cilantro and lime. Delicious.The taco shells are soft, with a choice of flour or corn.  I highly recommend the corn."
"4.0","The food tastes great. The portions are more than ample. The staff is friendly. What a nice surprise for basically an impulse visit. Our friends at the Pittsburgh Winery made the recommendation. We are glad we listened."
"4.0","After coming back multiple times, I really hope that they have the option of unsweetened tea. I mean people can add packaged sugar or sweetener as much as they want. The current version is way too sweet... Hands down the best chicken I had in the States.Price is a little bit high(11$ for a meal with sandwich/side/drink) but about the same level as Stack'd.(I think they have the same owner). Chicken is good, mild is about the same spicy level as the popeyes spicy, medium is already 'I can't stop drinking' kind of spicy."
"2.0","OK Pizza (think Little Caesars) and horrible service. My wife ordered a half vegetarian and half pepperoni pizza. I went to pick it up and it was $20. When I asked why he said that vegetarian was a premium topping so it was $20 instead of $12. I brought up that it was only on half of the pizza so I shouldn't be charged the full amount. he said 'Look, we don't do half premium pizzas but it was a new guy that answered the phone so we did it. We did you a favor.' He was the manager and wouldn't budge on the price. We had company over so I just paid it."
"5.0","This little Italian shop is absolutely adorable. I usually stop in every year during Little Italy Days, but I am planning on visiting much more often. They have a ton of beautiful, unique gifts including dolls, plates, decorations, cooking gadgets, etc. It is incredibly homey & cozy in the store- it feels like you are at your grandmother's house. The coolest part about this shop? There's a complete kitchen in the back! The smell of fresh pizzelles and biscotti overwhelms your senses when you walk in the door. I have tried their cannoli, and pizzelles and love them both. I need to try their biscotti next! They also have a freezer with homemade soups, meatballs, sauce, etc. The employees are so genuine and helpful and last time I visited they informed me they offer cooking classes- which I am really interested in checking out!"
"5.0","Went to Wheelhouse on a Sunday night with my husband. Service was great (Eric) and food was great. I got the wheelhouse burger with BBQ  pork and pickles and it was very good. My husband got a bleu cheese burger and that was also good. Both came with a side of fries, but it was a nice surprise that the fries are a mixture of steak fries, curly fries and waffle fries. Who likes choosing between kinds of fries when you can have them all? I ordered a cup of chili with a side of cornbread. It came with a large dollup of sour cream that I had to scoop out (way too much) but the chili and cornbread were very good. My husband got the soup du jour which was a creamy potato something and that was also delicious. We were able to watch the SNF game and enjoy a few beers (16oz coors light for $3) and then go out and do a little gambling. This place is a great value and has very good food!"
"5.0","Sometimes micro breweries try too hard and make terrible beer in the process, this place is not the case at all! When I first went I was greeted with a beautiful decor and a fun atmosphere. Since they are a newer joint they only had 4 or 5 of their homemade beers on tap. I figured since it was the weekend I was gladly enjoy one of each! Not one of them was bad. Really loved the stout! Now they just aren't a beer joint, the food was awesome! A fancy menu with some interesting things! I tried the burger and LOVED it! The fries were something else too. Highly recommend checking this new place out! Looking forward to trying more of their beer!"
"4.0","We recently had an event here so I was glad for the opportunity to return to have dinner with family and friends. The fall menu is now out so the offerings I had at the event are no longer available. They are now serving turkey with all the trimmings.Service is always fast and the staff are the nicest ones to work with. This one has also been remodeled to include a take out window. The usual menu items are available as well as their renown soup and salad bar. My turkey dinner came with stuffing, gravy, and a side of my choice. It was very good. Pumpkin pie and cake is now in season so make the most of it while you have the opportunity. A person in our group had the rosemary chicken which is another one of my favorites and it did not disappoint. This Eat n Park has the new check service. You don't have to take your check to the pay area. Prices are very reasonable and you can get a good meal or sandwich or whatever you are interested in. They do change the daily soup menu but they always have chili and chicken noodle soup on the salad bar. It's right off an exit at Banksville Road headed away from the city.Definitely the place for smiles!"
"4.0","Completely stuffed and I'm not even 1/3 into my Pad Thai takeout.  They even packed a surprise dessert (sweet green bean soup)!"
"5.0","Jerome Bettis' Grille is my boyfriend and I's (almost) weekly spot. We go here one a week, every chance we get.  Not only is the atmosphere relaxing and welcoming, the staff is also friendly and helpful. One personal reason that I enjoy coming is due to the extensive gluten free menu. I have a severe gluten allergy, so finding a place to eat out that is accommodating is a rarity. The grille has a separate kitchen for gluten free items, and they always come out on circular plates. My personal favorites include the nachos, buffalo wings, and grilled chicken burger, which comes with fries!Out of all of the times that we have eaten here (too many to count) I have never gotten sick. I love this place and would recommend to anyone! We have had many waiters, since we come here often, but George is by far the best. He is knowledgeable, friendly, prompt, and helpful. He informed us about the gluten free kitchen and plates, checked up on us often, and ensured that we had our food/drinks as soon as available to him. Thank you for another great experience!"
"5.0","My absolute favorite Thai place I've ever been thus far!!! One of the best Thai food! Great quality, great price, and great portions! For lunch they even give out free wontoon soup and egg roll. The sever is always friendly and offers extra rice for no extra charge.Caution: The spicy level 10 is very hot! Its finally an Asian place where their spicy rating system is accurate. Would recommend and go anytime I'm back in Pittsburgh. MUST TRY"
"5.0","When the new owners took over a few months back I wasn't sure what to expect.It's the perfect little city bodega. Lots of staple, pantry grocery items as well as beverages, deli selections and more.You can have a custom made sandwich for around $6-$7 and I get one now and again. My office is at Butler and 53rd so this market is a great lunch option for me.I'm really happy this place still exists and is actually better than what it once was."
"4.0","Great place. Nice good menu. Large bar with lot of TV. Good location. We had one of the flatbreads to split and just enough we wanted. Small meal before Braves game.  Large selection on drafts with some bottles. Staff (Trent behind bar) was very attentive.  I would come back. It is not a national chain and has some local flavor."
"2.0","Atmosphere- The lights were so red and any attempt of taking picture without flash light gives redness. Food- the squid slices were excellent. But that's it. Other menu are over-priced for the quantity AND quality. Especially donburi wasn't really worth it. It was only full of tofu and vegetables (if I remember correctly, it isn't a vegan menu, however.) Chirasi- you get what you pay for. As a Japanese food lover, I wouldn't really recommend it."
"5.0","The best- no, the ONLY place to get tacos in Pittsburgh. I always leave with a full belly and looking forward to the next visit. My favorite taco is hands down the chicken- it's just sooo darn good. Juicy chicken, refreshing creama and avocado, mmmm. I also love the pulled pork taco and usually find myself going for their daily special. Today it was Korean bbq chicken- it was what I can only describe as transcendent. The loaded nachos are always a hit and super filling. I tried a Dino bowl for the first time today- courtesy of the owner. It was super filling and delicious. A great and healthy option that makes you forget you're getting a huge helping of veggies and protein. The hospitality on top of the delicious food simply can't be beat. Any time I'm drinking in or near the south side, I think I look forward to the late night tacos more than the drinks. I also love Doce because I never feel guilty about stuffing myself full- the ingredients are truly so fresh and good for you that even those who 'watch what they eat' can feel good about a meal here. If you haven't tried this place yet, you're seriously missing out!"
"5.0","The Roethlisburger sandwich is beyond delicious if you like Pittsburgh style sandwiches with more than enough toppings and sauces like I do!I always go to the Strip District location. The staff there is young and more than friendly. I always enjoy a place with self-serve drink fountains since I am one of those people who usually pisses off a waitress since I'm in need of refill after refill during my feast!You can read more about Peppi's on my blog at http://midnightguru.com/place.php?id=277"
"3.0","Food is good, but not worth the wait it takes to get it. Very slow though, took 45 minutes to get a chicken philly. Was told 'you gotta give us time to cook the chicken to the right temp.' Wasn't aware it that takes that long to cook chicken. And it wasn't busy either, only a handful of people in the store."
"4.0","Visited for the first time on a Tuesday night using a Groupon. There was no wait, though they do take reservations. Great happy hour prices and the burgers were definitely worth it given the local sourcing, and the Groupon. We tried the Polish Hill burger and the Fox Chapel burger - both were delicious. Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the burger patties were kind of slim compared to other places where you pay $13 for a burger. Happy hour specials can be found in the attached  photo."
"1.0","I had lunch buffet which is about $10. There were some food to get but they don't have distinguishing tastes. For example, in my picture, can you tell that I get a little bit of everything from the buffet? Moreover, they tasted the same....I don't recall it tasty or worthy at all. When you pay upfront in the desk, they use a iPad thing to process the payment and they literally stare at you and your movement when you make to the 'tip' section. It really feels uncomfortable and somewhat 'forcing you to pick the high tip' even though it is a buffet and I barely got any service."
"3.0","This is an old school burger shop. I'm talking old school. Now I don't know the history of the place, but judging by the atmosphere I'd say they've been around awhile. (See pics). This restaurant was Smart, took advantage of the local teams rejuvenated franchise led by a guy with the last name Roethlisberger. They made a huge hamburger, named it The Rothlisburger aka Rookie of the year. Made with sausage and burger on a hoagie bun.  The NFL sat Chris Berman and Big Ben down and filmed them eating this massive Burger....... I witnessed this and told myself I would eat one of these things one day...... 15 years later, I got the chance.  I pride myself on my burger reviews.  I eat ALOT of them.... I love them. So naturally since I was in town, I tracked the iconic burger down. It was not nearly as big as I expected. But it was delicious.  I finished it and instantly wished I had ordered fries too.  I walked about a mile to get to this location.... Found out there are 3 shops in the Pittsburgh area and that I was not at the original.  Service was great.  I'll be doing my research if I return, I wanted to go to the original birth place of this burger."
"5.0","My friends and I go out often to very nice restaurants around the city, and this is one of our favorites!  The dishes are exquisitely prepared, the food is very fresh and flavorful, menus selections are innovative.  We also receive wonderful service and attention from the staff, and the chef always comes out to check on us after the dishes are served;  last time we were there we said we were too full to order desert and were then presented with a large complimentary plate of fresh strawberries for desert!  It is BYOB- so bring some nice bottles of wine to accompany your meal.   A wonderful find!"
"5.0","In the urban dystopia known as the Strip District are many fantastic eateries - this is one. Get a window seat for sick people watching. Try an award winning Bloody Mary. We did. Several of them. Signature dish is the Steel City Lobster Roll. Comes with a mountain of fries. I nixed the fries for a salad ($2 bump up) with amazing ginger dressing. Also had a broiled cod sandwich - enough for two. This place is sure to induce a food coma afterwards, and is guaranteed to make even the strongest person give up their keto diet for a day."
"3.0","The pizza here is slightly better than average,  but the subs and salads are the best in this section of the city. The steak salad is pretty good.  Lots of fresh greens, tomatoes and a big pile of fresh pizza mozzarella.   Their homemade ranch dressing tops it off well.   This is a negative for me,  but the steak is more of a jiffy steak.   Some folks love it,  but I prefer a real steak,  rare. The subs and burgers definitely beat my expectations for a corner pizza joint.  The burgers are large and definitely a good quality,  if not handmade.  The Buffalo chicken sandwich is AWESOME, with their yummy Buffalo 'fries'  on top.   I get it with their ranch on top. I wouldn't go out of my way to get there,  but definitely worth a try if you work downtown."
"1.0","Treated rudely by hostess...worried about where we sat....told us had to sit where sat because of house rules...the place is empty and she is dictating rude....owner was also rude.  Don't go here....other staff very helpful but afraid of owner.  Long story but used profanity telling us that had to do what he dictated because we were 'shit.'  Took our money elsewhere.  You should too."
"4.0","This is a solid, Italian restaurant.  Make no mistake, this place isn't for the snooty diners who are looking for fancy innovative Italian dishes.  It's not a hipster-chic spot in Lawrenceville, it's in Old Little Italy Bloomfield.  This place is like going to your Italian grandmother's house for dinner.  And while the decor can seem a bit out dated, it's a great atmosphere with a homey feel.Pros:The food here is great.  Everything we've had we've enjoyed.The place has an old wooden bar that is vey charmingThe bartenders are super nice and attentiveThe prices are very reasonableThe owners can often be seen in the dining room talking to and thanking guestsCons:The decor could be updated a bit, but the place has been around for a very long timeThe parking is like every other place in Bloomfield, street parkingOverall, this is a staple Italian place that you can get a reasonably priced meal in a relaxed atmosphere, with little to no fuss."
"5.0","So happy I looked at yelp when I checked in to the hotel in Shadyside.  Pamela's hotcakes deserve all accolades - they rank in the top 3 in my book.  I tried the banana walnut crepe pancakes - fresh bananas, walnuts, and whipped cream in a delicate tasty pancake - if you like banana bread - you will probably like this - maple syrup wasn't needed but I used some anyway - it is better than delicious.  The eggs and sausage were good too.  I came for a late lunch during the week and did not have to wait.  Service was efficient.  I enjoyed the ambience of the diner and Walnut street - so much fun to hang out here."
"4.0","Had the chicken and broccoli. It was very good. Large pieces of white meat chicken, crisp broccoli and a delicate sauce. I think I have tried them all in the tri-state and this is one of my favorites. My husband had the garlic vegetables. It was slightly bland but some people probably like a mild garlic taste instead of overpowering. It also had fresh, crisp vegetables.I started with a chicken egg roll that just about filled me up. My son had a crab rangoon appetizer but it was a bit cold. We were the only table so that was odd. The taste was fine but we like them really warm.The tea was nice. Many restaurants do not give complimentary tea anymore. When the waitress brought it out, it made our dining experience so much better. I know it's not much, but I think it is such a great compliment to dinner.Pleasant staff and clean inside. Overall, I would love to come back."
"5.0","Awesome brewpub. Grabbed some beers here while walking along Butler Street. They have some quality, craft options. They have a nice variety of beers without an overwhelming selection. I've tried some of Cinderlands' offerings around town and I've liked all their beers so far. The brewpub has a couple TVs above the bar. There was an open storefront which was cool feature for a nice day. They also have some dining space on the second floor which was being used for a private event."
"3.0","We had unreasonably slow service that even though I did enjoy my meal, I felt the restaurant deserved a sub-par review. I went with the large group and we surprisingly didn't have to wait for a table on a weekend afternoon. Really like how they have huge circle tables for large groups. However, it took us three hours to finish the meal. Every part of the meal was slow - taking our orders, checks, etc. Our waitress forgot to put in our order, but was nice about it and gave us a free round of drinks. Anyways, I ordered a Blood Mary to start, its highlight is that it's served with two plump shrimp! For my main, I ordered the crab cake sandwich and loved it. Perfect ratio of ingredients, with more crab flavor than breadcrumbs/filling. I'm a HUGE seafood fan, so the food and ambiance are worth a return trip, but I'll be wary if I have time constraints."
"4.0","Cool place with cocktails just like I like. I took the one with 'Outdoors' in it - a herbal whisky something that came served with a big sprig of rosemary - yum! And the Bone Marrow dish was amazing. I've never seen that on a menu before, so I was like a moth to a flame with that one. Go here :)"
"5.0","One of the best Thai restaurants I have ever been. I have been going here for over 10 years and the food has always been great. If you like authentic Thai cooking, this is the place for you!"
"5.0","Stopped by with my husband on a Saturday for an early lunch. The owner made a point to come over to greet us as we sat at the bar overlooking the food prep area. The drinks were great-I had the daiquiri on the recommendation of our waitress (really good!) and my husband had the Old Man Joe which was one of the best old fashioned cocktails I've ever had. The menu was so interesting that we over ordered because we wanted to try so many of the items. I'm not sorry that we did. For the Apps we ordered Marcona Almonds (soft lavender/tarragon flavors with garlic & sea salt), Buffalo Chicken Rillettes (these were amazing served with beer bread & rich blue cheese but the richness was cut with the crunchy, zesty pickled celery)-delicious!! We also shared the Pierogi (the filling was carmelized cipollini onions& Gouda), the Soft Shell Crab sandwich and the Scotch Egg. Everything was seasoned perfectly and almost everything was put together in front of us. The chef spent time talking to us and it was fascinating watching him work. I don't usually drink beer but we were offered a sample and it was really nice-it had a heavy citrus flavor and I wish I could remember the name of that one because I would order it again. Don't miss this place-the food, drinks & atmosphere are fantastic!"
"3.0","Disappointing evening.The Capital Grille has always been our go-to place for special events and whenever we can escape from the kids.Last night was a special night for us and a couple that we went with.Food was on point, no complaints. Steaks perfect, salads perfect, sides perfect.Where they fell short was in the wait staff.    Usually we get the same waitress, or someone we know like Margie, we should have asked for her, our bad.   We got someone else this time, I will not publicly say who it was , we aired our grievances last night with the manager and I hope they do something about it, like additional training.This in no way will deter us from not coming back, however we will consider one of the other 4 steak joints in Pittsburgh first.  Hyde Park, Ruth Chris, Eddie Merlot, Mortons."
"4.0","My boyfriend and I started out our Saturday night by visiting Cinderlands Beer. We reserved a table on opentable and were immediately seated upon arrival. I tried one of their sour beers and my boyfriend had a hoppy beer. Both beers were good but not exceptional. For our meals I had the spicy chicken sandwich and he had the diner burger. The chicken sandwich was very tasty and the diner burger was also good! The prices were a little high for my taste here, but it's always nice to have beers you might not be able to get at other restaurants."
"2.0","Not impressed.  Food was okay - didn't care for the potato skins with bbq sauce....just a strange combination.   Service was not good and the bartenders were the rudest I have ever experienced.  I won't ever go back here."
"5.0","Thank you to Yelp for helping me find this place while visiting for the weekend to watch a Phillies, Pirates Game back in April. Such a cool little place, I wish I could visit more often. Cafeteria style food on one side and an awesome market on the other side where you can watch them butcher your meat right in front of you. They have a fairly extensive collection of middle eastern food products.The food was fabulous. My wife and I had shawarma's and they were up there with the best I've ever had, and soo filling. They were great for a day of sighseeing. I always kinda worry that the staff in this type of place can be kinda indifferent and/or just make you feel awkward but these guys were super friendly. Also, they had these Lebanese non alcoholic malted fruit beverages called 'Laziza' which were amazing! Its basically like a soda but not as sweet. I can't find them anywhere here in the Philadelphia and am definitely gonna get a couple cases next time I'm in town. Even if you're not looking to buy any goods from the market you should pop in and take a look... unless you're squeemish about seeing full animals with no skin. Lots of fun stuff over there. I can't wait to come back"
"1.0","Ten ounce filet was only about 8 ounces. Medium well steak was well done not medium well.  Bernese sauce had no flavor. Longhorn steak is better than a $200 dinner for 2. The mushrooms were very over cooked.  The cream bulee was weak with no temperature gradient and poor custard flavor.  We were quite disappointedThe service was excellent. Food disappointing and expensive"
"5.0","I have always enjoyed coming to Capital grilleWith my family. The staff are friendly and always welcoming. The food is good as it always is when I come in to eat. I'd probably rate this higher if I could."
"5.0","I've been searching for this sandwich for 11 years!!!!I ate here when I was visiting colleges in high school. It was AMAZING. I did find a school to play ball at right outside of Pittsburgh but I couldn't find/ figure out what restaurant had the sandwich called 'The Roethlisburger' -- I went all through college wishing I could had found this place. After college I would come back and visit and think 'man I wish I could find one of those sandwiches again'... well, 11 years later/ today I FOUND IT!!!11 years was worth the wait!!!  It was as savory and mouth watering as the first time I had this amazing sandwich. Hands down best sandwich in Pittsburgh. Hands down best sandwich I've ever had in my life. 10/10 - 100/100."
"5.0","LOVE LOVE LOVE. Yes, it deserves the capital letters. Come here for tacos. Practice your Spanish with Edgar. Enjoy taco heaven. There are no other words to describe it. Oh. They are cash only (no ATM). And you order inside before handing the slip to the people who make the tacos outside. And then it's a short wait until the taco gods shower you with yumminess."
"5.0","This review is for our awesome server - Gabriel !He has such a fabulous personality, goes above & beyond for his guests and is a great local tour guide. While our food wasn't fabulous- Gabe more than made up for those deficiencies!! If you go here , it will be worth your effort to ensure he is your server!! Best personality ever!"
"5.0","Kiku sushi definitely hit the spot after a long day. I was able to get in soon before closing. The sushi bar was already closed so I grabbed a table near by. Started with a large bottle of Kirin Ichiban. Seemed like a bargain for $7. From there, I got the deluxe platter, which consisted of miso soup, a few rolls and several pieces of basic sushi...tuna, salmon, shrimp, a whitefish (yellowtail?), and a few others. Knowing I was hungry, I also ordered the Steelers roll (in Pittsburgh after all). A roll topped with eel and avocado. Everything was authentic and delicious. I wish Kiku was closer to where I lived because I'd eat here often."
"2.0","Came here last night with a friend who talked wonders about this place. In all honesty- sure, we were one of the last people there, but damn, that lack of customer service! We order our tacos on corn tortillas, because that's how the Lord intended tacos to be. Well, guess which ones we received? Not only the disgrace of actually receiving a flour tortilla, but their bathroom was 'unavailable'? At least have some hand sanitizer at hand if your spot, which serves TACOS, which you happen to eat with YOUR HANDS, has a 'busted bathroom'. Also, be kind enough to at least saying when your bathroom is down where to find an alternative.Tacos were meh (but this is me comparing to tacos from out of town) and their selection of hot sauces mediocre. Felt like I was in a Chipotle.Two stars are for decoration.Obviously now him and I are not friends any longer. Whoever brings you here for tacos doesn't appreciate you and you shouldn't have them in your life."
"4.0","In a trendy neighborhood we felt like this boutique sized eatery was definitely part of the scene. Packed with thirty something crowd, noisy and fun, we were in the upstairs loft with a group of six. The drink menu is limited but good. I had the IPA (beer) which was good. Others had bottled cokes, wine and beer. The food is also a pretty short menu but covers all the bases I had the crab sandwich which was good. Maybe switch to a different bread if you get it. Others had turkey which was probably very delicious, and a couple had pulled pork which also seemed yummy. We made a reservation since it was Saturday night and we had a big group. Otherwise seating looks more like two tops and a bar."
"5.0","We went there on a game weekend. The wait wasn't too long. The food was amazing and the shots were good, try the Pancake shot! You won't be disappointed. Our waiter was George and he was by far the best EVER!!!!"
"5.0","'All star brunch/lunch place with amazing food and great vibe'You order and pay by the counter, then seat yourself at any open table. We didn't have to wait in line but once it was around noon, the whole place was packed with people and there was a line up to the door. Looked like they had sandwiches and other menus but we wanted to try their breakfast menus. Food portions are pretty decent so you won't be leaving this place hungry.Blueberry Ricotta Pancakes ($9): I am not a pancake person. But this might be the BEST PANCAKES I've ever had in my life. Ricotta cheese makes the texture so soft and creamy! Seriously you will regret not getting this.French Toast ($9): Four pieces of toasts with strawberry glaze sauce on top. The sauce almost tastes like strawberry pur√©e or smoothie. It doesn't taste artificially sweet and really adds that natural sour-sweet to the dish.Omelette ($10): Omelette with three ingredients from their list. We picked bacon, swiss cheese, and mushroom. Comes with a side of roasted potatoes. If you are a savory breakfast person, this would be a good dish to go with."
"4.0","First time here, decided to celebrate V-Day a day late, lucky for us they were still serving a price fix menu for the holiday. Win win. Service was good when we got it, but honestly we were kind of ignored for most of the meal. Our waiter was friendly though, just a tad absent. I have to recommend the lobster fries. They were delicious, the lobster was tender and juicy and the gravy/lobster bisque was a perfect addition to the fries. They were a perfect rendition of poutine for this Canadian girl! My husband went with a steak entree from the special V-Day menu and I decided to have sushi. I ordered the yum yum roll. I was considering ordering another smaller roll too, but the yum yum was 10 very large pieces and I ended up bringing 4 home with me. The roll should have stayed in the fryer longer, it was not done as much as it should have been. The same could be said for the onion straws topping my husbands steak. Brown food=flavor people! Smh. Anyways. The roll was good, nice amount of spice. The Flourless chocolate cake with the espresso mousse was also a highlight of the meal. All in all it was good, wasn't spectacular, but it is worth going back again I want to try the brunch one weekend, looking forward to the soft shelled crab bloody mary. That looks fantastic!"
"3.0","Meh. Overall taste is good but definitely pricy. 3 stars for the fact they source local, ingredients are fresh and taste is overall good. I would never pay the full $10 for one of their mini burgers. It's literally the size of 1 White Castle burger. Specialty nights would definitely help this place a little."
"5.0","The food is always fresh, delicious, and speedy! No matter how busy they are! Service is always polite!"
"5.0","Wow. I was not expecting to be blown away but the quality of the sushi fish was beyond compare in the Pittsburgh area. When we first entered, the decor is VERY old, looks like it hasn't changed since 1980. We went on a Sunday night and there were about five tables total in the restaurant. The server was pleasant and efficient, we didn't wait for anything. We tried about fifteen different types of sushi and all were phenomenal. The sushi was the freshest I've ever had. We kept ordering pieces of the toro because it was so buttery and amazing. Even the ginger salad I ordered was good, not just iceberg lettuce. The other Japanese restaurant staple, miso soup, wasn't watery and had tons of flavor. Station Square may be a ghost town but Kiku is a hidden gem. Will definitely be back."
"5.0","Delicious food. Great variety. Best location when going to a gMe. Service a little slow."
"5.0","This place is under new ownership and while the old menu remains, their new specials are out of this world.  On two separate occasions I have had friends tell me that they make the best chicken that they have ever had. (Fried and Grilled)  Their greens are on point, veggies to die for, and the pricing, friendliness, and quality of service is great!.  Best advise, if you're hungry and nearby -- walk in."
"5.0","Perfect sports bar. A big screen TV at every angle for any game you want or Sportscenter if you come during the lunch rush (but come early if you want a seat!) Several local and fun beers on tap. Great atmosphere when watching Steelers, Pens , or Pirates. Everyone from the regulars, to the out of towners, to the staff, all get real into what is going on and the energy is infectious. Not to mention awesome food and drink specials before, during and after the games!One of my favorite places for Happy Hour. Very affordable drink and draft specials 5 days a week. Plus all the fried things your heart can stand for $2 off!The two best nights of the week are Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Taco Tuesday, with $1 hard shell tacos, has recently expanded to include soft shell and fajitas.( slightly higher priced but still very good deal). On Tuesdays you can wash down your tacos with $3.50 Corona. (My signature beer!) . However, that is still not the best deal of the week, that is on Wednesday. Then you can spend $9.99 for all you can eat wings. Redbeard's has close to 15 or so different wet sauces and dry rubs to try. You are going to have to come every Wednesday for at least  2 months to try them all. They start off with 10 wings, with orders of 5 after that. You also get a side of homemade potato chips. I highly recommend this place, whether its for a good dinner ( they are more then just barfood, but still have AWESOME bar food) , a drink on your way to the Northshore, or just a chill weeknight out."
"3.0","I tried this place twice two says in a row because I really wanted to like it! It's too expensive and it's not as good as Chick-Fil-A in my opinion. The chicken sandwich is good but too expensive. The custard desserts don't taste like anything at all. The chicken & waffles are okay but again not worth the price."
"5.0","It's immaculately clean, the service is impeccable and the pastries...Jesus take the wheel! The PASTRIES!!!Seriously, everything is buttery and flakey and sweet and fruity and delicious. I've never been to France, but I friends visited from France and I brought them a sampling and they couldn't stop raving. This morning I picked up a small box of croissants and tartines for the office... people thanked me emphatically. This place is the real deal and worth checking out!"
"4.0","My husband and I stopped into Redbeard's for a night of college football. We had to wait for a table and decided to get a drink at the bar. There were no spaces, but we were happy to learn that there was another bar upstairs with ample standing room. I ordered our drinks, which were okay-mixed cocktails but was pretty astounded when I got the bill. 21 bucks for 2 mixed drinks. A little much for a sports bar, no? However, Redbeard's downtown seems to have upped its game from its Mt. Washington location. It is definitely a bit more trendy feeling, which was fine, but that comes with a price tag. The bars have a ton of big screen TVs, which made it very fun and easy to watch multiple games at once.We finally got seated and ordered our meals. They were very careful about my food allergies, which was great. The manager came over multiple times to make sure our meals were to our liking and allergen free. Wonderful customer service!The food was pretty damn good. I got a bowl of the chili, which is homemade (and free of top 8 allergens!) and the steak salad. They fry in soybean oil, so avoid that if you have the allergy. My husband got dry-rubbed cajun wings and loved them. Our bill was reasonable for the food, so that was a plus. Just be wary of the high drink prices!"
"4.0","The atmosphere was nice.  They took a fairly small space and made it feel pretty big.  I like the name and their logo and the color scheme. Also, staff was super friendly...probably one of the nicest waitresses I ever had. The food was real good and filling and a good price. We had Brussels sprouts which were amazing and some perogies with parsnips, soured radicchio, and pickled mustard seed...a lot of flavor packed into these homemade dumplings.  I would have like a few more options but I'd rather see a limited menu with amazing food vs a large menu with bad food so all in all, good stuff.The beer was pretty good.  I'd give the beer a 7.5 out of 10.  They do a decent IPA...their double IPA is delicious but at 9.8%, a little too strong for me for a lunch.  Also have a coffee IPA that was good if your a coffee fan. Overall, another great addition to the Burgh's food scene and the beer was a great compliment to the meal so I'd definitely recommend."
"5.0","Exceeded my expectations....clean facility including the restrooms, fresh, well prepared and presented food...the Naan bread and Chai tea were excellent.  Server was pleasant and efficient.  Buffet looked inviting and fresh even though it was not busy.  We already have plans to go back and take others.  We had Lamb Masala and Tandoori Chicken."
"4.0","Food:The food is yummy. My dad drives 40 minutes to get gyros in bulk from the Oakland location. The Strip District location keeps the same quality. I ordered the Chicken salad - the meat some well spiced, soft, and juicy. The only reason I didn't get 5 stars is because I like romaine lettuce over iceberg. But I can't complain too much, because they give you 4 servings of chicken on your salad. Well worth the $6. Space:You couldn't tell from the outside, but the restaurant is a huge cafeteria like space. You are sure to find a seat for a large party. But the ambiance could use some work! Service: Fast, polite, accommodating. There is nothing to complain about. I went around 1PM on a Thursday and it was fairly empty...though many people were buying TO GO. I think it's still a hidden gem for downtown! Also the meet is Halal / Kosher."
"1.0","I absolutely love Pamela's on Walnut St., but the remodel is TERRIBLE. My friends and I felt like we were sitting in a hospital cafeteria. Who did they hire to do this? It went from a cozy neighborhood breakfast spot to a room of sterile, tasteless, and tacky d√©cor. Not to mention the construction and paint work is horribly done. Very, VERY disappointed. We will be looking for a new place for our weekend brunches. Dear Pamela's, PLEASE go back to the old d√©cor!"
"4.0","I had been bemoaning the lack of good Indian food in Pittsburgh, as I felt like there was an embarrassment of good options in Boston, so my partner was like, 'Wait, I haven't taken you to Tamarind yet?'Tamarind is located in a renovated house, with very high ceilings, and unsurprisingly has a homey, but classy, environment.  I ordered a mango lassi, the chicken vindaloo, and garlic naan.  The mango lassi was a little sweet for my tastes, and I worried because they didn't ask me how hot I wanted the vindaloo: at a lot of ethnic places that means you get tourist or anglo-level heat, or 'mild'.But when the vindaloo came out it was fragrant and super spicy.  Enough to make my scalp itch [when I told my partner, she though I was a lunatic, so am I the only one who rates the spiciness of food by whether the sweat beads up and my head itches a little?].  Suddenly the sweetness of the mango lassi was just right!  More importantly, as well as being spicy it was delicious. The garlic naan was also tasty.  I will definitely go back.  I have to try the 'Chicken 65', described as marinated, fried chicken, there take on a classicl Indian street food.  While we were there, a party of about 15 people came in, all speaking Hindi to each other, and they ordered half a dozen plates of what I assume was the Chicken 65 to share: I need to get some of that!"
"5.0","The hotcakes are *delicious*.  I had a strawberry filling in mine.  It was really sweet, and the brown sugar in the filling might have been somewhat excessive, but it was a really nice treat.If you live in Pittsburgh, I *highly* recommend you try Pamela's.  I know I'll be going back when I can."
"5.0","Working in the Steel building, there are some sad options to choose from at lunch time. Luckily, Craft Work is one of two options (the other being Istanbul grille) that satiate the hungry without having to eat overpriced chain fast food. Everything I have eaten here has been great. My favorite, by far, is the porkgasm sandwich. Pulled pork, cheddar, pickles, chipotle mayo and barbecue sauce. This sandwich is a go-to when I'm having a bad day that can only be made better with food. The breakfast sandwiches and burritos are fresh and delicious every time. They also serve coffee which is great if you're not a fan of Starbucks like myself."
"5.0","Had small plates and drinks with friends mid-week and the food was amazing!!! The Brussels sprouts were so delicious we got two orders. Our server Melissa was fantastic though the place was clearly busy.  We even got to compete in a music trivia competition which was super fun and unexpected.  The neighborhood was really charming, walked over from the Incline. Would definitely come back the next time I'm in Pittsburgh! Highly recommend!"
"5.0","This restaurant is the best one I've been to in a long time. The service is great the food is great! I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves a nice romantic atmosphere"
"4.0","A slightly grubby restaurant in a slightly grubby part of town. But the food was pretty good. In particular, the naan was very well prepared and tasty. We also had the aloo gobi masala and the kadai fry with okra which were both good. The raita was a bit watery but the daal tasted great.Excellent value for money."
"4.0","We both had the chicken sandwich and shared a salad.  I got the medium and it was a good amount of heat to it.  The chicken was crispy and amazingly juicy.  The salad was just ok as the chicken was just bite size pieces.  I will come back."
"4.0","Came here for lunch today and I'm a fan! The service was quick and friendly. I had the Shadyside burger and ordered it medium well - I think it was a little more cooked than I prefer it, so next time I'll get it medium. The burger itself was well seasoned and the toppings were perfect. Their grilled mushrooms are especially delicious! I had regular fries with my burger and they were nice and crispy. Definitely will be back again!"
"5.0","Love love love the food and people! I never have a bad experience here and I always bring my out of town friends to my local favourite :)"
"4.0","Having lived in Dubai, Doha, and Manama for several years, this place definitely does a wonderful job of inviting me to relive some of my favorite culinary memories. Wicked friendly staff, tasty food, wide selection. The market next door, also operated by Salem's is full of Middle Eastern goodies."
"5.0","A little pricey, but I can't say I've ever left hungry or unhappy. A simple, well-done spot that I could come to over and over."
"4.0","Went for a smaller dinner in the bar.  Been dying to try the burger after a recommendation over a year ago.  It was very juicy and flavorville. Glad i passed on 5 guys. Added a nice caesar salad with anchovies.  Service was great.  I love their bread!"
"5.0","The Kona Crust steak is the best! I always love to come celebrate special occasions here. The service is always so great and accommodating here. Thank you for all the wonderful experiences I've had."
"3.0","The quality of pizza here is on par with any of the other joints in the Oakland area such as Sorrento's or Antoon's. The prices are slightly higher, but it seems the pies here are made to order rather than being premade."
"4.0","Free WiFi and restroom with spacious seating. Coffee and pastries are reasonably priced which was a nice surprise since it's smack dab downtown Pittsburgh. People working here? Not so friendly but oh well, maybe they are jaded from the city folk. Free check in offer too which is lovely. I had an americano and pistachio eclair (yes, it's a thing!) and it was delightful."
"2.0","Hrm, I've never really enjoyed a meal at Tamarind. I've had the lunch buffet a couple of times (seemed like the same lame stuff both times) and have ordered dinner from the menu on several occasions. Nothing has ever seemed very fresh and I've not experienced any serious spice here. The tamarind sauce (which you'd think would be their specialty), in addition to all of their condiments, taste generic rather than scratch-made. The dinner entrees come with a side of veggies or dal, and I swear they just give you leftovers from the lunch buffet. For example, I got a side consisting of crusty looking peas and carrots with random stuff dropped in; a lentil and a piece of cauliflower stalk. The rice also seemed reminiscent of buffet recycling measures. I hate to think of food getting wasted, but I'd go dumpster diving before paying $11 for food that most restaurants would either throw away for fear of contamination, or at least freshen up to make their parsimony less obvious. My Baingan Bhartha, a totally mild '10,' was tasty enough, however it didn't have any peas in it (it's supposed to, even according to their menu). Best bet is probably to order dosas, because at least you can count on them being made to order.I have witnessed some off service here, like this last time they basically seated a gal at the service station (a table pushed up against another table where they store and retrieve the silverware, water pitchers, napkins etc.), even though the restaurant was empty with the exception of me. The girl moved herself to a more desirable table.I love the painting with the squirrel and tamarind pod."
"3.0","Friesssss all day! What did I getMy friend brought me here for happy hour. I got the highball which was $5 for drinks like rum and coke. I also got their happy hour fries! Which turns out to be $2.50 a basket! The sauces that comes with it wasn't free! You need to pay for them, I wish she told me that though.... I like the seasoning that's in the fries. They were goodEnvironmentThis is on a chain of 3 restaurants put together! This one is on the rooftop and when the weather is great they open it. It was good. The seating is open seating but you can always ask the servers for a table and they will make sure they secure a table for you!Niceness of the staffShe was very nice to take our orders. I wish she told me that the sauces were extra. Not that I care but it would be great to know....DollarIts a great place during happy hour, get a couple of drinks with great views.Yes?Yea I wouldn't mind going here again, those happy hour snacks all look great! Im interested to see what the place would be like during winter! Definitely keeping this in my directory#WendyWanders"
"5.0","Greatest tasting Tom Yum (lemongrass soup) in Pittsburgh hands down.  Many of their curries including 'Garlic' are really good, as is the Massamun, and they have these neat samosa dumplings that remind you of India!  Very nice family, they have a monk son who sometimes shows up wearing his orange robes straight from the Far East!  Awesome 'clean hole in the wall' feel and recently remodeled."
"5.0","This is my favorite Chinese place. They have been around forever in the same location which speaks volumes about the place. It's a nice atmosphere with very friendly staff. The egg rolls are huge and the best around. I usually get my meal extra spicy. You get huge portions for the price you pay. Very fast service too. Give this place a try."
"4.0","This is a solid place for a casual night out. I came here with my husband on a Friday night and this place was packed. We were seated in the back room which was full and while I loved the aesthetic of the big open room, it was very loud and difficult to have a conversation. The menu is limited but everything on it sounds amazing. I decided to go with the fried chicken sandwich and my husband ordered the soft shell crab. One of the reasons we chose to come here is that it's so rare to see a restaurant offer soft shell crab around here! We both enjoyed our sandwiches but were a little disappointed by the fries. I love shoestring fries but these were lacking crunch and flavor. As far as beer, I tried both the saison and chai beer. I found them to be just okay, but did appreciate how unique the beer offerings were and would definitely come back when they rotate their selection. Overall, I'd give this place a 3.5/5. Has potential to be exceptional, but as it is, it's just okay."
"5.0","Nikki and Abbie are QUEENS! They offered us amazing customer service and gave us exactly the pizza we were hoping for! If you're the manager reading this, please give them a raise. Great pizza, fun people!"
"2.0","Sausalido has been on of our favorites for a while, but what was once a great, intimate, fun place to go for unique and extraordinarily well-prepared food, has declined to a below-average experience.   Our most recent visit is an example.  What was once great service, has now become sloppy, inconsistent and inattentive.   Our server didn't pour the wine we brought, forgot the bread and bean dip, and while he refilled our water glasses ever ten seconds, he left clearly empty plates lying on the table for far too long.  The chef had to keep hollering from the kitchen to the staff to come pick up food.   Major upgrade needed here.Food quality seems to have declined a bit as well.   The appetizers were great, with the smoked gouda app and the meatball app being highlights.   The meatballs are delicious, huge, easily enough to share.   But the entrees were lacking in basic preparation.    My duck dish came out not medium, but still quacking, and had to be sent back.   This is not a case of someone not liking rare duck -- the meat was cold and raw.    One of our guests had a steak that was likewise mis-cooked, only in this case, medium-well versus medium rare.    Maybe a bad night at the grill station, but this shouldn't happen.   During a prior visit, the risotto was perfectly cooked, but very poorly seasoned and assembled -- a heavy hand with the salt, and only the most minuscule bits of shaved steak to augment a giant bowl.The signature dish, the pork chop, was still fantastic, and huge.   One guest of ours will have leftovers for 2 meals.   But overall, Sausalido seems to be headed in the wrong direction.   Hoping it can return to it's former glory, but we won't be back anytime soon."
"2.0","Hey there if you're in the area avoid this place today.  We were greeted by someone whom was obviously ready to go home and then waited 30 mins to be seated and the place was near empty. Come to find out the problem is staff called out.  Ordered queso and chips and it took 20 mins to get that. My drink was good 'hall of fame'. We have been here over an hour and still no order.  We ordered 2 burgers (plainish) and boneless wings. We are leaving with no food."
"4.0","We stop here often before shows in the Cultural District.  Always get seated right away, food is always good, service is solid. Never had a problem or complaint."
"5.0","Total Awesomeness!!! Best tacos I've ever had. From the second you walk in the door the authentic aromas and d√©cor draw you closer, the friendly and engaging staff draw you closer and then the food...oh the food!!! If one passes this place up for a burger or some other quick meal they would truly be missing out on a little piece of heaven in a shell!"
"1.0","I went in the restaurant to look at the menu and the owner was very rude. I felt rushed to look at the menu and pressured to order my food. Their was a young boy at the register waiting to ring me up and the owner moved him to the side with a nasty attitude and asked me what do I want!!! But mind you I wasn't done looking at the menu. And I felt rushed. It's one thing if the employees are rude but it's a lot more if the owner is rude too! This place will NEVER EVER receive any of my hardworking funds........ that was my first time there and it definitely was my last!"
"5.0","I am always looking for better sushi in the Pittsburgh area, and it looks like I found one. I was told by many people to try Kiku, and I was not disappointed when I did. The sushi was, almost, melt your mouth good. There was no fishy odor, and you can taste how fresh the fish was. It was a quiet restaurant, and had very out of date d√©cor. To me the only downside is the location, and the look is very out of date, at least in comparison to other Pittsburgh restaurants. But do not judge this book by its cover.The restaurant is actually on the inside of the station square mall, on the bottom floor."
"3.0","We went to Thai Gourmet on a Friday night after we had tried to go to the Bloomfield Bridge Tavern across the street and they were closed for a private party!  Bummer!  Anyway, the overall experience at Thai Gourmet was very positive.   I ordered the crispy Spring rolls, Spicy Coconut chicken soup and Panang chicken curry.   The Spring rolls and soup were excellent and the curry was good, but not the best I have every had.  Don't get me wrong, I would go here again in a heartbeat, but this wasn't as good as some that I've had in the past.  The service was excellent and the prices were very reasonable.  Definitely worth checking out."
"4.0","Guys if you want Thai that will knock your socks off then you need to Bloomfield and be prepared for it to happen!The Pad Thai is my go to because holy moly it's delicious!I'm a spice level 5/6 kind of girl and they nail it.I've never had a bad experience here. If you have friends coming to town, take them off the beaten path for a hot bite."
"4.0","We stopped in on a Tuesday afternoon. Service was very friendly. Ambiance is super comfortable. Food was great, the chicken pesto asparagus salad was amazing. Heavy on the pesto but that's what I love! Had a Blue Moon and it made an excellent early dinner."
"5.0","I'm visiting from out of town and glad I found this place. It's located on the strip. It's good and fresh!! The lobster bisque is the best I have ever had. It has chunks of lobster and melts in your mouth. The ahi tuna is FedEx fresh everyday from Honolulu. The atmosphere is neighborhood bar with all ages. The bartender Jamie was amazing and very attentive. She helped me pick a local brewed beer and recommended the ahi tuna plate which couldn't get any better than that."
"1.0","Took forever to get food when not busy, fries came out close to 10 minutes after the sandwich and were undercooked. Sandwich was decent though, would've been nice to have mushrooms and onions on my mushroom steak melt."
"2.0","I also had high hopes. In fact I drove from wintersville for good sushi. Instead I got low end sushi for a high end price. The service was 5 stars so feel bad giving two. The. Food was one star. So 5 stars minus two stars equals really bad sushi."
"4.0","If you catch this place early enough, you can get in quickly, no prob.  Wait too long and you will keep waiting in line.  We have only been for breakfast and the food has been good and very filling.  Seems like all plates served with potatoes, no complaints on those.  I like that you pay upfront and then hang out while your food is being made.  I also like the open kitchen design so you can see what is going on."
"5.0","Luke C just an FYI about our walnut at restaurant. Pam and Gail by no means designers but plain old pittsburgh gals are responsible for this change. But the good news is the focal point will be walls of pittsburgh everyday people young and old done by local artist and muralist Sandy Kessler Kaminski. Give us another try in August. Art takes time. But no matter what we still have the same Hotcakes and homefries. Hope to see you soon. Gail Klingensmith"
"4.0","Really awesome tacos! I am glad they are on yelp now- we visited when they first opened and I was disappointed that I could not rush on here & rave about this place; now I can =].I am SUPER glad to see another taco place in the Southside. Considering tacos are one of my FAVORITE things to eat, I was super excited to check it out. The inside is small and super cute and the staff are very friendly.My boyfriend and I tried their American style taco, another beef one (can't think of the name) and the chicken taco. We both agree that the chicken taco was the best and is now the only one I will order. Don't get me wrong, the beef was not bad- but I have had better. The chicken is packed with fresh flavors like fresh salsa and avocado and is just incredibly tasty. At $3 a taco, this place is a steal.What's REALLY awesome about this place? They are open late!It was a Sunday night when we visited again, probably around 9:30 pm. I was starved and couldn't think of what I could eat in Southside besides pizza. We walked past this place and I couldn't believe they were open. My taste buds were really happy.This place is great. Go there now."
"2.0","Good food, horrible service. If you have thick skin, you can definitely eat here. But if you are prone to being offended when someone's rude to you, this is not the place to go."
"1.0","Customer Service: 1 (the host was the best interaction)Staff Menu Knowledge: 0Food Quality: 0Food Presentation: 5The restaurant is falling apart, and no table around me was bussed the entire time I was there.I hated everything about my meal except for the presentation of it and didn't even end up eating it, I actually sent it back, still paid for it and no management interacted with me at all about the issue. Asked our server multiple questions about items on the menu and he couldn't answer a single one, and if he did he was wrong about the answers. Not the best experience. When I think Pittsburgh and I think North Shore, Bettis Grille is a staple, but now with all the new restaurants around that area, any of them are your better bet."
"4.0","I love Pittsburgh, PA it's a great city with great people. Being from San Francisco born and raised and Latino at times I've found it difficult to find a place that sells decent tacos and Latin food in PGH. I'm glad Doce taqueria is in the southside and just a few blocks away from where I stay when I visit. The tacos and beans are legit. I love the fact that they use queso fresco and crema. Staples for Latin food. The chicken and carnitas are on point. The tortillas are great and it's awesome that they give you options of corn or flour. The beans have a nice kick to them and go well paired with a couple tacos. Most importantly Steve and Carrie who work at Doce are great people who you can tell care about the quality of the food and make sure patrons are doing well. I'll be back in town soon and looking forward to having a few tacos and chatting with Steve and Carrie again."
"5.0","Umami is one of the five basic tastes, which some describe as meaty or brothy. YUM!First - I almost walked right by this place! The restaurant is on the third floor and the bathrooms are on the second floor.  Second- The private room looks so fancy, like it would be perfect for a birthday party, with traditional low seating and curtain for extra swankiness.Third- The bar is beautiful and long, with an overwhelming selection of drinks. Fourth- If you are there to eat, sit in front of the kitchen. It looks like the opening scene in Spirited Away when Chihiro's parents eat the food made for the spirits and get turned into pigs. I ordered a bowl of ramen, but  it was so big, I had no hope of finishing it. Also, order the chicken skin on the stick. It is so fatty and yummy, perfectly crispy. Finally, umami doesn't just describe the food- the cooks certainly fit that description too *wink*"
"4.0","Was here to eat on 10/4 before a show at Heinz hall.  I've heard good things about this place but have never stopped here before so tonight was the night to stop in and check it out and I'm glad I did.  The selection of food is the typical pub style food as you would expect from a bar but their selections were great I thought.  Overall this place is great and will be stopping in again when I'm in downtown for a bite to eat.  Great service and all the waiters and waitresses seemed to be on top of their game.  I would recommend to anyone wanting to check this place out."
"5.0","The chorizo and egg breakfast sandwich is outstanding, mainly because of how delicious and buttery its roll is. Strong coffee and very friendly, helpful staff."
"5.0","What an amazing lunch! And such a large portion that didn't even need to eat dinner!  This will be a regular spot for me."
"4.0","This was a cool, yet casual, spot to spend quality time with friends. The beers (particularly the Stout options) were excellent and the food was good as well. My group had the upstairs section to ourselves, which allowed us to be together without feeling secluded from the rest of the restaurant. I just wish it was open later!"
"3.0","Went there for the wings which were so-so. We had to wait forever for our food and then for  our check. Next time I'll just go to Quaker State and Lube."
"4.0","I'm not very familiar with Japanese cuisine, so I came here with the hopes of stepping out of my comfort zone- and I did! We started with the pork belly robatayaki, which was yummy. I really enjoyed the meat but I'm not used to just getting a skewer of meat with nothing else to balance flavors. I'd still get it again though. We also had the takoyaki, which are fried balls with octopus in the center. Those were fantastic! I would definitely recommend trying those. Finally, for my meal, I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen. This was jam-packed with flavor, especially sesame."
"5.0","Umami-you're doing it right.Excellent experience on a Saturday night at Umami. Loved sitting with a view of the kitchen where the magic happens. Food came out super speedily: shrimp tempura ($10, huge shrimp! different breading than expected but still pretty tasty), chirashi ($18, so fresh! loved the roe and flower decoration and especially the quail egg), miso deviled eggs ($6, tasty but nothing to write home about), and...drumroll please...nasu shigiyaki ($10). It was the surprise highlight of our meal. Delicately spiced minced chicken filled it and paired wonderfully with the softness of the cooked eggplant. It was sweet and savory and once; my dining partner and I both agreeed we would get it again. All cocktails we tried were well-balanced! The vibe was high-end/classy without being pretentious. You could definitely bring a date here. It would set the mood well. We will definitely be back another time to try more items on the outstanding menu!"
"5.0","My favorite Thai restaurant in town. Love the green and red curry and the nam prik."
"4.0","Cafe Raymond had absolutely no vegan options. So maybe that's partially the reason they didn't receive 5 stars as well other than that the atmosphere.  Speed of service and overall atmosphere was amazing. Walked in they greeted us immediately gave us a number and seated us all before even making it to the order to register.  That's when I was disappointed because there wasn't anything that I could eat. My friend thought that I should add that his food was great. It came out very hot and he really enjoyed it."
"4.0","Had catering from here last week, and loved it! I've never been in person.  Indian food is always veg friendly, so I should really be eating more of it.The items we had:Matar Paneer: cheese cubes in an incredible tomato-cream sauce with grean peas. I'm not even a fan of peas and I loved this! It was just the right mix of spicy and rich.Chana Masala: stewed chickpeas that were spicier than I was expecting, but also really good.Palak Aloo: It's usually hit or miss with me with Indian spinach dishes - this was the weakest of the three, as it was the least flavorful.The naan is the perfect level of chewiness, even after time in transit - that made me so happy! All in all very good, will probably hit up the buffet sometime in the near future."
"5.0","Great cheap taco stand. The key is the meat, which is excellently seasoned. Try the carnitas 'mexican style' with only onion, cilantro and lime juice. Fast service from the street side stall makes for a quick, delicious lunch. I'd skip the nachos personally and stick to the meat, though. It's all about the meat."
"5.0","My partner and I have been coming here for years.  We also bring friends along who are either Thai food lovers or just adventurous.  The atmosphere is eclectic and the crowds are casual.  The staff is personable, cheerful and smiling.  They are willing to make suggestions as well as modify a dish to your liking.  The spice scale goes from non-existent at 0 to a scorching 10.The food is fresh, individually made, service is quick and server attentiveness is just right.   Water is always filled, extra rice is not a problem and I have seen many of the same customers in there for years now.  The Todd munn is a favorite; crisp and hot patties of whitefish, chili and green bean fried to perfection. Fresh rolls are fresh egg roll wrappers filled with rice, basil, carrot, and your choice of shrimp or tofu...both worth trying with the wonderful dipping sauce. The array of curries is excellent, especially the Mussuman. The noodle dishes are great with your choice of meat or sea food.   If you can't find something to enjoy at Thai Gourmet, then you really do not like Thai food."
"5.0","This cozy little bar nestled atop Mt. Washington is the perfect place for a romantic date or to meet some friends for a drink. It's candlelit ambiance sets the scene for any intimate gathering. The bartenders are knowledgeable and will make some fancy and unique cocktails, and they have a great selection of craft beer. Rich, one of the bartenders, recommended a great beer I'd never heard of based on my prior selections and I was not disappointed. My friend and I shared the pork confit al pastor tacos and the warm spinach and feta dip. They were both really flavorful and delicious. Warning: get there early on a Friday night as you may not be able to get a seat. It is very small. I would definitely recommend this place if you want upscale bar food (if that's such a thing) and a casual yet intimate atmosphere."
"2.0","The food here is average. Very bland and not a lot of flavor. It also is served suspiciously fast, which makes me question whether it is from scratch or purchased pre-made from a food supplier and simply reheated. I probably wouldn't choose to come back here unless invited by friends who really wanted to come."
"4.0","I recently just started eating at Raymonds and the food there is very delicious. My first two times I went there I got to go orders. But today I stopped in and sat down to eat so that I can do some business work but could not get Wi-Fi on my cell phone. I asked one of the servers for the Wi-Fi password and I was told that they could not give it to me it is just for them to use. So I was on able to do anything that I needed to do. Although the food is good, I don't think I will return it because There is no Wi-Fi available."
"4.0","You've got to come here during Restaurant Week to score a deal. Otherwise, it can get pretty expensive here. Came here for lunch during Restaurant Week and the deal was such a steal. For $16, you get a three course meal.  I thoroughly enjoyed my meal which consisted of a wedge salad, a sirloin, and a flourless chocolate espresso cake. Honestly, no complaints with the meal whatsoever. The salad was...well it's salad. The sirloin was well-seasoned and cooked exactly as ordered. And the cake was amazing, which I must say, the name is a little misleading. It's more like a cream or a fudge than a cake. However, was it the best meal I've had? I've had better. I feel that to get the best out of The Capital Grille, I would need to order the filet at dinner time. I would definitely come back here again but I will probably wait for Restaurant Week to avoid paying full price. Yes, I am that cheap! Otherwise, the food is good and the dining experience here is nice!"
"4.0","Outstanding waitressNice house cured meats.Tasty and interesting pizza.PA Cheese Board with apple butter was delicious.Pistachio and Porchetta with Arugula pizza was sweet and tasty.Margherita pizza was good too!Looks like Yelp may finally have it figured out.  You can actually do a search for Mezzo and get it...have been waiting about six months for that..LOL"
"2.0","4 stars my right butt cheek. There for a full evening (dinner party), every course was begging for some food network intervention. 2 stars is because the servers were nice. Avoid everything I had...eggplant lasagne (cold and solid), Oreo creek br√ªl√©e (oreos crumbled on bad creme br√ªl√©e), and a block of fried cheddar (supposed to be mozerella but replaced without telling us...didn't think I was a food court). Any doubts, I can pull 4+ others into this review."
"5.0","First class Restaurant, food, and staff. Bone-In Filet was out of this world. Double think lamb chops were best I ever had. Very accommodating to allergies. Already planning to come back."
"5.0","Ordered a bacon pizza which came over fifteen minutes earlier than projected. Food was hot and fresh, great dough and taste. Awesome pizza spot with quality ingredients, fresh taste and quick delivery."
"4.0","This is our third time back in the month of March.  Service is markedly better when it's not as busy.  Since our three visits, we managed to meet both Robert Wholey and his son who always graciously thank us for our patronage really creating a great atmosphere.  The community element needs to come back to every restaurant!We came this time exclusively for sushi.  The final verdict is that nothing beats the Utsukushi Roll.  We came here to try other rolls for comparison, but nothing seems to compete.  While most of the food won't disappoint, there are true winners and gems at Luke Wholey's Wild Alaskan Grille. Kevin was an especially great waiter.  'in heaven with Kevin' as he would say.  Super attentive and friendly albeit mistaken about the Yum Yum roll tasting better than the Utsukushi."
"1.0","Sausalido used to be one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I had only been there a few months ago and was very happy with my meal and the service.My last visit was a different story. The service was HORRENDOUS, probably the worst I've ever experienced, and the food seems to have gone downhill too. When we arrived our server (an older man with glasses) somehow brought us 4 waters for 2 people, this was not a big deal, but the table space was limited so we didn't need the extra glasses. He then brought us our bread and bean dip before taking our order. We waited almost 40 MINUTES before we were even asked for our order. The waiter did not apologize, we were unsure if he even realized his mistake. He then brought us more bread and bean dip, I think not realizing that he had already brought us some, but that was a good thing since we had already been waiting 40 minutes to order. I remember from previous visits the salad that comes with the meal was very good, it had beets in it and I believe there was always a special house-made dressing, last time I was there it was a raspberry dressing. The waiter only gave us the option of Italian dressing this time, which was house-made, but I was disappointed because I'm not a huge Italian dressing fan. We later heard another waiter giving another table more options, so I guess that they had them, we just were not made aware of them. My boyfriend also requested no salad, but the waiter brought him one anyways. When my salad arrived, I also discovered it had changed, it was a regular house salad with tomatoes, not the one with beets that I remembered.Unfortunately our main courses were not as good as our previous visits either. My boyfriend ordered the steak, and I ordered the daily fish, which was tilapia. The portion sizes were big, I received 2 pieces of fish, however the dish lacked flavor. This was surprising considering the description said the fish had a 'grilled pineapple curry butter.' My fish tasted basically like buttered fish, with minimal butter, and the black bean mixture that came with it also lacked flavor. I tasted no curry flavoring, and there were 3 tiny canned pineapple sized chunks on my 2 pieces of fish. I probably could have made this dish at home, maybe even made it more flavorful. My boyfriend also said his steak was not a good cut of meat. When we were done with our meals the server also took forever to get us our box, even when there were only 6 tables left in the restaurant. Other customers seemed annoyed as well, their waters, etc were not being filled.I hate to give this place a bad review, but I had the worst service I have ever experienced, and the food was disappointing too. It's a shame, but I will probably not be back."
"3.0","First I want to say this is the location in Southside. If this was the food truck it would be a dramatically different story.but to be honest I was quite underwhelmed going to Doce Taqueria. I don't see all the hype. They are just 3 dollar tacos... it isn't bad I would say it's just decent.What puts it at a 3/5 is the space. You are stuck in an extremely crammed area which can't seat more than 10 people. An the menu is unapproachable since I had no idea what half of the options on the menu exactly are. If they had a description of what the options where like most other foreign restaurants it would help it dearly."
"4.0","I always love love love the food here,  but seriously dislike the coffee,  and I'm usually pretty easy going with coffee."
"5.0","We checked this place out for lunch after seeing what great reviews it already had. It did not disappoint! I have never had a smash burger before and I'm so glad my first one was from here. The fries were out of this world too. The beers were delicious and the variety was great for both me and my husband. Definitely a delicious, affordable spot in Pittsburgh!"
"5.0","A very good steakhouse. Definitely on the more luxurious and delicious side of the scale. The Porterhouse, grilled mushrooms and asparagus were superb. Definitely recommended for special occasions."
"2.0","Have eaten here several times when I was living in Pittsburgh..... Sometimes it just felt like its the frozen food that is served..,, have different experiences every time I have been here..."
"5.0","Walking in the door we were warmly greeted and seated. The place is romantic, cozy and inviting. The craft beer list is on point!! We enjoyed fries with 4 dipping sauces and watching people play games from the Summits in house board game collection. Really really cool place :)You can trust me, I'm in the business ;D"
"5.0","Before we walked in we were greeted with a smile and how are you.  The staff were friendly, attentive, and able to answer questions quickly.  It was Wednesday so we had the added surprise of $5 wine night.  The bread was that perfect crusty messy outside with soft fluffy insides.  We started with the fried zucchini.  It was exactly what you want in fried zucchini.  The zucchini was nice and thick and the breading was thin, crispy, and light.  The accompanying tomato sauce was thick and perfect.  For our main dishes I got the fried ravioli with tomato sauce and meatball.  My fianc√© got linguine with a tomato, garlic, basil sauce.  The fried ravioli were crispy and the perfect amount and the sauce was nice and thick and clung to the pasta.  The meatball was good, not the best, not the worst, just a good meatball.  My fianc√©'s dinner was perfection.  I kept stealing the tomatoes which were completely infused with the garlic and basil.  We ended with the tiramisu which was the perfect end to dinner.The decor and atmosphere is so cozy and everyone makes you feel so welcome.  The prices are very reasonable and all in all we truly enjoyed ourselves, the food, and the wine."
"1.0","Complete disappontment..SLOW service, often empty soft-drink glasses, not impressed with the rib-eye (lots of grissle), desserts meh.  Several cabernets on the list, out of all, and they offered  Menage-a-Trois instead, wow...Party of 9, literally two and one-half hours (over half the place was completely empty), and one worker, no joke, commented when we noticed that one dessert was flat and half the size of the other two said, 'I just work here'.Jerome may have been the BUS on the field, but his joint is a flat tire in my book..."
"4.0","I had lunch here yesterday. The service was quick for a Monday. They had plenty of people working. I ordered the Ni√ßoise salad. The lemon dressing was refreshing. The salad was huge. I was only able to eat half. They have great prices for lunch and quick service. This is the second time I've been here and will continue to come back."
"3.0","This place was okay, not the best Chinese food. I had the veggie egg rolls (these are giant and pretty good). The sweet and sour soup is very spicy but has what looked like beef inside which made it a little bit odd. The szechuan shrimp was okay, the sauce wasn't too great. The beef lo mein was also okay but some of the pieces of meat were flavorless. The water kind of tastes like dust lol"
"5.0","What a fantastic place. And the food is  absolutely delicious! My favorites ... the classic burger, the ham and gruyere croissant, the smoked salmon platter. Hey! The list goes on and on. And don't forget the soup and quiche. I always top off my meal with one of Ray's homemade pastries. Take your pick. Trust me on this one. They're sinfully good. Breakfast? I do an omelet and then treat myself to either ricotta pancakes or french toast---drizzled with some kind of strawberry sauce. It's my morning desert. This place alone is worth a trip to the Strip. Oh! Mercy! Forgot to mention the BLT on a croissant. Just might be my favorite. Shucks. Least I forget. The grilled cheese sandwich!!!!!"
"4.0","Freshii is conveniently located right next to a lot of larger businesses! It's a great option for a quick, healthy meal. The interior is modern and the wait staff is friendly and quick. I got the mediterranean bowl, which was very flavorful! I believe that it was priced a little bit high, but I had an overall nice experience! I hope to be back, and I would give it a recommendation. I hear the burritos are incredible, so I will definitely try that next!"
"1.0","ridiculously over priced. spent $12 on two double espressos. the girl working didn't know the difference between chai and latte. would never recommend as a cafe."
"4.0","This is a nice little BYOB in Pittsburgh.  They have table service even though it seems more of a place to go and pick up something.  I had the tofu curry which was awesome.  I liked how you can pick how spicy you want it to be on a scale of 1-10.  I got a 6 and it was plenty spicy!"
"5.0","I had to give this place an update. I knocked off a star because they used to be inconsistent in their offerings but they have remedied that issue. My husband and I go here at least once a week and it is amazing. The service is awesome too! They remember us and always make us feel appreciated. Note that the hours on here are wrong. They are open through dinner every night."
"4.0","A party of 6 (3 adults and 3 children) of us out-of-towners came here last Saturday  night without a reservation.  So make sure you call and make a reservation. If not, you'll wait at least half an hour depending upon how quickly the food comes out and how quickly the patrons eat and go.The service is prompt, the staff is friendly and accomodating, and the place has a relaxing atmosphere.  It's a BYOB. The entrees are the perfect portion, and very tasty.  And it's not terribly expensive either. Entrees ordered were: 'Chilly' Gobi appetizer which is a heavily battered cauliflower appetizer topped with a spicy chili sauce Butter Chicken which has a tomato red cream sauce Lamb Curry (can't recall specific name) the color of green and very spicy Tandoori Chicken which was served sizzling hot on an iron flat skillet surrounded by onions and green peppersWish we had ordered the bread basket though."
"5.0","For a first time experience, this place was GREAT. We came at around 12 on a Wednesday, so the place was pretty empty and we were seated immediately. The service was what you hope for when you go out...we had Chris and he was completely attentive, knowledgeable, and just so upbeat and happy he made our first time excellent. He went out of his way to make sure we were happy! The food was WOW! We came for the lunch menu, so it was very reasonably priced (im not sure what dinner is like). Obviously you have to come with a taste for seafood, but they have an incredible selection of sandwiches, entrees, apps, and sushi. My group for the ahi tuna sandwich, lobster roll, and shrimp po boy and we all left completely satisfied but not over stuffed which was perfect! Absolutely recommend this place if your looking for something perfect to eat in the strip."
"3.0","I went here on Friday after hearing for years how amazing it was. I was not overly impressed,  mostly because the menu was not that exciting. The salad I had was amazing - it had pears, spiced nuts and bibb lettuce. I then ordered the tenderloin sliders...they were good, but nothing mind blowing.  Here is where they lost me...expensive truffle fries that weren't anything special.  Also, our waitress seemed overwhelmed and wasn't overly friendly.  Overall,  it was a good meal, but not worth the price."
"4.0","This place is fantastic, byob, reasonable prices.  It doesn't look like much from the outside but it is very cozy inside.  I highly recommend it to anyone who loves thai."
"4.0","Love the general tao chicken.. Spicy level 7 is preferred. It is best to eat in because the food tends to be a bit soggy when it's a pickup order. That's probably because of the container lid being closed."
"2.0","This place has almost no redeeming qualities. I've been here twice and both times I was underwhelmed. On my first visit I went with one other person and we ordered some appetizers and got  the buffet. It was about 6 pm on a Thursday and the place was deserted. The appetizers came out of the kitchen hot, and they were pretty yummy. Except for the paneer pakora -- that was just boring. As other reviewers have mentioned, everything on the buffet is just dull and seemed like it had been there for a while. Malai kofta was one of the buffet options and it's one of my favorites. I was very disappointed. The dumplings had raisins in them or something of similar size that was sweet and squishy. Very unappetizing. The sauce wasn't nearly creamy enough to be a proper malai kofta. By the time we left there were more people trickling in, but the place isn't very popular, for good reason.On my second trip (I only returned because someone had a Groupon), the place was equally deserted. Again, just a party of two. Since, I'd already experienced the buffet we decided to order off the menu. Keep in mind the restaurant was empty, so when the waiter came over to take our order we were expecting awesome service. We certainly weren't expecting him to answer the phone that was attached to his hip and stand in front of our table chatting with someone in another language. I generally like listening to people speak in languages I don't understand, but standing right next to me for an uncomfortably long time while I'm trying to chat with my dining companion was just rude. We did finally get to order though. We ordered garlic naan and another kind of naan as well as tarka dal and the malai kofta (I advised against this). Now, I didn't know what tarka dal was when I ordered it, but it was described as a bean dish with lots of ginger. Sounded like my kind of thing and I wanted to order something that I didn't think would be on the buffet. When our food arrived I was very disappointed to see that he brought us dal makhani instead. The waiter even called it tarka dal when he set it down. I might have known what tarka dal was, but I sure as hell can recognize my absolute favorite Indian dish when you put it in front of me! A simple internet search was enough to convince us that there was no way tarka dal could be some variation of dal makhani since the two dishes are generally made with completely different lentils and are therefore different colors! The kitchen just didn't want to make the damned tarka dal and brought us the stuff that was on the buffet! The malai kofta was, again, icky. No raisin-things this time, but the nuts in the dumplings were almond slivers, not cashews. The two kinds of naan we ordered were nothing but soggy, salty piles of grease. All that and the service never improved. Drink refills were slow, we didn't even bother asking for another round of drinks from the bar, and it took far too long to get the check. In hindsight, I'm a glad they didn't actually bring me tarka dal when I ordered it. I'm sure they would have just messed it up. I've since made it myself and it's delicious. I recommend you try it, just not here. Don't eat here."
"4.0","Very tasty breakfast sandwich with special ham.  The coffee was good.  The potatoes had a nice spice."
"5.0","Sausalido was a great place to have our rehearsal dinner! They have a private upstairs room which was great for our large party. The food was excellent and I got many compliments from our guests.  Their prices were incredibly reasonable for the amount of food that was served. Overall we had bread with dip, salad, 2 appetizers, pasta, chicken, salmon and dessert. The wait staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. Even though they had multiple call offs, they made sure to have enough staff for our party. The owner's wife even came in to help! We also had a few guests with strict gluten free/dairy free diets and they were able to accommodate them as well. They also had no corkage fee on wine which was appreciated! They boxed up all the leftover food and wine for us at the end of the night and made sure all the guests were properly taken care of throughout the night. Overall, I would highly recommend Sausalido for a rehearsal dinner/large dinner party due to their high food quality, friendly wait staff and reasonable prices."
"5.0","We have Ben coming here for over 5 years and ever time it has ben perfect (if not they make perfect) so if your looking for the best of the best in Pittsburgh look no further than the Capital Grill!!! Tip Kona crusted filet is my favorite"
"5.0","This place is delicious. The chili chicken is out of this world - add some garlic sauce to it and it's the best meal in the city. My husband thinks the biryani is the best he's had in Pittsburgh since India. He had the lamb biryani and there are bones in it just FYI. But for real, garlic sauce and chili chicken. It's amazing."
"3.0","The food was decent but expensive... and they never get my order right. Not a good place for little kids since it's really small but their drinks were great."
"4.0","Great spot for happy hour drinks and a small bite to eat. Located on the third floor of Sienna Mercato, Il Tetto is their rooftop beer garden, equipped with full bar menu and a small menu of appetizers. In the warmer months the entire roof is retractable and opens up to the sky above, making this place so appealing to the masses. The top floor is pretty large but it definitely draws a crowd, especially for happy hour. The menus for all three levels operate entirely separate, with the Meatball Place on the first level and Mezzo, a pizza/pasta/charcuterie restaurant, on the second. All delicious and unique in their own way. Il Tetto always has a great draft selection, some specialty cocktails including some frozen, and a great wine list as well. At all the tables you'll have wait staff earlier in the day and through happy hour as well. Great spot for out of town guests. Only qualm is how annoying it is to get up top, you must take the slowest elevator in existence from first floor to third. There's a back stair case you can use to exit, though."
"5.0","I'd recommend this place for their unique and tasty cocktails! The environment was pretty nice on a beautiful summer evening . The food is okay."
"5.0","Ate breakfast here with my wife during our trip to Pittsburgh.  Great food, great atmosphere, and great service.  I would highly recommend stopping by and trying Cafe Raymond while you're in the Strip District."
"5.0","The best Indian food I have had in America hands down. The flavor is fantastic and tastes truly fresh and homemade. A lot of times Indian restaurants have to make their food too mild to appease the masses, but they don't, and it benefits everybody!"
"5.0","This place is one of the best. Of the two times I've been to Pittsburgh, I've been to Pamela's three times. Can't visit Pittsburgh without coming to Pamela's. This location is nice and small with a pretty cool retro-ish theme going on. The hotcakes are one of the most unique and special items they have. Highly recommended to get at least one hotcake (it's pretty big). Also tried their corned hash which was pretty good but not nearly as special. The location is pretty fun as well especially if you're not from the area since it's on a street with a decent amount of shops to walk around."
"5.0","This is my first time here. My colleague has took us here. There's a express order where in you can order what you want in a tablet and order is processed very soon. Food was really yummy and very tasty. And the price is affordable. It's worth guys. Definitely try this restaurant whenever you're here nearby. Place outside is full of Graffiti."
"5.0","We went to cinderland for drinks without knowing that typically people get dinner here. However, although the selection of the beers was not that wide, we felt very happy with the stout and the guest tap that we got!The chocolate mint vanilla double milk stout was pretty great, but I suggest that you share it because the entire beer is heavy and you might end up not enjoying so much of it. Try also the rest of the selection!"
"4.0","My friend and I came here for Pittsburgh's Restaurant Week and it was one of the best experiences. Very rarely do we go places where they ask you if you want your coat checked. The atmosphere and mood here is somewhat confusing. The lights are dim. The tables are very comfortable and elegant. The staff is amazing. It was quiet when we first arrived, but then it got pretty loud. I don't think we were expecting this noise level, but we adjusted pretty quickly. Our steaks were amazing: his a NY Strip and mine a filet Mignon . The green beans were so fresh and tasty. The cheesecake as small as it was was the perfect size. It wasn't too sweet; I tell you: just right. The service was impeccable. We had multiple people serve us and pass by our table. We will be back for another great meal and vibe for good conversation."
"3.0","Cafe Phipps is just an upscale cafeteria housed inside the conservatory of the same name. When we visited on Saturday, we found that our botanical journey made our bellies growl, so we stopped in afterwards. At the time, they were only serving sandwiches, salads, and soups from their own kitchen along with desserts from Prantl's bakery. I had the Caesar Chicken Wrap and found that it quelled my cravings and little more. The chicken was a little dry, the dressing sparse, but it met my stomach's needs for the moment. Kay had a cup of a Potato-Leek soup and allowed me to have a few spoonfuls. While I was impressed with what I tasted, I felt that some garlic would have made it outstanding. We also got the Triple Threat, which consisted of miniaturized versions of the following pastries: Chocolate Mary Ann, White Chocolate Raspberry Cup, and the legendary Burnt Almond Torte. Stay tuned for a review of Prantl's!"
"5.0","Got to try this restaurant courtesy of Uber eats app. I ordered a BBQ hot dog, The cheesesteak and loaded fries. First thing I inhaled was the Hot dog.  The flavor from how it was cooked was so good i didnt want to put it down. Second thing i tried was half of the cheesesteak. It was tender, juicy and the bread choice was perfect. Last, i tried some of the loaded fries. I wish i had ordered more cheese but the taste was fantastic."
"3.0","I went here last weekend for a late lunch/early dinner type thing.  It was about 430 PM on Saturday and I was visiting my friend Rob's and he has told me for a long time his favorite spot for sushi is Kiku.  I had been in the past, but not since I really developed a palate for sushi.  Anyways, I really didn't want to like this place initially because of its tourist trap location of Station Square across the way from hard rock cafe, hooters and the like.  I was wrong to judge so quickly.  This restaurant basically brought sushi to pittsburgh 25 years ago and I guess they shouldn't be judged for a housing decision made long ago when places like hooters didn't even exist (a glorious time indeed).  You step into this restaurant and its like stepping into a different atmosphere completely.  You are away from the obnoxious interrogation mall lights into a dimly lit soothing atmosphere.  I think the only sound you here is water running from somewhere and the restaurant is intimate while still being private.  There is a small bar and dining room to the immediate left and further in the back there is a sushi bar manned by gents' who look like actual sushi chefs and I was told by one of the staff have over 75 years experience combined between the three.  We sit in the front dining/bar area.  The place is pretty empty due to the early hour, but this is good because it gives us pretty much free reign for Rob and Olga's boy Alex.  The server comes over promptly. She's a young japanese girl with a big and corteous smile.  She offers warm rags and asks if she can bring anything for the boy while we decide.  We start with the sushi lovers platter for two and share it between the three of us.  It's not cheap at about $48.  However, the sushi is quite good.  The rice cooked perfectly with just the right amount of wasabi.  The fish very fresh and sliced well.  They even offer toro on this sampler.  All in all very good sushi, but certainly not the best in Pittsburgh.  I'd say right now the best sushi in Pittsburgh is Umi (you'll pay for it though).  Next the waitress brings some miso soup which is good, but unmemorable.  I was a bit surprised to see they had only one or two choices for sake and almost no wine list to speak of.  We tried some good cold sake.  It was fine, but quite expensive.  I think around $30/bottle for three small pours total.  Rob and I had one each.  Next we tried the 'shobu shobu'.  This is a fondue type way of eating in which they bring over a steaming pot of savory broth along with a side of sliced steak, noodles, tofu, veggies etc. and diners get to cook their own food.  It's a fun way to eat when you are with some other folks on a personal night out.  It'd be good for date night or friends, but I think a little off if it were for a business meeting.  The food itself is fine.  I mean the meat is okay quality the veggies seem fresh and its fun to cook yourself, but probably not a gourmet dining experience.  The cost is $21 per person (minimum of 2 people) fo this dish.  This place deserves kudos for bringing sushi to pittsburgh. It has good sushi and seemingly other good traditional japanese dishes.  My biggest pet peeve with this place is that the cost seems out of line with the location and food.  I didn't pay, but I bet Rob didn't get out of there for less than $200 and we really didn't even drink.  If you find yourself in Station Square you could do a lot worse than this place and you should go here since its a local business and not the mega mcfunsters that seem to invaded this once fun spot."
"5.0","It's high time I update my review because I'm happy to report this place has grown leaps and bounds from when it first opened. I honestly think it is one of the best and inventive cocktail bars in Pittsburgh. Their cocktail menu is super seasonal, and offers up some really great choices. I've always had incredibly made old fashion's. The classics are so great here, I don't stray too often. But what surprised me the most was the improvement of the food! When they first opened, I believe they did not offer food? Then they started promoting their kitchen and got a new chef I was excited about. I tried a couple dishes that were pretty unremarkable. So I hadn't been back in a while for food. I didn't even realize they totally revamped their menu. Listen, I am STILL thinking about those delicious crispy fries. There HAD to be some sort of secret ingredient. I feel like I tasted some vinegar maybe? They were so good! Then I had some brussels sprouts, which were equally crispy and delicious. I can now confidently say I will absolutely be back to eat my way through the menu, with cocktail in hand of course!"
"3.0","I came here for restaurant week with my boyfriend and for that, it was worth it compared to the normal price of the menu. However, overall there was nothing too outstanding about the place and the menu is very overpriced. He got the clam chowder, salmon, accompaniments (green beans and mashed potatoes) and seasonal berries cheesecake dessert off the restaurant menu ($35.18). I got the lobster Mac and cheese ($18) from the regular menu. Portion sizes were decent. We didn't finish the accompaniments and I had to force myself to finish the Mac and cheese. It had a nice crunch from the topping but it seemed to overwhelm the lobster. There was a decent balance between the textures but I wasn't dying to finish it. The chowder was pretty thick while the Mac and cheese was runny. The salmon was nice and tender, my personal favorite from the meal. The green beans and potatoes were pretty bland; I had to add salt to give them flavor. Also adding the green beans to the Mac and cheese helped to counteract the flavor.The service was pretty good. It was our anniversary so they added a complimentary dessert. The waiter came by to check on us a few times and seemed cordial enough. We made a reservation and were seated pretty quickly after arrival. Conclusively I would not come here again, the food was nothing special. I have seen this chain before as well. But it was a nice experience."
"5.0","Great tacos. Nice people. Better options. Their pop is tasty too. Clearly I've never been let down.  Plus they have a great selection of hot sauces, so you can't go wrong with having Taco Tuesdays at this joint."
"5.0","Best Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh hands down. I've eaten at them all over the last twenty years"
"5.0","As we always do whenever we come to Pittsburgh, my family and I stopped in to Bettis Grill. It's our go to spot to eat dinner when we are in town. The food was great, and the service we had from Gabriel was second to none! My water stayed filled even though I was guzzling it like crazy. Never a disappointment when we come here!!! Thanks for the great service Gabriel, it really makes a difference!!"
"4.0","This review is about drinks ONLY.  We did not get their food.When my fiance and I were visiting Pittsburgh recently, we ended up at Redbeard's on Sixth so we could try out their happy hour before we had dinner at nearby Tako.The outside has a bit of a divey appearance.  We were pleasantly surprised by the inside.  The bar was really nice and they had a lot of seating and multiple floors.  They had a really nice drink selection and a lot of tvs  that were showing sports.  It's a perfect place to catch a game.My only complaint with this spot is that the service was painfully slow at times.  Also, we tried to close out but the waitress completely misunderstood us and brought us another round, instead.  We just rolled with it but it took a really long time to get our checks and I ended up having to leave by myself in order to make it to our dinner reservation while my fiance stayed behind to handle the check.  I am hoping the bad service was a one-time thing but the three stars this place has leads me to believe that I might be wrong.  Hopefully they can get that aspect sorted out because otherwise, it is a great place."
"3.0","A completely mediocre meal.I came to Sausalido with my two roommates and was excited for both the Restaurant Week menu and the BYOB option.I started with the baked polenta. This was alright but was essentially a fancied-up mozzarella stick in a block of cheese. It came with some spinach that was incredibly salty. (One of my roommates got the goat-cheese stuffed peppers and said it was actually quite good.)The salad came next. It was overdressed, only ok, and thoroughly forgettable.For the entree, I got the bacon wrapped meatloaf. I think that a home chef who didn't quite know how to make this dish would've made it in the same way. Dry, salty, and nothing interesting about it. One of my roommates got the seafood casserole -- there was no discernible pieces of seafood and just tasted like overcooked, sorta cheesy pieces of pasta (shells?).Even the BYOB was slightly disappointing -- it is listed as 'corkage fee included' for the Restaurant Week menu, but that did not seem to be the case when we went.The best part of the meal was the white bean dip with crostini that was set on the table even before we arrived (slightly weird?).As is, Sausalido, for me, is not worth returning to."
"4.0","I have been here twice and both on business lunches. The first time I filled up on the fantastic canalini (sp?) dipping sauce and fresh bread. The chicken wrap had a spicy mustard that I couldn't stand and ruined the first experience. But I know this is my taste buds' fault and not theirs. I had the beet salad today - holy cow, so good - and the vegetable wrap. I think the wrap would have been good warmed instead of served cold. I plan to go again and hope to go for dinner - the lunch menu is full of great options and a reasonable price, so dinner must be just as great!"
"5.0","This is a restaurant I've loved to go to since I came to Pittsburgh. It's like a chain restaurant but really doesn't have that feel. I think that's what I enjoyed about it as a person who isn't a fan of chains unless it's a regional chain. Try the deep fried hamburger. It's not always on the menu but if it is treat yourself to all the calories. The few times I've been I've had a small wait time but not but so long."
"4.0","Did you hear that?  Oh, yes....the cheesesteaks are calling my name.  Good solid Pittsburgh institution that's friendly and efficient and GOOD!  What more could you ask on a quick run to the Strip on your lunch hour?"
"5.0","This is a must go to place if your in town in Pittsburgh.  They have great food and drinks at a reasonable price.  The award winning Bloody Mary's are awesome.  The lobster bisque is great.Update:  I had a four star rating but the fact the owner himself was walking around bussing tables and then asked me how my meal was, was awesome.  Great experience"
"5.0","In town from New Jersey for a Steelers game.  Looking for a breakfast place.  We randomly parked in front of here and came in.  The food was EXCELLENT but the SERVICE was TOP NOTCH!  Specifically a young lady named Nautia who went above and beyond for every single person who came in this establishment.  If the company I recruited for wasn't 5 hours away I would've tried to recruit her in a heartbeat!!  AMAZING!"
"5.0","The Summit has recently become one of my favorite bars on the Mount. I can't comment on the food, but in regards to atmosphere and drink selections, it's great!They truly offer something for everyone, whether you like wine, beer, or cocktails, there is a wide selection of all of them. My fianc√© loved their Old Fashions, and said it was one of the best he's ever had! Lately I've been feeling sour beers and I was blown away by all of the sour beer options they had - it was its own section of the menu! I also love that The Summit has a bunch of games to play and actually no TVs on the walls. I feel like this gives everyone the opportunity to hang out, have fun, and enjoy each others' company without distractions. While the pricing is a little more expensive than some of the other bars on Mount Washington, it is also just a 'classier' vibe, and you get what you pay for. They do offer a happy hour from 5-7 on weekdays, too."
"5.0","It's no secret in my Yelp reviews that I LOVE tacos, so when I had been hearing my friends rave about this place for weeks, I knew I had to check it out.  My roommate and I ventured down Carson Street and entered the quaint, colorful restaurant.  A handful of seats are at the cement bar surrounding the taco prep area, and a few more at the window counter.  I was surprised that it wasn't busy, but glad that we were able to grab seats.  I will be honest, I wasn't impressed with the service right off the bat, as it took the two employees working about 5 minutes to even acknowledge that we were standing there.  They were working on putting together a couple of orders, but a nod or 'hello' to acknowledge our presence and impending orders would've been nice.  The gal working finally found a second to take our orders: 3 tacos for me (pork, chicken, and Americano), and 1 taco (pork) and an order of black beans for my roommate.The tacos came out in a jif, on warm, corn tortillas as requested.  These tacos are the perfect size and good LORD are they delicious.  My favorites, in order, would be the chicken, Americano and pork.  The pork was good, although the slaw that comes on it isn't something I'm a fan of... I'm just not a slaw fan in general so I won't hold that against them.Doce also offers a cooler full of fun drinks to wash your meal down with, for $2 a pop.  When the check came, I was shocked.  $18. That's it? Should I order more tacos? I mean, EIGHTEEN BUCKS for four tacos, an order of black beans, and two drinks?  I did the math in my head and it checked out.  At $3 a taco, Doce has an advantage over one of my other taco faves in the city, and the location is prime.  I will absolutely be back to this place again and again.  They offer takeout as well!"
"5.0","Excellent lunch spot! I got the Arepa Pabellon and a ground beef empanada. Both were incredible and so filling- do NOT let the size fool you. It's more food than you think! With Venezuelan spots few and far between in the Pittsburgh area, I am so happy this is right near my office!"
"5.0","Simple menu, delicious food! My favorite is the Americano on flour. But I suggest trying everything across the board. Walking tacos are unique, fun, and good too."
"3.0","Inside decor was cool and the rooftop is pretty neat. The food was just ok. Wasn't too impressed with flavors and the prices seemed steeped for what you pay for. Tried charcuterie board but seemed skimpy for $24. Not horrible but not the best. Had the margherita pizza and it overall lacked in flavor. I think mainly because of the sauce."
"5.0","Food was amazing! Parking was free and convenient! Well done and very much enjoyed. The egg drop soup is the best. House special crispy spicy chicken was amazing"
"5.0","4.5/5. Best pancakes I've ever had. Service was great and the wait was nonexistent when we went. Wasn't a huge fan of the turkey sausage, but my dining partner said the normal sausage was fantastic. I had the banana chocolate and it was amazing! Will always be a Pittsburgh favorite."
"5.0","I love this place, I tried it for the first time yesterday and wasn't disappointed. I ordered a full chicken parm sub and it was fantastic, probably enough for 3 meals but I ate it in 2. I'll certainly order from them again"
"5.0","Love this place! Moved to the neighborhood several months ago and this quickly became my go-to pizza place. I love love love the steak rolls, I have actually never seen a dish like this before. Totally delicious and a great value. Italian donuts are also great!"
"4.0","My husband and I had been wanting to try Tamarind for years - literally! - and were so excited to finally check out the restaurant on Sunday. Service was quick from being seated to bringing the check. Lunch buffet was our only option, and it was a great introduction to the restaurant. I enjoyed all the dishes that I tried. My husband would normally order his food with an above average spice level while I would order a spice level 1 or 2, so I was very pleased that Tamarind's buffet pleased us both. We were both shocked when the bill arrived... I believe the total was about $20? We'll definitely be back soon!!"
"5.0","Caffe Mona is one of cutest spots in Pittsburgh! Perfect spot for brunch. BYOB for brunch was so fun. The Farmer's crepe with chicken, mozzarella, fresh tomatoes, and pesto was delicious! It was accompanied by a side salad. So refreshing! The owner was super friendly! Lastly, the cream puffs melted in your mouth."
"5.0","I popped into this restaurant after being overwhelmed with all the options on the strip. Best coincidence. Every option on their menu looked delicious and my meal was just that. Not to mention, it was SO affordable compared to other restaurants. Great food. Great price."
"4.0","What a great place to eat. Loved the wings. Very friendly staff and always attentive. Price were good and great selection of food."
"3.0","Great place to visit of you're a Steelers fan! awesome vibe from all the people, wouldn't recommend the food.  I tried the fried cheeseburger, mainly because i wanted to know what a fried cheeseburger would taste like, and you guessed it, wasn't that great.  Would recommend just visiting this place for beer and appetizers and getting dinner else where."
"5.0","Amazing amazing food. Been 5 weeks in a row, continuously coming here for Sunday lunch. Addicted to their Cheese steak on Naan with lamb - so scrumptious that I can eat it every single day."
"4.0","Elevator Review: Good fresh food in a large portion at a reasonable price. Give yourself a few extra minutes. I was really excited when they announced Freshii was opening in downtown. This type of restaurant is the perfect addition to the ever-expanding list of downtown lunch options. I ordered the Pangoa bowl with chicken. The ingredients were fresh and the overall bowl looked fantastic - really colorful and inviting. The composition of the bowl felt a bit off - a higher ratio of corn and black beans vs avocado and chicken, but it still tasted great. And overall the portion felt quite large - I didn't actually finish the whole thing. The process felt a bit longer than I expected - both the wait in line and waiting once I ordered. But the staff was super friendly (the owner was actually chatting with folks as they waited in line), so I chalk some of the wait to the fact that its a new restaurant that is finding its groove. I want to go back soon for breakfast and to try some other options. If you want a healthy, fresh option for lunch in downtown give it a shot."
"4.0","This place is my shit. Midday is the best time to go and every time I do, its fresh and tastes awesome. The staff is friendly and works quickly. They have a simple menu and they allow for edits and substitutions to your order which is nice. One suggestion would be to add a fish taco as a possible choice. Its almost perfect. Minus one star because the only drinks they have are bottled in a mini fridge which is a lot more annoying than you'd think when trying to have an inexpensive meal."
"5.0","I am so glad I checked this place out!  My faith in Pittsburgh's ethnic food restaurants has been restored and I'm not even kidding.  I hate always bringing up the fact that I'm from the West Coast and I've had good ethnic food, but it's such a bummer when I try to eat out in Pittsburgh and I'm so disappointed.  Luckily it did not happen this time.  First off, the decor and ambiance were great.  The restaurant was clean, well-lit, non-pretentious and even had cloth napkins!  The menu was extensive and they had plenty of vegetarian options.  My friend and I ordered the tofu spring rolls as an appetizer.  They were very tasty and fresh.  For dinner we ordered a couple of curries and we weren't disappointed.  The sauces were creamy, slightly sweet, slightly spicy and totally delicious.  The portions are HUGE and we both ate way too much.  We had no complaints about the service either.  Overall, I would recommend this place to everyone...even my fellow West Coast emigrants.  Come here with an appetite because you'll need it!"
"4.0","My wife and I biked here from Millvale on a Sunday afternoon. I have been to Peppis a few years ago and finding a coupon in the enjoy book for a bogo was plenty of incentive to go back. My wife and I each had the Italian sub and a side of large fries. I love that they do fresh cut fries here. Ours came out hot and in need of a little salt which was available on the table. The sandwiches are huge and we both pigged out and ate it all. The sub is a good balance of salty lunch meat, bread, toppings, and dressing. The price is extremely reasonable as well.I didn't realize how much I missed this place. Will need to go back again sometime soon!"
"1.0","No seating. Reserve tables for an hour before and won't seat anyone who is actually present. Don't bother. Hostess has rbf."
"5.0","For my husband and me, this is the go-to place in Pittsburgh. It's a great mom and pop feel. The staff are super friendly-- I can't say that enough. We feel so welcome any time we walk in.  The portions are large, and we always take half of it home. I usually stay around a 3 on the spicy-scale though. There are a lot of good restaurants in Pittsburgh, but if I had to pick a favorite, this would be it."
"4.0","I really like the atmosphere of Mezzo. I came here for an early dinner last night and since it was warm, the large windows were open. I ordered fried zucchini and an arugula salad; both of which were pretty good. The chefs have a strict policy of no substitutions so I was told that I could not order my salad and add chicken for a protein. I still enjoyed my experience."
"5.0","If you're looking for great food or coffee, this is the place to go. With a street side window, a cozy interior, and a beautiful secluded patio out back, it's the perfect place whether you're on the go, or in the mood for a nice sit down meal.They have a great selection of crepes, omelettes, French toast, and bagels (and everything that we saw and tried was generously portioned). We tried the monte cristo french toast  and the mocha french toast and shared the Nutella and banana crepe to finish. Everything was delicious, and fairly priced. Etto, the owner, even came by to introduce himself and chat for a while, making our experience even more enjoyable.Overall, we had a great time and definitely plan on going back."
"2.0","Everything went fine- but Literally asked what the deal was, they said 'corona are $3'. I had 3 with my girlfriend and they charged me $5+ each.   They took the opportunity to rip me off."
"4.0","Update: i have really come around to the pizza. The trick is that you need to eat it hot right out of the oven right in the store. It turns out to be a great place to walk to with my son. We get a little pizza. Kill it together and walk home. Sentimental value is increasing. AND THEY ARE STARTING 6 PACKS OF PICK YOUR OWN. our new go to for beer. Hoepfully they will expand it. But good smaller breweries so far. So.... i added another star.Old thoughts: Taste like College pizza- not good, not horrible gross, just boring pizza.  I will say they do a lot of fun types of pizza, but we live close to too many really really exceptional good pizzas to waste too much money here.  THE THREE STARS: for a very good Italian sub and over all low prices.  Its hard to have pizza as much as I would want it, but I would hit them up for subs ANYTIME. VERY GOOD.  Baked fresh."
"4.0","I'm so excited that Freshii finally opened! It's a great alternative for anyone who is looking for a healthier lunch option outside of the typical fast food joints. You can choose from their signature salads, bowls, and wraps or build your own if you want something more customized.I ordered the market salad with tofu which was amazing. I would definitely recommend. All protein comes with an upcharge of a few dollars. All the ingredients are fresh and high quality. I'm obsessed with the honey dijon dressing. Portion sizes are reasonable, but I was hungry again soon after. The only downside is that their hours are very limited. They're only open until 5pm on weekdays and closed on weekends."
"4.0","Very good food. We are here for dinner. And both of us ordered lamb entree, lamb curry and lamb tandoori. They are fantastic. But I don't like the desserts because they are too sweet for me."
"5.0","If you're looking for a great spot to dine while in the Strip District, this place is awesome.  I got the Steel City Lobster Roll and it doesn't disappoint! The lobster is perfectly cooked and they smother it with lobster bisque. Also- ask for the Bloody Mary menu.  Best Bloody Mary I have had for a while- made with their homemade mix and you can add a fried soft shell crab or candied bacon.  Service was exceptional!"
"4.0","Today's special, Rachel turkey wrap. Made w real juicy roasted turkey, slaw, and a very flavorful 'Russian sauce.'"
"1.0","Terrible service and just okay pizza. What a nice atmosphere and location to unfortunately have this restaurant have it. Not going back."
"4.0","Decent Japanese food. We ordered the Robatayaki, a kind of Japanese barbecue, including Pork belly (tender, juicy, 5 star), Wagyu beef tenderloin (okay, well-seasoned, 4 start) and Bacon quail egg (Very curious about how they wrapped eeg yolk in the bacon, delicious combination, 5 star.) Three pieces one serving. We also had sashimi rice bowl (chirashi). The sashimi were very fresh, clean and delicious. Okonomiyaki (pancake) and temaki sushi were mediocre compared to other dishes. There are better options here.  Service: Open kitchen, you can see the work of the sushi chef. The environment and the service are also very good. Tips: 4:30 - 6 weekdays are happy hour. You can have sake and some appetizers at really good price. And better make reservations. This place could be really busy."
"3.0","Sausalido has the potential to be an amazing restaurant, or go out of business.The service was wonderful. Every person working at the restaurant was thoughtful, attentive, and flexible. The decor, cleanliness, and location were also all really good. Unfortunately, my main hesitations with this restaurant were some of the food items. My favorite thing was a fried cheese appetizer and my side of smashed/mashed potatoes. The cheese was amazing and devoured immediately, but we also ordered other appetizers including the Brussels sprouts and potatoes. For entrees our table had steak, crab cakes, and tuna. All of these food items were mediocre. They tasted okay and were generally eaten, but I wasn't too impressed. Most of the leftover food was left on the table. I really want this place to do well and improve, but the restaurant was almost empty when we were there and I'm concerned it will eventually close down, even though I feel like it has a lot of potential.  I heard they have a good deal for two entrees during the week, but as of now I don't have any strong urges to go back."
"4.0","We walked in and seated ourselves. Looked like they had a walk-up counter from which you could order from the outside. Unfortunately the back patio was closed at the time so we settled for a high top table. The interior was decorated with large eclectic art pieces and empty picture frames.My friend and I ordered two coffees and two crepe entrees for under $25. We split one savory and one sweet, the Polish hill and the Nutella banana. Food came out with minimal wait. Presentation was great and the crepes were absolutely delicious! Very fulfilling. Good portions and an even better price."
"3.0","This place makes the prettiest bloody marys i have ever seen. You can get the regular one, but who wants to be regular? You want to get the add-ons - like bacon and shrimp. The actual drink itself wasn't amazing - could have used more alcohol. But the presentation overall (we saw a couple drinking it outside) was enough to get rope us in.Tip - check in on Yelp and you can get a free appetizer with any menu item order. Since we had already eaten, we didn't really want appetizers, except maybe some oysters. The waiter was nice enough to let us use the Yelp offer as $12 off the bill. The oysters were tiny and not completely shucked clean - but hey at $12 off, how can I complain?"
"5.0","Came here for their soft opening, friends and family night. Great beer and burgers! I'm friends with the master brewer and his beer is awesome."
"2.0","I went here on a Saturday night with a few friends.  They had  a DJ so there was a cover of $3 - boo!  I'm really adverse to covers unless there's something really great going on and considering I had never been in this place before, I was taking a chance.  For those that know me, I'm not the gambling kind.  But I thought ok it's just $3 so it's not like I'd be going broke.  The music was fairly loud which made it difficult to talk and no one was dancing.  It wasn't overly crowded which made it easy to get drinks.  Am I glad I checked this place out - sure, but have I been to better dance clubs/bars - yes.  If you're in the area and looking for something to do, then check it out, but I wouldn't make a special trip to go here."
"4.0","This location even though it is usually very busy, the staff is friendly and fast. I visit this location at least three times a week and usually my experience for bagel breakfast or pick two lunch is very good . Just a few times , mainly in the weekends I have come across some not well baked bagels ."
"3.0","I really wanted to love this place because of the good reviews and how kind the staff was, but unfortunately I did not. The coffee was good, but the food was pretty disappointing. Both dishes were cold and had very mediocre flavor. I'd go back for coffee & pastries but likely not for a larger meal. There's paid street parking or limited time free street parking in the surrounding area."
"2.0","If u just want a quick pizza this place is decent... If you want to enjoy your pizza look elsewhere. The changed something with the cheese and sauce and now it tastes terrible... Tastes old, bland and the dough is thin and burnt... Wings re good though"
"4.0","A very welcoming and casual environment at this small cafe to enjoy delicious breakfast, lunch, (and possibly dinner in the future!). I saw one of the sandwiches posted here and wanted it so badly that I dropped in on a slow afternoon just so I could try it. I'm pleased to say that I was not let down, but I think a few suggestions could really boost it from great to out of this world.- When I walked in, I was greeted by the most friendly and welcoming receptionist I've ever met. I basically described to her that I wanted whatever I saw online with little-to-none descriptions, and she reassured me that the kitchen could whip up whatever it was I wanted, which I'm so pleased that they did because who else serves gourmet breakfast sandwiches at 2PM on a Monday?- The sandiwch had a runny sunny side up egg, sauteed onions and red bell peppers, and a shaving of cheese. To say that the bread was amazing is an understatement. Overall a very delicious sandwich; however, a few bites had only egg. I think a more generous serving of the vegetables would have really elevated the sandwich so that every bite would capture all the flavors that this sandwich has to offer."
"4.0","I've always been a big fan of brunch and so far I've been content with my dining experiences at Pamela's. The 'morning after breakfast special' on the menu is the one they really try to sell. Make sure you change the regular hotcakes to the specialty ones! Definitely worth the extra $2. I highly recommend the chocolate chip banana hotcake. Also go to the shadyside Pamela's if you can. It's better than the one in Oakland."
"5.0","So good!Best lunch in the city, and crazy affordable. Be sure to try the plantains!"
"5.0","The workers at Caffe Mona La Bistro brought a little sunshine to a terrifying week. My son had a bone cyst and broke his femur so we were staying at Children's Hospital. My husband went to grab us something different than the cafeteria food. He place his order and the cashier asked (after noticing my husband's hospital visitor badge) if he had a child in the hospital. When my husband told him what was happening, he made a delicious dessert for our son. It was perfect, a Nutella and banana crepe. My sandwich was incredible too. The grilled chicken and pesto sandwich. I'm so glad we went there and on our frequent follow up visits, we will go back any chance we get. Bravo to you and your employees! Your kindness was appreciated more than words can say."
"3.0","The office ordered several hoagies and a stromboli. Everything got here fast, hot and fresh. The prices are average, half hoagies for about 6 bucks. Whole hoagies for 10 bucks.The bread was great. All the bread in Pittsburgh is great (or at least most of it). Large, crispy, crunchy, fragile, toasty bread. The only complaint was it was corn dusted on the bottom. This makes for messy fingertips and a messy desk.I got a steak hoagie. Four thick slices of steak and tons of browned, bubbly cheese. Very tasty. Unfortunately, they do serve their steaks Pittsburgh style....covered in lettuce and tomatoes. No biggy, I got mine without. The onions were crisp, fresh red onions. I would have prefered sauteed onions on a steak but its no big deal. They did charge me a buck for the bannana peppers, even though I left the more expensive tomatoes of my hoagie. And it appeared that they let Peter North put the mayonnaise on it, it was pretty much coated in the stuff.Tasty hoagie though. If they would have limited the mayonnaise to a reasonable level, it would have been perfect.Everyone else was more than pleased with their food. Fast delivery, too, even for a Saturday night."
"5.0","I had been wanting to give this place a try and hadn't done so until two weeks ago, but it was one of the best dining experiences we've ever had. Stopping in for a late lunch, the place had a nice vibe going for it and we were seated near the open air area, so lucky it was a nice day out.I ordered the calamari and my companion ordered lobster bisque fries. Service was very prompt, even though the place seemed moderately busy. After getting our orders, we split them, and rather happily since the lobster bisque fries was a heaping portion. My calamari was good and there was enough for us to share without issue. We did both get plenty of lobster chunks out of the lobster bisque fries, so that was a pleasant surprise, since I was worried we would be short changed with maybe one or two little pieces. We actually both got several good sized chunks of lobster in the fries.Overall, this was a very good experience that we both enjoyed."
"4.0","Amazing tacos. Interior is tight but the food is always great.  Not a place to sit down to eat and linger.  Think street food in a store front and you'll fall in love. Serve is somewhat fast despite the place always being slammed with orders. The menu has staples but at the same time there is almost always something innovating simmering to be served up for the day."
"5.0","amazing. the food was delicious & satisfied all of our hungry teenagers + wowed the adult staff. besides that, the service was so kind. chef melissa barth took the time to handle unique orders from our whole crew, explain the menu and ingredients, and make sure we got everything we ordered. we're not from here, but if we roll through town, we'll definitely be back."
"4.0","Always get the cheese pizza, breadsticks and mozz sticks. Always good. The breadsticks might be my favorite in the city when they're seasoned properly. It's a hit or miss but for what it is and the price, gets the job done!"
"5.0","The absolute best place in Pittsburgh.  The food is spectacular and variety incredible, the grocery selection amazing (anything from mommas kitchen, you know you'll find there), and everyone who works here is kind and treat people like family.  What can I say, Salem's makes Pittsburgh feel like home."
"2.0","Great idea - terrible execution. I came here per a coworker's suggestion earlier this month and found that while the space is lovely and the food tasty, the service was too horrendous to ignore.One of the biggest drawbacks of Il Tetto is in the extended name - the rooftop garden. Don't get me wrong: if it's a beautiful day outside, this place strikes me as a great setting for a drink. Unfortunately we live in Pittsburgh and the common threat of rain meant that the garden went from open to covered during my visit. The noise level tripled and the temperature climbed when it did, making the place almost unbearable. I stuck it out because I was really enjoying my drink and the food with my company. Their Pimms Cup cocktail includes fruit flavoring and ginger beer, not the usual combination in this drink. Their chocolate hazelnut marjolaine dessert was amazing, and both the spinach and buffalo chicken dips were fantastic.Unfortunately, getting the food in particular turned into quite the challenge. Our table's waitress more or less ignored me after I placed my first drink order. My coworkers and I had to shout after her at one point because she would walk off before we had a chance to ask her for food or drink refills. Not once did my water get refilled during my visit, by the way. Fortunately I had a Pepsi in my bag to help combat both the room's temperature and the heat in the buffalo chicken dip.The final nail in the roof garden's coffin was when I asked for my check. I figured things were moving slowly so I would ask for it early. Boy was my prediction spot on. I waited at least 30 minutes for my check (I didn't start a countdown until after I had been waiting some amount of time, so I only know it was more than 30 minutes). I even watched people who asked for their checks after me get theirs before I did. Oh, and I only got my check because I told a passing server how long I had been waiting.I expect that I'll check out the other parts of Sienna Mercato in the future, but the rooftop garden did not impress me. Yes, the food and drinks were great. The place is probably lovely enough to visit when the place is open (although I suspect it's covered more often than not). But after that horrendous service I don't plan on returning."
"5.0","If you love tacos go here. They are amazing and the people are super nice there. I literally eat here no less than twice a week."
"4.0","There was about a 15-20 minute wait to get a table, which was not too bad. The service was prompt, after ordering the breakfast if came in about 5 minutes! We had the famous hotcakes, since almost all the reviews were mentioning them. I had the banana-walnut hotcakes and my daughter the chocolate chip hotcakes. Both were decadently delicious, and a great finish to our Pittsburgh trip!"
"3.0","I had really high expectations from the look and atmosphere of the cafe. It has a great location and a great-looking interior. The food isn't 'bad' by any means, but it's not a wrap or salad I can justify paying $10+ for at lunch. I'm all about paying more for fresh, high quality ingredients, but I feel like I get the same quality at Au Bon Pain for a bit cheaper and a wider variety of options."
"4.0","The Capital Grille is a steakhouse with superb service, a great wine list and excellent food.  I've eaten there about 3 times and have experienced wonderful food and extraordinary service.  The decor is very gentleman's club and over the top masculine.  I particularly like the Lobster Mac 'n' Cheese, which is gourmet comfort food.  Their wine list is heavy on the reds, and their strength is American wines.  I believe they have an extensive collection of over 2,000 bottles.  But honestly, people go here to impress a business client, or for a special occasion.  It's a great place to go if you are not picking up the tab and you want to feel pampered.  The menu is more diverse than both Ruth Chris and Mortons, when it comes to the food, I think the Capital Grille far outshines the competition. The Sommelier is well trained and knows a lot about food pairings and making wine recommendations.   So overall, the Capital Grille is expensive, but at the same time high quality, and is always my first choice when recommending a steak house."
"2.0","Not really sure what the fuss is all about here but we left before we could get into the food process. We came here at normal dinner time hours because the reviews looked great. We walked into a restaurant that had two people in it. Not a good sign around dinner time. The 'sushi bar' is about 6 feet wide and looks like it was an afterthought. This place is clearly a bar. The restaurant had TVs all over the place and the actual bar was almost the length of the restaurant. Clearly their focus. After we decided, based on observation, to not eat here we decided to have a drink while we looked for our next spot. My drink was not good. Poor flavor and no alcohol at all. I took two sips just to be sure and I was done. Fair enough that we didn't eat here but after some observations we decided to skip it. Maybe we missed something but our experience wasn't good."
"1.0","I went around 9:30 PM on sunday night. I ordered a Bisibelebath, my two other friends order idly and Uthappam.The idly came after about 5 mins, but the bisibelebath and uthappam came only after 30 minutes. The uthappam was not fully cooked. We returned and he gave a mysore dosa instead. The bisibelebath, is supposed to come with 2 papads. Two papdads were given about 10 minutes after the entree. It was too oily, so I asked for a different pair. He took it back and came back after 10 more minutes with one papad, with the same amount of oil on it. I did not pay any tip in the end. Duh!"
"5.0","Sat the bar, got okonomiyaki (pancake), bottle of dreamy clouds saki, and Budweiser. I was surprised at how hearty this pancake was, made of fish, cabbage, bacon and grilled. And a very large portion that only costs $10. Will try the whole grilled fish and whole squid next time."
"4.0","I walked over to Pamela's for take out breakfast while I waited for my friends to pick me up for our friend's wedding.I decided to get the breakfast special -- sausage, scrambled eggs, and regular hotcakes. I waited only 15 minutes for my order and I overheard one of the managers say that Pamela's was featured in People's magazine. Not sure if it was in a past, latest, or  future issue, but it made me look forward to breakfast even more and I definitely thought it lived up to the hype. I quickly gambled up the sausage and scrambled eggs, but those hotcakes were AWESOME! They were thin like crepes and with butter and syrup, it was drool worthy. On my first bite I literally said, 'Hmmm...' With the breakfast special, if you pay an extra $2, you can get one a stack of the specialty hotcakes (blueberry, chocolate chip, strawberry, or banana walnut).The only downside of this place is that it is cash only."
"2.0","Went here to get a few coffees and use the bathroom. Was told I couldn't use the bathroom by spending $7 on two coffees, but I could use the bathroom by purchasing a $4 pastry. Obviously, this makes no sense - but I guess you don't count as a customer at Cafe Raymond if you're just buying coffee. Disappointing experience with just okay coffee."
"5.0","We had the best time here this past Easter.  We decided to take a vacation from the holiday and just do our own thing.  So after church we went to brunch then began to look for a place that was local that had some great beers and was actually open.  A phone call later and we were headed to Cinderlands.To my surprise they also serve a brunch and it looked pretty good, but we were there for a few libations.  This was our 4th time to this brewery.  On our first visit, which was the day after Christmas, and maybe a month after they opened, we had a fabulous time.  I tried almost all of their drafts that day and seriously loved them all.  Plus we were there in the middle of the week so the place was not busy and we had plenty of room.  On subsequent visits we have run into mass crowds and not such a comfortable atmosphere, but this last visit ranks up there with our first.There were no seats available at the bar, which is usually our go-to spot, but in the back there were several booths available.  This was nice in a few ways.  One I was never back there before and it is so cutely decorated, and two it was away from the door so we didn't have to deal with the blast of cold air every time someone entered or exited.Our server was a very nice and attentive young lady who didn't even seem to mind working the holiday.  They had a NE IPA on tap named, Type-Two Fun.  We have been on an NE IPA kick for months now!  Their take on the brew was excellent.  Great full body, golden cloudy color, with gentle bitterness and light tones of orange.  Delicious and growler worthy!  But we didn't have a growler so we settled for a few pints.  We spent the rest of the afternoon people watching, summer planning, and just kicking it while soaking in this lovely space and tasty drinks.  Thank you for a pleasant Easter afternoon Cinderlands."
"5.0","Delicious. Friendly service, great food & drinks, and clean! Highly recommend. High corkage fee so we just bought their drinks."
"5.0","Had lunch here twice and tried different burgers which were very good.  Got the brownbag special with comes with a can soda and pasta salad (excellent)."
"5.0","This is a great spot for drinks in the city! Awesome views, and a great drink selection. It is super nice in the summer, but it is open all year round! I think they have a limited appetizer menu, but I have only been there to drink. I will say the hours are limited and vary in the colder months, and I have found myself disappointed because it's closed."
"5.0","I've been wanted to try this place since I came to Pittsburgh, but somehow just never get to it. Me and my boyfriend came here last week because he got a coupon. Wow. Just wow. I love everything I ordered. Everything is flavored to perfection. We ordered garlic naan for appetizer, and I ordered chicken Saag for entree. Man, I wish Naan is free or cheaper but they're so good, I could not Not get them. And let me tell you about Saag. It's now my official favorite Indian food. I'm obsessed. I actually packed my little tiny bit of leftover sauce to go just so I can taste more of these the day after. Our waiter was very attentive and helpful as well. I cannot have a better experience. We barely waited for our food too, soo happy we came.I would definitely come back again especially as it being so close to our work place."
"5.0","The best place for eating Japanese food, my favorite is Okonomiyaki, it tastes Japanese. And mashroom was also pretty good, softly."
"1.0","Ew is the best word to describe this place.  I don't know why pizza places offer pasta if they can't do it right.  I ordered the fetticine alfredo and it tasted like a frozed michelina dinner.  Noodles stuck together, incredibly overcooked, and the sauce was like something straight out of a ragu can.  Husband ordered a gyro and it was incredibly greasy and tasted like reheated frozen gyro meat.  Nothing we ordered tasted fresh and definitely not worth the money.  Stay away!!"
"3.0","A good, reasonably prices Italian restaurant in Bloomfield. We went on Halloween around 7pm and found that is the absolute best time to go out to eat! It was completely empty except for two other parties. They bring you bread and oil to the table. We also ordered bruschetta which was very good. Everyone seemed very happy with their meals. Beware of the pasta Diablo! My dad was sweating from the heat of it and he normally loves spicy food. He said it was delicious, but it sounds like a great dish for someone prepared for some serious spice (not me!). My little brother was disappointed that his spaghetti and meatballs came with one meatball, but besides that we were very happy with the meal. Nice portions and great service."
"5.0","Traveling in the area, we looked to Yelp of course for a suggestion. Yelp, you did good for this restaurant!We had the egg rolls (fried spring roll), chicken satay and Tom Kar soup as appetizers. I have to say the soup was wonderful! Have to agree with Amy H, the pad thai is now a front runner for my favorites. The portion was very large, so definitely go family style next time to share  among the group.Definitely going to return when I'm back in town. Yummy!"
"4.0","I enjoy this place. Would recommend getting the Chicken Vindaloo myself,  but you can't go wrong with the curry either. Their bread is amazing and so is their appetizer crackers and sauce. Beer selection has some funky brews worth trying.Buffet should be avoided, it sacrifices the quality of what you could be getting off the menu. Would go back and do recommend to others."
"3.0","Just stopped by to satisfy late night hunger pangs. Can be a lil difficult to spot at first, just look for Japanese writing. If you're in a wheelchair or have mobility issues, you have to climb 3 steep flights of stairs to get to the place. It's chic and trendy inside. My server, Kairo, was very nice.Miso deviled eggs- ok. Normal deviled eggs with just a  bit more bite to them.Spicy tuna sushi cone - ummm, SPICY. Jesus, it's SPICY. Didn't really taste like tuna to me bit then again, it was hard to taste anything but my burning taste buds. I can't recommend this."
"5.0","I had a business meeting that I had to make happen on Monday morning.  The person I was meeting suggested Arnold's Tea.Not knowing what to expect, I got there early.  What a gem!  The place is absolutely beautiful.  The space was much larger than I had expected, and with all the beautiful woodwork, it was just beautiful.I am a chai tea drinker - and was happy to find all kinds of flavors - vanilla, masala, chocolate...and a few others.  I went with vanilla (and was happy to find it was decaf!).  it was phenomenal!   I don't typically drink every ounce, but i couldn't wait to drink every ounce, it was so good!The space has free wifi to use that worked beautifully.  The staff is friendly and helpful.    Be aware - they don't accept tips.  I would go here 100 times over before I hit up a chain!  Definitely check it out!"
"3.0","Thai Gourmet's food is just 'pretty good,' but I keep going back because I like the meal experience there; it's the only Thai place I know of where you can eat at a counter and they keep Christmas lights in the windows all year. Because it's in a narrow row house and decorated like your great aunt's living room (assuming she's the kind of woman who loves wood paneling and house plants), the ambiance is unpretentious in the best way possible. Standard Thai dishes like pad thai, green curry, larb and pad kee mow are solid, but other classics that should be equally solid, such as salad rolls, tom kha gai soup and panang curry always leave me wanting more spice, depth and--I hate to trot out the most clich√©d foodie term ever, but--complexity of flavor. Thai ice tea, contrary to popular belief, can be done wrong if it's wwwaaaayyyyy too bitter or wwwaaaayyyyy too sweet, but these guys whip it up good.I also like to play menu adventures here: this is the game where I ask the server (one of the owner's daughters) what's good and then pick whatever sounds most crazy. It's been awesome at helping be break out of my Thai food rut, which previously consisted exclusively of fish cakes, papaya salad and panang curry."
"5.0","For a special evening out I made reservations at the capital grill as it was a close walk to the Venus for out after dinner plans.  I was not disappointed at all.  Everything from the wait staff to the food was excellent.  I got the 10 oz filet and it was good but I honestly enjoyed some of the other items I ordered more.  The white cheddar potato soup was such a comfort like soup.  I wish I could have that allllll the time.  We also got the Brussels sprouts as a side and they were outstanding.  It is pricey for the average person so there is no way I could afford to go often but for the 'special occasions' I will return for sure."
"5.0","3rd time here and absolutely love it. George is the best waiter very accommodating very nice and we come from Delaware and always ask for George! Food is amazing too!"
"5.0","We've been to Bettis' before and loved it, but we had an especially memorable time this past weekend. I planned a surprise 30th birthday party for my boyfriend and invited 40 people. Bettis' was my first choice for the party location since I have had such great experiences there before. Bettis' was accommodating from the moment I started planning the party in May 2018. Dayna was extremely responsive and made sure everything was exactly the way I had envisioned it to be. The hosts and waiters were also fantastic and made sure everyone was well taken care of. We couldn't have asked for a more accommodating venue or better service for the party. We will continue to be regular customer and recommend Bettis' to others in the future!"
"5.0","Doce is awesome. It's $3 street tacos that are delicious. What else do you need? They're open super late, service is fast. Ska and punk tunes all day long. If you know what an amazing $3 taco tastes like you'll love this place. If you're expecting sit-down restaurant food there are plenty of other options but you'll regret not going here. Doce is a Southside staple."
"2.0","Greasy and disgusting.  One of the worst meals I've ever suffered through.  It was literally dripping with frier oil"
"4.0","If you want a quick and good hearty taco, this is definitely the place to go.* Food: I ordered their Korean BBQ special and a chicken taco. I would say the Korean special was a tad bit salty but it was still delicious. The chicken one was probably my favorite. They put avocado in it and it definitely brought all the ingredients together. * Cost vs Worth: Their tacos are around $4 each and it honestly cannot get better than that. Will I come here again? - Yes!!!!"
"5.0","Fantastic service & a delicious menu!My friend & I shared a brie, chicken, apple, & avocado crepe + an order of vanilla berry french toast. Both meals were absolutely wonderful. The staff is incredibly accommodating and genuinely kind.This place is truly a hidden gem & I look forward to sharing it with more friends!"
"5.0","By far some of the best tacos I have had hands down the best in the city!!!! Way better than Steel Cactus"
"4.0","Prince of India is by far the most convenient option for a Pitt student that needs to satiate their Indian food cravings. I have been here many a time, with decent experiences. My most recent experience definitely made me want to write a review because I had such an attentive server. I ordered the lentil daal in an attempt to try something new (I usually order mattar paneer or saag), with the spiciest spice level they could do. That's usually what I tell them, too, because if I say 10, they'll give me 'white girl 10', which is still too mild for my taste.When the lentil daal came out, it was still not hot enough! I don't know if it was the texture of the lentils or the flavors in the dish, but I was regretting not ordering my usual. However, I guess the waiter picked up that it wasn't spicy enough. He said, 'How is the spice level?' and I said, 'Still not hot enough, but that's okay!' However he wasn't going to take that as an answer. He took my dish and brought back a hotter dish. The spice level was much more to my liking, and I am very thankful for his attentiveness. Aside from the daal, the naan was not nearly as fluffy and soft as it usually is. I would venture to guess there was too much flour in the dough, but it was inconsistent with my previous experiences eating Prince of India's naan, which is almost always light and fluffy. All in all, I will definitely be going back to Prince of India. Mostly due to convenience.Tip: order an individual dish, don't go for the buffet. It always tastes less delicious than the entrees."
"3.0","Friendly service, good sports bar TV coverage, all you can eat wings on Wednesdays that even a dieter could not resist, other food was pretty good as well but give it some time to get to four and more stars."
"5.0","Arnold's is the best.  The tea is great, the service is awesome - the cashier always remembers me and my usual order. The smoothies are delicious. It's a great place to stop and read on the couch or grab a cup to go. Highly recommend the chocolate chai - hot or cold!"
"5.0","So, I came back for dinner and more drinks. Loved it. The cocktail list is wonderful and our server really took the time to help us figure out something we'd like. I got the tacos, and I'm happy I did. They paired perfectly with a cocktail that contained the salsa verde used on the tacos!  So if that isn't a match made in heaven I don't know what is. The cocktail menu changes and stays creative, while the menu is nicely focused, occasionally updated. I really look forward to going back."
"2.0","Slow service. I don't think the person making my sandwich could've moved any slower. And, when they spoke to me, they were really quiet and talking to the floor rather than looking at me. Also, how many subways don't have raspberry iced tea? This one doesn't which was a huge disappointment since I normally look forward to that when I go."
"1.0","Short review: If you are from out of town and you know what good sushi tastes like, don't bother with Kiku. It's expensive and mediocre at best. Open question to Kiku: Where do you get off not listing your sashimi prices and then charging as much for four pieces of tuna as you do for one of your higher priced specialty rolls? Seriously, please show me on a map.Long review: The fish is fresh and the rolls are decent. I really don't know what else to say in praise of this place that seems to be getting a ton of 4 stars. I was certainly underwhelmed. It's all pretty standard stuff ... nothing to get excited about. I only went in here because it was in walking distance of my hotel and I was craving fish and rice to soothe a Yuengling hangover. If it hadn't been for really bad service and ridiculous prices I would have chalked it up to a ho-hum experience. Maybe I'm just used to living in CA where there's literally about a million easily accessible sushi places that are just as good or way better than Kiku, but ... I was left hardly satisfied and a more than a bit irritated after leaving. I sat down at the bar and was immediately told they had no rice. What? How does a sushi restaurant even run out of rice? Are you kidding? WHAT ARE YOU DOING, KIKU? GET YOUR LIFE RIGHT!So anyway I was told I'd have to wait ten minutes. No big deal, I ordered some sashimi, since you don't need rice for that. I got 4 pieces of tuna. It was good. Then ten minutes went by. Then ten more. During this time no one asked me if I wanted any other appetizers or something from the kitchen. Getting really bored and hungry. Finally after twenty minutes the rice is ready. So I order a spider roll. At this point someone actually asks if I want appetizers. Wow, you catch on REAL quick, Kiku server. I say no, I just want my roll. The sushi chef proceeds to make a handroll and give it to the other person at the bar who came in after me. Oh, also this guy got served miso soup and appetizers very quickly, while no one was even asking me if I wanted anything. WTF, Kiku? The restaurant was less than half full so why was I completely ignored for twenty minutes? GET YOUR LIFE RIGHT, KIKU! Then the sushi chef proceeds to make about 4 more sushi plates to send out to tables right in front of my face instead of serving me. God, I was sitting right there, obviously starving and only wanting one thing! One god damned thing! If I had known I'd have to wait even more while literally every other person in the restaurant got served, maybe I would have gotten an appetizer.So, whatever. I finally get my spider roll. It was very small compared to what I'm used to. It tasted ... ok ... I thought it had too much tempura batter, skimpy portion of crab, and the mayo sauce had no flavor ... but whatever. Fine. I didn't expect much from a place in a freaking strip mall. I was really irritated and still hungry at this point so I flagged down a server and ordered a small miso and requested the check as soon as possible. At this point she also seemed to notice my soda that had been empty for about 15 minutes. She took it away for a refill without asking me if I wanted one. I didn't. I just wanted water or perhaps nothing since I wanted to leave ASAP. But whatever. Fine. Then the check came and the real inner rage began. Thirty-six f*ing dollars for 4 pieces of tuna, a spider roll, a small miso, and a coke. WTF. Lunch alone on a Wednesday just cost me $36. As hungry as I still was, I was very glad I had not ordered any other food since apparently they are charging premium prices for this utterly forgettable food. I knew the spider roll would be 14, but 14 dollars for four pieces of tuna sashimi. REALLY?? REALLY?? You might be thinking this was entirely avoidable, but there are no listed prices for sashimi on their menu. I'm used to paying about 10 dollars for six pieces of sashimi at home so I made an educated estimate that 4 pieces of tuna might be about 8 dollars. It's not. Not at Kiku anyway. For 14 f*ing dollars I want the avocado, cucumber, and rice that would have come with the Tokyo roll. How on earth does a very small portion of sashimi cost the same as one of the restaurant's specialty rolls? HOW, KIKU? RIDDLE ME THAT!For the record a diet coke cost me 2.75. Apparently I was not charged for my unwanted refill, so at least I didn't get raped for two of those. Needless to say I didn't stick around to drink the soda and I left a huge 0 for the tip. Honestly I felt like that was generous since what I really wanted to do was fight over the bill and get my money back. So, I shall conclude this review with a gigantic F U to Kiku restaurant."
"5.0","One of my favorite restaurants!!About the buffet:I've only had buffet here once or twice. It is not very flavorful to me because I LOVE spicy food. But for that price you can't really expect more. Other food:I always order chicken tikka masala-- it's a MUST! It is the best tasting curry I had in Pittsburgh, or ever! It is spicy and creamy at the same time... I don't really know how to explain it but you have to try it! I always order plain naans with it. I've also tried out other curry but to me nothing taste better than chicken tikka masala. I don't like the rice at all but I guess it's caused by cultural difference rather than bad cooking. My friend has no problem with it.Service:The waiters are very polite and friendly. I rarely have to ask for more water, and when you are eating Indian curry, not having water is the last thing you want. After going there a couple of times, one of the waiters remembered me and would give me and my friend a cup of soda every time we go there. I've never had any issue with the waiters there. They have very good manners. Environment:The restaurant is very clean and well organized. I also like the Indian music they always play in the background. The restaurant is comparatively quiet.All in all, this is a really nice restaurant especially considering their price is a fraction of other Indian restaurant I've been to in Pittsburgh. I've been eating here for about 4 years and the experience had always been very enjoyable. Now that I moved to LA, I really miss this place."

"4.0","Redbeard's on Sixth is one of my favorite downtown bars.  It's got your basic bar food and a good draft list.  It's nice and clean but without a lot of bells and whistles other downtown bars think they need.Service is friendly.  Redbeard's is one of my standard reliable places for pre- or post-game drinks.  This place gets four stars just for having my essentials."
"4.0","Was in Pitt just for the weekend, and if you're a French toast connoisseur/-euse like I am, I'd order it here. Not at all flimsy or soggy, three slices, done just right, impressively simple, just as French toast should be, and would order again for sure. Crowded on a Saturday morning, and even though they said the wait was twenty minutes, we were seated in two, and we were served our food just as unexpectedly quickly. Silver seal of approval :]."
"5.0","I came here for the first time with my fianc√© and it was exquisite, we enjoyed two savory crepes and then finished up with a classic Nutella crepe that we shared. The decor is beautiful, reminds me of a Parisian cafe in France. The walls are covered in beautiful photos and paintings, each one more beisroful than the other. The environment is intimate yet spacious. I can't wait to come back in the summer to sit out under the rainbow umbrellas on the terrace!"
"5.0","TLDR: My favorite brunch place in all of Pittsburgh! I'm a BIG fan of brunch. (Yes, basic I know) I've tried a lot of brunch places all around Pittsburgh but without fail this is the place I always brings my visiting out of town friends.  First off - this place has HUGE portions. As a hungry college student who always packs my leftovers, this is something that I always appreciate. Second - lower prices don't necessarily mean lower quality! Hands down the blueberry ricotta pancakes are one of my favorite things here. Light and fluffy with a hint of ricotta! If you're a savory breakfast person, try the guy's breakfast which comes with eggs, meat of your choice, potatoes, and one pancake! (best of both worlds) If you're a burger fan like me, try one of the burgers - my second favorite thing here (The Hawaiian one is one of my favorite) I love the system of lining up at the door, ordering + paying first, and then going and finding your seat. I I prefer the upstairs seating because of how spacious it is. Beware the wait can be a little long on weekend mornings - try to go a little earlier to avoid the line. If you're looking for not an overly expensive brunch without sacrificing the quality, check this place out!"
"5.0","The food is amazing.  Marjorie Simmons was our server.  She was very professional and pleasant.  We wanted to share a steak and she was so accommodating to us.  We were asked if we were having time constraints up front to meet our needs.  If you love food and great staff please eat here!"
"5.0","Spent the day at Arnold's tea getting some work done. I had the peach apple cobbler tea (delicious) and a slice of lemon ponied cake. The shop was spacious and quiet, making it an excellent place for meetings and getting work done. This is definitely my go to spot next time I'm in Pittsburgh!"
"5.0","We made reservations here for 8.15pm on a Friday night. We arrived early at 7.45pm and thought we would have to wait, but they were already ready and seated us! We were seated at a high table that was close to the open kitchen so we had a good view. The place has a great late night dinner vibe, with a DJ starting to play music shortly after we were seated. We ordered the sashimi platter, hand rolls, grilled whole fish, grilled chicken and pork belly skewers, okonomiyaki, and mushroom ramen. We particularly enjoyed the handrolls, whole fish, skewers, and okonomiyaki. It's a great place to order a few things and share, ideally between two people. Prices were very reasonable for the quality and preparation that you get. Service was good throughout. We can't wait to go back and try more offerings. Definitely make a reservation before you go, as the wait time was 1.5 hours when we went."
"5.0","Best pizza place hands down! Customer service is excellent and the way the staff welcomes you in and makes you feel at home is top notch! Haven't been to another pizza place since I started going here! Fresh ingredients! Cleanliness is superb! Lets not forget how delicious the pizza is! Kristen is so friendly And amazing, she makes it so you never want to leave !!"
"2.0","We wanted to love this place. Out trying new places. We ordered spinach and artichoke dip to start and I've never had more stale chips and the dip was ice cold... we won't be back!"
"2.0","I really wanted to like this place as a plant based eater I am always on the look out for new vegan friendly eateries. The unfortunate thing is that Freshii sucks. I went in one day mid day to get a juice and I learned that all the juices were premade and they had mostly sold out. The soup was bland and the tofu in the soup was spongy with no preparation.In the week they open I went in and ordered a bowl with no cheese and I always so no cheese at least 3-4 times because I understand that putting cheese on something is so automatically, my bowl was still prepared with cheese and then the two workers behind the counter got hostile with each other over the mistake very unprofessional."
"5.0","What a wonderful bar. The people were very friendly and inviting. I am very glad that we stopped."
"5.0","In my opinion, Thai Gourmet has the best Thai food in Pittsburgh.  Being Southeast Asian, I've had quite a bit of Thai food, authentic and not.  Their food is authentic, and they say it is also family owned.  I have only came for the $10ish lunch special.  I don't know a better deal than that!My go-to choices are the Red Curry with chicken (spice level 7) or the Pad Z-Ew with beef (spice level 5).  They give plenty of food and I usually have leftovers at the end.  I'm never disappointed, whether it be the food or the service.The outside appearance of this place isn't the greatest, but don't be shy.  Thai Gourmet is nicely decorated inside, and the food is surely going to keep you coming back."
"4.0","With our Groupon rapidly approaching expiration, we finally made it in to Tamarind last Sunday to cash it in!  It was a hot evening, but fortunately we found pretty easy parking on Craig Street and didn't have to walk long before we reached the renovated house that is Tamarind.  We both loved the atmosphere immediately - it looks like somebody's home, with a few stained glass windows, staircases behind the kitchen, and tables by sunny windows.We made a reservation (which you need, for the Groupon), and we were seated immediately.  There were quite a few other patrons dining in - definitely a popular place.  On Sundays they have a deal where for $25, two people can get an appetizers, two entrees, and a side of bread.  If you have the Groupon, you can't take advantage of this deal, but that's okay - you'll just have to come back another time (and trust me, you'll want to come back!)We started with waters, and I got a mango lassi - Tamarind's version is sweet and refreshing, a perfect complement to the meal.  We skipped appetizers, knowing how full we get at Indian restaurants, and settled on Saag Paneer, Lamb Biryani, and a side of Onion Naan.  We were warned that the lamb biryani was spicy, and assured our server that we could handle it.  The naan came out first - very fresh and crispy.  The flavor was mild, not very onion-y but you could see the little flecks of charred onion dotted throughout the bread.  We both inhaled our first slices, stopping only to put spoonfuls of chutney on our plate for dipping (the green one is VERY potent with mint flavor).The entrees were presented beautifully - I could not wait to devour them.  The saag paneer looked rich and succulent, with big heaps of cheese surrounded by vibrant spinach.  A small bowl of mild, soupy lentils accompanied the entree, as did plenty of basmati rice.  The lamb biryani arrived in a generous, heaping portion, and the smell of spices filled the table.  A cooling raita was served alongside.We agreed that the saag paneer was one of the best versions of this classic dish that we've ever had.  It was creamy, luscious, and flavorful.  It was undoubtedly a cut above the rest in terms of quality and freshness.  The biryani was also excellent, though not nearly as spicy as advertised!  We were a little disappointed about that, and joked that if the server is warning us about spice, we expect to be perspiring and reaching for water!  The taste was wonderful, rich with cardamom, and the lamb was tender and flavorful.  All around, it was better than what we've had at most Indian restaurants.  These dishes that we've had dozens of times were raised to a new level by Tamarind.It's not terribly expensive either, very reasonable prices considering the large portions and lovely atmosphere.  Even though Coriander is down the street from our apartment, we both agreed it would be worth the drive to go to Tamarind next time we have a craving for Indian food!"
"5.0","Went here for Sunday lunch with some friends. Small place, but not crowded. The tacos came out fast and were amazing!!"
"5.0","I was introduced to this place while on a food tour last year. Went back to see what goodies they had. They just made wedding soup and it was the BEST soup I have had. Also picked up breaded butter chicken and pasta primavera. This place is amazing!! It feels like you are walking into grandmas dining room. You can feel the love that is placed in the food. They also have other gift items you can purchase. Check them out!!"
"5.0","Friendly staff, clean environment, yummy pastries. Definitely a good place to study (read procrastinate) when you need a break from the library. My favorites are their artisan chocolate pastry and asiago bagel (yum)."
"1.0","To put it simply, this restaurant needs a new name.  Fresh i the last word I think of here.  I ordered the Buffalo Chicken salad with the dressing on the side, by the time I sorted through the slimy lettuce I was left with blue cheese, carrots, old mushy tomatoes, and old dried out celery.  I was too afraid of getting food poisoning from the lettuce I ended up throwing everything away.  Very disappointed, I will never return. On top of the terrible experience, I paid an absurd amount fr the quality."
"5.0","I'm not joking. If I died and spent an eternity here it would probably actually be alright.The food is extremely good, and the variety is stunning.Best of all, the servings are very, very generous and the prices are very reasonableThis is a family friendly place where all clean, respectful people are welcome and given wonderful service."
"1.0","I had a hair in my food and was told it was just egg. It was a short black hair. Never have I ever been treated so crappy.  No way will I ever come back here."
"5.0","I love Genoa's. I've been eating here for the last couple years and every time I introduce a new friend to this place, they are excited to share it with someone they know! Let me just say, Genoa's dose cheese fries better than anyone. Also, they have great pizza (obviously) and their hoagies are awesome. I've tried a lot of different items on the menu but my most recent love is the eggplant parm. So good. The service is really good, everyone is friendly. I appreciate the atmosphere. It's really comfortable. They get a good crowd."
"4.0","While this place was good, I can't say it blew my mind. I had the omelette with bacon, ham, and spinach. It was HUGE, and it came with crispy homefries (potatoes). My boyfriend had the Blueberry Ricotta Pancakes which were delicious. Wish there was a hint of lemon to cut the ricotta and carb-heavy taste! Coffee was good. Service was good. Parking is a pain in the Pittsburgh Strip District - expect $5-$10 let parking with short walking distance to the restaurant."
"3.0","This place has a cute look and a great local feel with tasty, if Americanized, food. We stopped by late in the evening on our way to the bar for a quick bite to eat. The trendy concrete bar and the colorful decor gave the small venue a more open and bright atmosphere. The restaurant was super full, which is hard to navigate with the tiny space being essentially a wraparound bar for seating. After a while, though, it cleared out enough for our party to take a seat. I ordered one chicken and one carnitas taco, and split an order of nachos without meat. It was pretty awesome to see my food be prepared right in front of me as I ordered, and that transparent open concept really works for them. The cooking space was especially tiny and it was interesting to see it all come together with so little to work with. However, from the perspective of an LA native from a full Mexican family, the flavors weren't super spot on. The carnitas especially tasted like a sweet pulled pork I might expect at a barbecue, instead of fatty and savory carnitas. Certain toppings like cheese and a 'pico' that was literally just tomatoes made it feel very inauthentic. Still, my food came out quickly and was pretty yummy. I appreciated the tortillas being warmed on the griddle and acquiring a bit of a toast, a touch that's only achieved by using a com√°l like that. The nachos were very standard but tasty nonetheless. I saw both the cook and the cashier make friendly conversation with familiar regulars. It really contributed to the cozy, personal vibe of the whole place, without slowing down their service. For a quick fix, we were pretty happy with what we had. But for authentic Mexican flavors, they've got to get out of their comfort zone a little more."
"1.0","Based purely on customer service, can't say much about the food. Yelp stated they're open but their small sign in the corner stated different hours of operation. Before I noticed it though, I was in line, as the staff walked by and chuckled and not having the common courtesy of telling anyone they weren't open yet. You could already tell the staff were people that would find pleasure from such a trivial thing."
"5.0","First time eating here and I had a great experience. While scrolling through the reviews, I noticed one of the reviewers took away a star or 2 due to customer service. In his review he said the person working the front counter should explain to people how their process works (you order at the counter and they deliver your food to your table). Well they did explain the process to me when I walked in, so they must read the Yelp reviews and take action to improve the customer experience--so to me that's good. Also it is a cafe not a fine dining experience--so with my expectations of it being a cafe set in place, I personally thought their customer service was great. The food is fantastic which is the most important part of a dining experience for me. Prices are very reasonable and the food is high quality. I had the Ciabatta and Lox sandwich which came with a side of potatoes. I was seated quickly and got my food quickly. I will return in the future"
"4.0","Super cute little place. Love the look and feel of it - exposed brick wall, random art, etc on the walls, mismatched furniture. The food was pretty good as well. We tried an omelet and an order of French toast - neither disappointed. The only drawback to this place is the noise (and the kitchen staff leaving the back door open on cold days). But that's minor - and truly, it's just s testament to the place's popularity. Would definitely recommend."
"4.0","I came to Capital Grille for a private party, and it was a delightful time.  I am really glad I wasn't the one paying for the party, as the prices seem steep.  As it was a party, I sampled a lot of foods.  But I didn't eat a full meal.  I'm guessing everything we ate was catered so I'm not sure what all is on the regular menu. Overall, everything was great.Before the food, the ambiance was quite nice.  There is a main dining area, and there is also a private room toward the back.  The restaurant was set up very nicely, and I would definitely come back here for a nice evening.  I didn't realize it was a Darden Chain, but this is ten steps above Olive Garden and Red Lobster.Favorite Food Sampled:Risotto Fritters:  I loved these FAR too much.  It's grown up deep fried mac and cheese, and it made me so happy.  Perfect in the cold weather.  It's creamy and cheesey and warm.  SO DELICIOUS.  I may have eaten ten (or twelve).Other things I sampled:  Two glasses of wine (OK.  More than a sample there.), fresh tomato and mozzarella crostini, proscuitto, smoked Norwegian Salmon on onion pita crisps, cheese platter, and grilled vegetables.  Everything was delicious.  No complaints.Ok.  I don't get the massive picture of Mr. Rogers at all.  In a place that is supposed to be 'classy,' it was just weird.  It was like Mr. Rogers was watching me eat.  I mean, local flavor is cool.  But this was just pushing it."
"5.0","Best pizza in pittsburgh and great people. Our favorite pie is the white boy. Go to dancing gnome on Fridays and grab a beer and a pizza and you will be happy."
"5.0","Best Thai food in the city in my opinion. Recommend the fried rice dishes, they are very tasty. The atmosphere is very nice and friendly, definitely would recommend it for a nice weeknight."
"5.0","Not sure about others' bad experiences...  On arrival found clearly marked order counter with someone very happy to assist us.  Good conversation as she prepared our sandwiches, quick and to order.  Beer on tap was easy from a just as happy and helpful bartender.  Beer was cold, sandwich was classic corned beef on rye deli made.  I won't hesitate to return if I'm back in Pittsburgh."
"5.0","Wow! I never had Venezuelan food before and this was just amazing!!! I had the number 2 combo with the pork and plantains.  I would come back repeatedly but am only here a few days."
"5.0","Came into Cafe Raymond for a late Saturday Brunch and was initially a little confused. You order at the counter and they bring the food to you, similar to a Panera. The drinks (other than coffee) is self serve. Plus they're BYO ($5 corking fee) and have glasses for champagne & wine. I had the Blueberry Ricotta Pancakes, cooked light, and the Croissant BLT. The pancakes were incredible, not too heavy, perfect texture and it as accompanied with warm maple syrup. BLT was also delicious, not too heavy - but very filling. My sister had the 2 eggs with toast and hash browns. She throughly enjoyed it and the hash browns were very tasty. My niece had the BBQ brisket hash. Although I'm pretty sure it was a special as I can't seem to find it on the online menu.Overall, this was a great experience. I'm excited to continue dining here."
"2.0","We didn't have great luck here, reservation at 7:15 and our meal didn't come until 9:30, it arrived lukewarm and just not very yummy.  Risotto was congealed, steak was cold, might have been a bad night when the kitchen was slammed but it wasn't a winner for us."
"5.0","Their food tasted like food in Chennai, Tamilnadu.There is something about the tonality of Chennai food: even in a restaurant it tastes like it was just made home. This is what overwhelmed me when I was travelling there. Also, everything food-related in India is fresh and ten times more flavourful than in the US. That's why I love this restaurant.I have tried it all at Tamarind and I am sure the other reviewers will help with their suggestions. Everything is fantastic.I am just going to mention here my newest favourite: okra kadhai."
"3.0","Food's alright. Nothing spectacular. Take out isn't really worth it, and they don't give the student discount that they advertise."
"3.0","I have only had the chance to experience Thai Gourmet twice, but after those two experiences, I can simply state that my Thai cravings are now going to be spent elsewhere (despite this being the closest Thai place to where we reside).  The first time, I had the Pad See Ew, and it was good... spice level was accurate, noodles and sauce were good.  Second time, I figured I cannot go wrong with what I ordered last time, so I got it again.   I could not have been more disappointed.  Just not consistent at all.   My hubby said his Pad Thai was not anywhere near as good as many other places as well.  Spring Rolls, or as they call them here, Summer Rolls are ginormous and quite scrumptious.  I wish everything else was as tasty.  Service was quick, no wait for a table, decent food makes this place okay, but I will be going to Nicky's and the Smiling Banana Leaf before I come back here."
"4.0","I have been to Bettis's so many times I cannot count and every time it is a good experience. Located a block from Heinz Field, across the street from Stage AE and two blocks from PNC Park, not to mention right on the River Walk on the North Shore of the Allegheny River, Bettis's is an ideal spot for pre-game and pre-concert drinks and food.Sizable out door patio section which is great during football season or just to relax and admire the fountain at Point State Park across the rivers. Inside has a few pics of the restaurants namesake, former Notre Dame and Pittsburgh Steeler Hall of Fame Running Back Jerome 'The Bus' Bettis.Food is pretty standard appetizers, sandwiches, burgers and some pasta dishes. I will say, one of my favorites is the Deep Fried Burger. It's a coronary waiting to happen, but it is good.Plan on a long wait if you are there during a concert or sporting event, but Bettis's is even better if you go on an off night just to enjoy the restaurant. Regardless, you shouldn't be disappointed with your visit!"
"5.0","Best bakery in downtown! Delicious pastries for a decent price! I recommend the almond croissant. It is crunch, soft and not too sweet! Love this place!"
"2.0","Waitress knocked it out of the park with her service and friendliness. Sharon you rock!!!The food was a different story. Up your game on your dried out, over done chicken in the street tacos. The drinks could also use some help. I'll give it another try next time I'm in town, maybe."
"1.0","Paid for a pizza I never got. Called the driver back after missing his call, he didn't answer. Called the store the next morning in the hopes of at least getting the pizza I ordered and they refused to do anything. Will never order from here again."
"5.0","Friendly atmosphere and loved the food! The service was AWESOME! We are not from here and were welcomed nicely."
"4.0","Ordered delivery to the hotel I was staying at for a conference. The cheese on the pizza stole the show and it made for a perfect late night meal. You can definitely taste the blend of cheese they use when making the pizza so I appreciate the taste."
"3.0","My husband and I had a BOGO coupon from the Enjoy book to use here and decided to take advantage of the Peppi's located in The Strip. We often take one day of a weekend when we are at home and bike downtown to enjoy the nice weather and to have lunch or a snack somewhere we normally would not drive to.This small sandwich shop is exactly what I would picture in The Strip District - simplistic with Pittsburgh memorabilia and logos hanging all over the walls. There was also a wall covered with framed photos of guests who took their picture while dining at Peppi's.  The counter to order and observe employees making the sandwiches was located to the left as soon as we walked inside the door. We were able to see everything - form the frying of the fries and toasting of the bread to the frying of the meats and assembly of the sandwiches. Above the counter was a list of all of the sandwiches you could order. They ranged from Italian styled subs and burgers/sausage subs to steak and chicken subs. Their menu also listed several ways to serve a side of french fries such as regular or cajun with other options such as onion rings and a side salad. Our coupon was only good for the regular Italian sub which included two types of salami, capicola, and provolone cheese in addition to a fountain beverage. We ordered a side of fresh cut fries as well. While I love a good Italian sub, this one was a bit on the greasy side for me. The meat was 'fried' which was fine but the outside of the sub was also pretty greasy. The bread outweighed the amount of contents inside of it - I was wishing for more meat and lettuce with less grease! The fries were not seasoned but there were salt/pepper shakers and ketchup/hot sauce located on the table to doctor them up. They were crispy and fresh which I enjoyed. Overall, this meal was decent and if we ever had another coupon or my husband wanted to go here again, I would not say no. The employees were very nice. We were greeted as soon as we walked in by the gentleman who was frying the subs and our order was quickly taken by another employee. They were both very polite, helpful, and eager to serve us. We did receive our food in a timely manner, with fries arriving first and the sandwiches shortly afterwards.Being a very casual, 'yinzer' place, I was not surprised when I could see straight back into their storage area. The employees were carrying sub ingredients and tubs of items from the back of the restaurant, through the guests tables to the front counter. The restroom was also located in the back and I was very disappointed when I walked in and the whole room smelled of urine. Thankfully it was a quick stop for me. Overall, this place is solid for a nice, greasy sandwich and fresh cut fries. Do not expect anything fancy but our experience was enjoyable to the point we may be back in the future!"
"4.0","Another good spot for brunch in Pittsburgh!! My bf and I got different omelets, he got the 'southern' which has mushroom and cheese and a salad. I got 'cherry' with cherry tomatoes, bacon and swiss cheese, and a salad by the side, both are very good and just big enough to keep us full lol. The umbrellas weren't up when we went! Kind of disappointed. I like the inside of the cafe and their clean restroom. If I need to say something slightly not as perfect as anything else, it looks like they need a slightly better hood for the smoke to get out. Otherwise it is a lovely place to go to and people are all very nice. But please note they did charge for the little bottles of water so make sure you let them know that you do not need water if you don't want to have another $0.5."
"4.0","Came in on a Wednesday at 5:30 and the restaurant was about half full.  There were 4 of us- me, my wife and my parents.  We were seated quickly and our server was over in a matter of minutes.  We knew about the happy hour specials (half price apps & drafts) so we ordered 2 drafts and the jalape√±o bites ($5).  My parents ordered a water, a Pepsi and the nacho app ($4.50).  The drinks came out rather quickly, the apps took about 10 minutes.  We then ordered entrees...The bites came out first and were pretty good but not great.  The jalapinos were rather small but for bacon lovers- the bacon was abundant!The nachos was a mountain that had everything you would want on nachos.  Perfect...!My Fish & Chips ($17) came out good but not great.  The fish was a bit greasy as if the oil wasn't hot enough.  The chips were a mix of fries & waffle cuts and were very good.  The mixed veggies (cauliflower, broccoli & carrots) were perfect.  The others in my party ordered sandwiches.  They came w your choice of veggies, fries or Cole slaw.My wife ordered the Ultimate Burger ($10) med well and it came out perfect.  She loved it and the bite she gave me was delicious.  She said the fries were good but not great.My mom ordered the Hot Pastrami ($10) and she loved it.  She had the Cole slaw and once she took the small bowl off her plate- her sandwich looked naked.My dad ordered the fish sandwich ($12) and although he said it was good- I don't think he was very happy with it.  His fries didn't leave the plate. All in all, we were pleased w our meals and service was excellent..."
"2.0","I was excited to try this place because of the 4 stars but this place doesn't deserve that. Not really sure why it has that many stars, but to each their own. I ordered the lamb plate with four wings to try since I love wings. The wing plate also came with fries. The lamb was not good. Like. Not good at all. It didn't even taste like lamb and it was actually gray. I'm kind of irritated about it because it was a huge piece and got wasted because I couldn't eat it. It was stringy and just tasted terrible. That is not how lamb should taste or look. However, the basmati rice and the Mac and cheese were good that came with it. Move onto the wings, they were good except they put salt all over the wings. You could literally see the salt on these wings. Super unnecessary and over powering on my lips. The size of the wings were nice and the fries were good, though. Maybe they should just stick to fries and rice. Will not be eating from here again."
"5.0","I notice this new restaurant on my way to work a few weeks ago. A friend and I decided to try there lunch buffet.When we got there around 1130 it was ready yet but we didn't mind waiting since we had the day off. And I glad we did decide to wait! Their all you can eat buffet is amazing! They well seasoned and tender beef and chicken, rice, and a veg/green bean mixture on the hot bar and then hummus, salad, and other cold apps also on the buffet. You also got bottled water- which I thought was a little strange and wasteful but okay and coffee. As well as dessert- three different sweet breads. I'm pretty sure they are store bought but still delicious. I loved the lemon blueberry one!The food was high quality for such an affordable buffet. Even though online says 14.99 it was only 9.99! Such a deal! Definitely a lunch time must downtown"
"5.0","cozy little gem! Really good crepe + omelet + fruit plate!I think this place is better than my old love Cafe Moulin :)"
"5.0","Umami is definitely an experience you have to try on a night out in Pittsburgh!!While you have to climb two steep flights of stairs, you won't be disappointed with the food and experience that awaits you!Umami's hours make it a great late night adventure with friends. During my last visit, a friend and I  were craving some good ramen, and decided to venture to Umami around 11pm. Upon arrival, we were seated by the grill, which is something a highly recommend to people! Watching the chefs cook the beautiful dishes in front of you definitely adds to your dining experience.My friend I shared the ramen and takoyaki, and both were delicious!! The takoyaki was piping hot and it was fun to watch the bonito flakes 'dance' from the heat. The ramen was clean and not too salty and a perfect size for sharing (if you're not too hungry).Sadly, we were quite hungry that day and I wasn't able to capture a picture of these dishes.However, I did take a picture of the dessert (fried ice cream with berries). Wow was this dessert both pretty and delicious!! It was the perfect ending to a great meal! The dish comes with nuts, but if you're allergic be sure to ask the waiter/waitress for it without nuts. I found them to be very accommodating to this request!!"
"5.0","We ordered delivery from Beta Bites at around midnight after my husband had gotten home late from work and I had taken too long to decide what I wanted. This was the only non-pizza place delivering to us in Bloomfield that late, so with regards to other reviews, we both had chicken sharmola subs and fries. For only $20, including our $5 tip, we got 2 large subs and fries. A great deal.And absolutely delicious! Our food came with some sort of orange sauce that kind of tasted like thousand island dressing but way better, as well as a green sauce that was kind of basil and garlicky. The fries were some of the best I've had, and the sandwich wasn't spicy but very flavorful.We will definitely be late night ordering from Beta Bites again!"
"5.0","The menu drinks are delicious and the happy hour specials make this the kind of place you can make a pitstop to every night after work. With a selection of games there's no need for tv, but you might need to plug in at the bar to ensure you have enough battery to take selfies with your drinks to send to mom! There is a perfect mix of Mount Washington regulars and Mon Incline tourists that makes for a conversation that'll really remind you of how exquisite this city is!"
"2.0","I went here late at night after going out in Southside so it was reasonably packed. I only wanted two vegetarian tacos to take home and the line was massive. I didn't mind waiting and I had a friend get the food for us while we waited outside. Once I opened my to-go box to eat my tacos they were completely destroyed and I didn't shake or drop the box. I think they were too busy and in such a rush. Even after getting all the ingredients back together, the tacos weren't great. I've had amazing vegetarian tacos and these were nothing special, even if they're cheap."
"4.0","Menu looked great. We ended up getting our entree at another place but bought some polish chocolate doughnuts. Disappointed in those, especially for the $5 price tag. Just small beignets with chocolate pudding in them"
"4.0","Best burgers in Pittsburgh. We went on a Monday when the special is sliders. We sampled six different burgers. Each was better than the last!"
"4.0","THEIR 5 CHEESE PIZZA IS SO GOOD.The only thing thats good, but it's SO GOOD. Favourite place in the city, but seriously, the 5 cheese pizza. It's the only pizza I get anymore. The ricotta on it is to die for, and I usually add spinach and tomato. But it really is the only thing that's worth getting there."
"3.0","I usually hate reviewing national-scale chain restaurants, but this one is special. Not because it is actually special but because I've probably eaten lunch here over 300 times over 4.5 years. The food is OK, the service is OK, the people are OK. It's ridiculously crowded on a weekday lunch. It's pretty empty at all other times. It's convenient enough and passable. Still, I remember it fondly."
"4.0","Any pancakes that are President Obama's favorites are great in my book as well!"
"1.0","This place used to have the best Chinese in the city. It's defiantly down down hill the last few years. Not to mention they have turtles in a tank at the front by the register that have entirely to much water in their tank. It's disgusting and heartbreaking to watch the poor things struggling to keep their head above water. Hoping I can get animal control to pay them a visit."
"5.0","Probably the best bar we went to on our trip to Pittsburgh. Why? Hospitality, great food and more!To be honest, we went here on three separate occasions, on the same night! The first visit was our first time ever coming in here. It was very empty so that meant we were going to get up close and personal with the staff. We sat down at the bar and the bartender was very friendly. She ran through what they specialize in and asked what kinds of things we liked and where we were from. Which led to her hassling us about our favorite hockey team, the Red Wings, as opposed to the Penguins. But oh well :). We stayed for about an hour and then cashed out and were going to move on, but then it started raining heavily.We turned around and sat back down in the same seats and she welcomed us back and we started over again. This time, however, she suggested some food. This food was not just an appetizer, it was the BEST BBQ wings we had ever had. Anywhere. She explained that they were trying out the idea of this and the sauces. If this business hasn't decided yet, KEEP YOUR WINGS PLEASE! They were amazing.Since we were visiting, we needed to sadly part ways. The bartender begged us to stay, but we sadly said farewell, maybe to meet again. We headed back to Market Square and continued the night. Since it was a Sunday, everything was closing early. But not Redbeard's...We came back for round three. We each got wings again and some more drinks. She was so happy to see us return! Even the owner/manager(?) recognized us and greeted us back to our spots again.This bar, to us, was a taste of Pittsburgh and how friendly Pittsburgh is. This place will always stick out in our mind and will help bring us to Pittsburgh. Those wings are a Bucket List item, definitely."
"5.0","An absolute must if you're in Pittsburgh. The only place around to sell Alaskan King Crab  Legs. If you've seen Deadliest catch, the crabs are from one of the fishermen in the show. They have the best customer service and the friendliest staff. This is by far the best restaurant in the 412. BTW, you have to have dessert."
"5.0","I love everything about Salem's.  The atmosphere is a little cafeteria-esque with its plastic 6 ft tables, but as soon as you start eating, you won't care. Everything is delicious.Also - they catered our wedding and the food was awesome.  We put hummus on every table and thankfully there was some leftover that I got to take home.  Did you know that hummus freezes really well? The more you know.  Highly recommend their Chicken tikka masala.  And pretty much everything else. Yep. Just go there and eat as much as you can."
"3.0","Okay so this place was a recommendation, and it was okay food for sushi. The people were nice and restaurant was clean and presentable. Even though nice and clean atmosphere, the service was very very slow. The place was not busy at all and it took forever to receive any drinks or food. Then when bill finally came, we provided our cards, waited 40 minutes to get them back with no water in our glasses. Our glasses were empty and I had to finally get up and ask if we were getting our cards back. At that time is when they were doing the payment at the cashier. So if you have time to blow on waiting and waiting then this place is for you. However if you want to have a nice dinner and be out in less than 1.5 hours do not go here. Yes we had 10 people in our group but waiting 1 hour for food and 40 minutes for check then don't go here. Thank you."
"4.0","This was a very unique option for dinner.  The mercato has 2 different restaurants and a beer garden on the roof.  We started there with a cold beer on a warm night and it just seemed right.  I loved the open air venue that was hopping, but not too loud and crowded.  We then popped into Mezzo, their second level restaurant for dinner.  We had a great charcuterie board and a local farmers cheese board.  Don't let the name 'farmers cheese' fool you.  There was a great variety of cheese from mild to strong and soft to hard.  For dinner we each had a pizza.  The bacon and egg was really unique and pretty tasty, though I would have preferred this as a breakfast pizza.  I had the quattro formaggi pizza that I thought was very good.  The place was completely full and that might have had something to do with our rather slow service.  Still it is a place I would return to."
"5.0","this is a great pizza place! $8 for a flatbread with any toppings! out in two minutes cooked perfectly. highly recommend"
"5.0","Im giving this place a 5 on its loyalty to and quality of Arabic food, fantastic.  I just moved back from the UAE and this place has all the things I miss at a low price and with a great taste. The dining area looks like a cafeteria from high school...thats the biggest negative...but for lunch this is perfect for middle eastern food"
"4.0","Me and my wife enjoyed the variety and quanlity of the food here. Curry chicken was good, hearty and spicy. I really enjoyed the mirchi bajji, which I had never tried, very crispy crust instead of greasy. Dal and the chickpea curry which accompanied the bread were spicier than we'd like to, but were very well-prepared. Friendly staff. Will come back as soon as possible for sizzling tandoori meats."
"1.0","Awful service waited 30 minutes for a small pizza. Do not go here. Will it ever return to this place. The pizza was not good on top of the 30 minute wait."
"5.0","Had a great Sunday before Memorial Day sitting out on the patio of Bettis' Grill! Thw shrimp tacos are the best! Garlic buffalo wings are awesome! Thanks for the great service, George! You were terrific! We will be back!"
"4.0","This place has been sitting on my list since it first opened!  Finally we decide to go with some friends and I was so excited that we were able to get a reservation at the time we want. I've heard that that they are usually very busy even during weekdays. So check before you go unless you don't mind waiting. One of our friend been there before so we found the place very easy, otherwise it would take me a minute I think. The sign for the restaurant is very different and interesting just not very eye catching. The entrance is on the side-a small door. Then you will need to get on the third floor, when there are couple doors on each floor could be confusing. The atmosphere is very like an authentic/cozy Japanese restaurant that I pictured and seen in movies. They have private rooms(looks like so) for large groups where you will be seating on the floor just like Japanese. I like the open kitchen where you can see everything happening. Everything on the menu meant to be shared so we ordered a lot for the table to share. The skewers are super good. It might sounds weird but the chicken heart was the most flavored ones out of pork belly, squalid eggs. The second everybody favorite was the fried chicken, then the squid balls, the pancake, and fried udon. Ah, another must order is their fried gyoza. Out least favorite was the miso soup which had too much seaweed taste. The only thing I could complain about is it was a little bit too salty for my taste. I would love to go back there try their ramen and everything we had again and recommend it to other friends."

"4.0","So I wanted delivery in the SouthSide and I was done with Dominos and Pizza Hut.  Lucky for me in my mailbox was a menu for Gennaro's Pizza & Pasta.    I remember stopping into this place after the bar one night a few weeks ago and ordered a feta and spinach slice.  I remember it being fairly priced and oh so good.  Anyways I wanted delivery.  I called up and the girl on the other end of the phone was so nice.  I had a few questions and she had no problem answering them for me.  I had a coupon for a pizza, wings, and a 2 liter.  I ordered wings with just wing dust on them.  A half extra cheese..half pepperoni pizza.  Pizza was soooooo good.  I must admit the extra cheese side was so much better than the pepperoni side.  Wings.  Split whole wings.   I loved the 'dust' that was on them.  It was too spicy for my kids but I LOVED it!  I think these wings could have been better if they breaded them first.  The Ranch dressing that came with these wings tasted like it was the homemade type.  Delivery was 45mins.   Food was super super super HOT when it came.  Delivery driver was nice.  Well after writing this review....I think I am going to go order some Gennaro's!  I wonder if anyone has tried their pastas?"
"2.0","We stopped in for dinner on a Friday night, and we're not impressed. It wasn't busy, but the service was quite bad. We went the sushi route, and regretted it.  The eel nigiri was dry, and the seaweed wrapper was simply laid on top, as opposed to actually wrapping it.  We also got an eel roll with avocado and cucumber.  There was no avocado in it at all, and it was very loosely rolled, so it fell apart as we ate it. Nothing was horrible, but we were quite disappointed. If you've got the Wholey name in Pittsburgh, we are going to expect good seafood. Luke Wholey was an embarrassment to the name, at least as the sushi goes."
"4.0","First time eating at Mezzo and I was happy with the food. We had the small bread basket for two of us (don't need the large unless you want to stuff yourself with bread.) I had the brussel sprouts, they were extremely good and the goat cheese pairing was phenomenal. The cheese had a slight smoky flavor that really complimented the apple glaze. I was a bit disappointed when I found out the sprouts were fried. My friend had the apple salad and it was good as well. For the entree we shared a chicken Parmesan. It was perfect for sharing as it came with two pieces of chicken. It was good, but nothing to brag about. Overall the food quality is good, you will pay a small premium for it, but worth the occasional visit. I did like that each check comes with a cookie, ends the meal with a sweet feeling about the place!"
"1.0","Microwaved bacon and sausage for breakfast combined with greasy eggs and potatoes.A 100% chance of an upset stomach.This restaurant is overrated, based on some sort of Pittsburgh nostalgia.So many better choices for family meals."
"4.0","Ordered from Little Nippers II multiple times.  Each time I have been happy with what I have received, but I wouldn't call it fast food.Good food takes time to make, and in the case of their mild wings, they are good!  Skip the packet of dressing they give you and go home and put some quality blue cheese on these wings and you are in business!  Their pizza is o.k., but I have to say that I have not found pizza in Pittsburgh that measures up to the ones I can get back in New York, but then again their is a pizza place on every corner in my hometown. I will definitely be back, but will also make sure to call in or grub hub my order before to minimize the wait time."
"5.0","This place is a downtown must. Not fancy, by any means. But, that's why I like it. It is a great shot and a beer place and the perfect spot to grab a beer before a Steelers or Buccos game. I love the Roast Beef on Rye. I think they use Breadworks bread. Keep up the great work, guys."
"5.0","We happened upon this unassuming restaurant after passing the long line at DeLuca's, and I'm so glad we went in. You order at the counter while a server reserves a table for you. The food came out so quickly. The omelets are made with fresh ingredients and come with the most delicious breakfast potatoes. We will definitely stop by Cafe Raymond on our next trip to the Strip!"
"5.0","I have lived in this city for 4 years and am generally unimpressed with the restaurant located in Oakland.  However, Beta Bites has overcome this feeling and is one of my favorite locations in all of Pittsburgh.  I highly recommend anything with chicken as their marinade is to die for."
"2.0","It is overrated. This restaurant used to be better in the past. Last time it took around 15 minutes only to order the food and another 45 minutes for the food comes. When it came, all our miso soups were cold, the vegetarian sushi had no taste at all, the desert (that was supposed to be hot was cold too). Our guests complaint a lot about the service and food (it was the only restaurant from six restaurants at the city they complaint about). Next time if I want to eat a sushi I'll definitely go to Sushi Too or Chaya that is cheaper and has a better service."
"4.0","Fantastic food! Smoked Gouda appetizer was excellent. The Swordfish special was cooked perfectly and the combination of flavors superb."
"2.0","I was not a fan of Hardee's at all! The advertisements are what dragged us in with the hopes of a huge, quality burger as advertised, but we got mediocre food at best. I got the curly fries, chili dog (~$5.99 combo) and the chicken tenders (~$9.99). The chicken tenders were chewy and did not taste or look as though they were 'hand breaded.' I didn't like the honey mustard dipping sauce. It had a heavy taste of Dijon mustard and a hint of horseradish. The curly fries were not good and didn't compare to other fast food curly fries. The hot dog was salty, cheap tasting and the chili on it was over processed and looked like dog food. The staff was friendly and the wait wasn't long, so nothing but positives there, but I would not be visiting Hardee's again due to the lack of taste for the prices we paid."
"1.0","Service was slow for not being crowded. Food was cold and over cooked. The entire place was dirty. Furniture looked like it had been thrown down the stairs it was so run down. Waitress was friendly."
"1.0","I overheard a male manager and female employee making very rude and racist remarks about chinese culture. This sort of behavior is ignorant and unacceptable in any situation. I found it to be extremely offensive and refuse to visit this location ever again."
"1.0","I received 2 hoagies (half-assed crap) from Peppi's in the Strip from my friends' daughters dance fundraiser just the other day.  I paid $6.50 each for SMALL 8' or so - smushed bread, hardly any meat and wilted lettuce hoagies!!  Are you kidding me?!  What a rip off!!I have ordered hoagies from all over the place for these types of fundraiser functions as well as sold hoagies for years as a child. THESE HOAGIES ARE THE MOST PATHETIC hoagies I've ever seen or eaten!!  You should be Embarrassed and ashamed to even be selling these!!!  What a joke!!  I will NEVER be purchasing or eating from Peppi's ever again.  Horrible!"
"4.0","Good Thai food.  I ordered drunken noodles and the serving was pretty big...probably could have split it and been fine.  Went 7 out of 10 spicy since the server told me that they're known for being spicy, but I definitely could have gone hotter.  Staff was very friendly.  Restaurant was nice, with a lot of people dining in and a lot of people ordering takeout."
"4.0","YUMMY FRESH SEAFOOD!!!! That equals a happy experience in my book. The oysters at Luke Wholey's Wild Alaskan Grille in the Strip are total perfection. Slurp one of those and you are instantly transported mentally to the beach. We ate so many of them at a recent Yelp event that we nearly shamed ourselves. As a result, we couldn't wait to return for dinner and we didn't wait long to make that happen. My hubby and I order a calamari starter pretty much everywhere we go. We're obsessed and we make no apologies! No apologies needed for the calamari here! Super fresh, lightly breaded and cooked to tender, mouth watering delight. The basil marinara it was served with was a bit bland, however. Punch up the dipping sauce and its a home run.Being the seafood haven that they are, they also serve sushi. I ordered the charred tuna and it was every bit as fresh and delish as I'd hoped.For dinner my husband ordered the soft shell crab special and he raved. I also have a crab addiction, just not for soft shells. I took a bite of his and as soft shells go, they were good - just not my thing. He just kept making happy, crunchy food noises next to me.More to my liking was the Broiled Atlantic cod topped with colossal lump blue crab served with lobster cream sauce. It came with a side of grilled asparagus and I opted out of the potatoes in favor of their roasted root veggies as my 2nd side. The lump crab in that sauce had me making those happy noises every time I took a bite and there were lots of hearty bites to be had & I even shared with my boy. I'm sure it was intended to be a complete bite with the cod, I just couldn't make myself do that. The cod was really good and very fresh but for me the crab took the starring role.  The portion was big enough for me to take home lunch for the next day - minus the crab that I'd inhaled.I could have had a whole plate of just that lump crab and probably would have upped to 5 stars. Can this be added to the menu??? Actually anytime a lump crab entree is on any menu, I order it.We walked by on a recent Saturday and saw this restaurant was bumping at lunchtime, which I was super happy to see. Luke's is a welcome addition to the Pittsburgh dining scene and I'd love to see this restaurant do really well. I can only imagine what is yet to come here and I'm excited for it!"
"5.0","I've already tried a LOT of thai food in my short time in pittsburgh since thai noodles are my favorite comfort food. this is the only place so far that i've actually come back to multiple times because it is SO good and SO cheap! The lunch special is such a steal especially if you opt for one of the cheaper proteins. The family who runs this place is really friendly and attentive and I have yet to wait more than 5-10 minutes for food after ordering even when the place is pretty busy. I'll be really sad if i ever move out of walking distance from this place!"
"4.0","It's a nice little tea and coffee shop in a little bit of a rough neighborhood. There's pay parking out front and a pay lot behind the store. They had a nice seating area and the decor was nice too. Lots of different teas and panini s to go with it. I had a breakfast sandwich and it was good. The staff is real nice too."
"5.0","Our family walked here after a show at the Byham Theater and it was absolutely delicious.  The manager was accommodating and rushed to find us a table.  The wait staff was fast and courteous and the food was outstanding.  Our party of six was pleasantly surprised at how amazing and delicious Redbeard's was!  We will be back!"
"4.0","This place was good! Not busy at all, but food was good and price was fair for everything. It was winter so the vibe of the indoor portion wasn't my favorite, but I may come back in the summer when outdoor seating is possible."
"5.0","The food was delicious and priced well.  Served by a friendly staff and owner.  The flavors were amazing I recommend the American breakfast for something familiar. The potatoes were awesome.  So glad to have this place on the neighborhood and can't wait to try everything on the menu."
"5.0","Great Nashville Hot Chiken! Decor is very clean and unique - great addition to the Oakland fast -casual food scene!"
"5.0","This place is outstanding.  The variety and freshness of the food is incredible and the staff was incredibly friendly.  They have everything from goat curry to red snapper grilled to order.  It's a cafeteria type look but the vibe is super cool- suits, police, students, families.  I will absolutely go back.  In my view It's the best lunch place in the Strip District hands down"
"5.0","Simply marvelous dining, and truly authentic Japanese Cuisine. The food is stunning, all carefully prepared to allow you to experience the complex and subtle flavors that are the hallmark of Japanese cooking.Our server was very attentive, and contributed several helpful suggestions regarding my menu choices. Several vegetarian options are available.My only concern is the absence of a Sh≈çch≈´ drink option.  I loved the soft Jazz playing in the background, very typical of a fine Japanese restaurant. There's a terrific Japanese ambience overall. Very impressive!"
"4.0","So good I didn't stop to take a picture of it! Sure it was worth the wait."
"3.0","Solid food, acceptable service. Not going to make you say WOW but not going to disappoint either."
"5.0","I love the menu at Phipps. Everything is freshly grown and the ingredients open your eyes to some new foods. Last time I went, I had a vegan rueben. I am not vegan but love a good rueben. To my surprise it was quite tasty. Great place!"
"2.0","I came to visit Azorean Cafe on a Sunday at 3 when my boyfriend found it on yelp listed as 'hot and new'. We were both excited to visit and liked the look of things based on yelp reviews and photos. When we arrived, it was almost empty, but the decor was really cute. The cashier/barista was very nice and accommodating. I ordered a frios (cold brew with whip and chocolate syrup) and an American breakfast (scrambled eggs, bread, prosciutto, and home fries) and my boyfriend ordered a cold brew. Both of the cold brew drinks tasted extremely watered down, which was the most disappointing part of our stay, since we are big coffee lovers. The breakfast was mediocre: eggs and bread were fine, home fries were not cooked all the way but had some good flavors. I did not try the prosciutto as it looked like thick slices of meat rather than the thinly sliced prosciutto I'm used to. Overall, extremely disappointing, which I'm sad to say since I was excited for this place, but perhaps it was just a bad day for the employees. 2 stars for decor and friendliness."
"5.0","Had an absolutely fantastic dinner. 4 gals getting together to catch. We ordered the chefs selection of cheese and meats. Then 2 pizzas (quattro formaggi and chicken sausage, both amazing) as well as the Torchio pasta. Our server was Emily and she was an absolutely fantastic gal. We wanted her to sit down and join us. She was so welcoming and personable. Can't wait to go again! OH I almost forgot, one of our friends had a nut allergy in our group and the whole Mezzo team was SO receptive and made sure we knew what had nuts in it and made sure there was no cross contamination. Best service!"
"4.0","I would give this place a solid 3.5, but since I can't, and I'm feeling generous, I'll round up. The interior is industrial-chic and clean. The music was also a bit loud considering the poor acoustics of the place, which made it difficult to talk during a business lunch. It wasn't very busy went I went for lunch during a weekday, but the service was good. Our waiter was attentive and we got our food pretty fast. I ordered a Maggie's Farm mini impossible burger with a side salad. Let me just said that I love that so many places in Pittsburgh are getting the impossible burger. Anyways, the burger was very good. Full of flavor. The salad was good as well. The portion was perfect and I was full by the end. I will say the price is high for what you get. I understood I was getting a small burger, but for only two dollars less than the regular size one, I felt a little jipped. Overall, a good place to add to the rotation and I'm sure I'll be back."
"5.0","Disclaimer: I am giving this place 5 stars based on Pittsburgh standards of Thai Food. I'm from Malaysia and have tried numerous Thai places in Pittsburgh. I'm almost always disappointed, but yesterday, we had an excellent meal here! It's a very homely restaurant, family run by real Thai people. Our server was a very sweet woman.We ordered the duck curry, green curry noodles, Thai fish cakes (finally, legit Thai fish cakes!) and Thai iced tea. Service was extremely prompt. Everything was out in 5 minutes! Oh and just to add, the portions were humongous! I swear once portion could feed two-three people (but this is not the basis for my 5 star review - I value quality and taste more than quantity). Both the curries were spice level 10, and tasted excellent! I especially liked the flavor of the duck curry. The fish cakes were as good as you get in Thailand. This place trumps all the other Pittsburgh thai restaurants that are popular among the locals, and I really like the homey, family feel. Definitely will be back for more."
"4.0","Dat curry!I've been eating here probably too often ha. If you get the right things on the menu, (it never hurts to have a fob friend) you'll have a good time. And if any restaurant will trick me into eating a salad it's this one. Any salad with mango or beef is ok with me. All the curries are crazy good and their lunch is a spectacular $7 and can totally be halved with a friend or leftovers saved for dinner."
"2.0","We came in on a Wednesday for the all you can eat wings. While those were decent, I have to say that the atmosphere and the servers were absolutely terrible. As we were eating our food, the hostess and another server were at the front swearing left and right while also making fun of people on the street! I get that everyone is a little judgmental due to human nature, but if you're going to make fun of people do not do so while you have customers in earshot. I immediately turn to my friends, saying 'I hope people don't talk about me that way.' Promptly after making fun of the people outside, the hostess screams 'come eat' out of the door toward them. The other servers thought it was funny, however i was certainly disgusted at the childlike behavior of the ADULTS Redbeard's has hired. Not to mention, we've ordered from them in the past several times and each time our order has been messed up in some way. Some serious review should be considered when hiring people who don't seem to care about their job. I walked out of Redbeard's almost self conscious because of the things said about other people."
"3.0","The service was slow- never got a refill on water. Also the orecchiette was extremely salty. That being said, ambience was nice and the waitstaff seemed like they are good people. We're not coming back, though."
"4.0","Although I vowed to never use the word, I have to call Luke Wholey's funky. It's an old beach restaurant in the middle of the city. The menu is all seafood, the dining room is high and loud and painted with murals and not overly clean, and the customers span the whole range of humanity, excluding the elite. It's unique and great, if that's what you're looking for. The food was good and includes some unusual twists on traditional seafood dishes. We had lobster bisque, fish tacos, and lobster mac and cheese. Everything was good. The wine list is very limited but did contain a nice California Chardonnay at a reasonable price. The server took good care of us but didn't seem to enjoy it very much. We'll return when we're ready for another beach experience."
"1.0","I don't know why I keep running into bad luck with pizza shops in Pittsburgh, but it's really disheartening.  Pizza Romano usually has a decent veggie sub that I order when my husband is craving wings and pizza.  Apparently though, this time that we ordered, they failed to tell us that their menu had changed.  Instead of a medley of vegetables, they gave me goopy 'eggplant', soggy tomato, cheese, and some type of liquid that had made bread into soup.  I wouldn't even attempt to eat it.  I called and THEN they notified me of the change.  No big deal... but their new menu stated that there should be eggplant, tomato, zuchinni, and mushrooms on it.  I saw no mushrooms or zuchinni. Also their garlic bread was weak and disgusting and tiny.  Not worth it.  I am really disappointed with our experience. Needless to say, we won't be ordering from there again.  I just hope we can find a restaurant that can provide quality when we're craving some delivery."
"4.0","We made reservations to come here for brunch on a Sunday afternoon.  Looking on their website (Which was down for maintenance) and on the Yelp site we couldn't find any brunch menus.  Only lunch.  We just figured they probably have a brunch menu special that changes week to week.   We parked at a lot nearby and walked in.  Our table was ready and it was busy in there.  There was a festival going on near by so a lot of people were around in the Strip.  We sat down and our waitress gave us their menus and she went over verbally their brunch menu for the day.  I was almost set with going with one of their fish sandwiches but she described a French toast with ice cream that seemed delicious but just too sweet for me at this time of the day.  The other option I liked was Chorizo tacos and I added a side of fries because I was hungry.  My wife was in between a few choices too like their Lobster Roll or the Salmon scrambled eggs. She went with the Salmon.  She did order a Bloody Mary to go with her brunch too.  I just had water. Our food came out within 15 minutes and it all looked good.  My tacos were really tasty.  I received 2 tacos and I could have eaten three.  That's why I ordered a side of fries.  The fries were disappointing.  I know this is a fish place but I still expected decent fries.  My fries were not seasoned, they just came out plain and they were $4.  I didn't like that.  I put S&P on them to make them better but they weren't worth $4.  My wife liked her Salmon and eggs. I think she really would have preferred the Lobster Roll but she let me eat some of her eggs and they were really good.  I actually liked it better than my tacos. We liked this place and would visit here again to try out their lunch and entr√©e menu's.  The atmospheres good and the people were friendly.  My only complaint was those $4 plain fries!"
"4.0","Wanted to go out to breakfast in the Strip but the lines at each diner were just too long. Worked out well because we enjoyed Peppi's for the first time at about 11:30 AM. Solid crowd at the tables but not packed and our food arrived in a reasonable amount of time.Straightforward menu, order at the counter where you get a great shot of the guys on the grill.  Take a ticket to your table and the runner brings your food out and calls your number. I got the New Yorker (steak, provolone, american, onions, bacon) and did not add lettuce, tomato or mayo and it was amazing. Perfectly melted and delicious. My friend got the tuna melt with LTM and had no complaints. $20 for both of us including drinks and a $2 tip.Great local place, will be back again for lunch in the Strip."
"4.0","We went here for a special event and had a wonderful experience. We loved the feel of both the market place and the restaurant. We love how they were both connected, the open floor plan and how the food choices were advertised on the fall with pictures. For both the market place and restaurant there was an excellent assortment of ethnic foods to choose from and the value you get for the food is outstanding. This place makes you feel proud to be a Pittsburgh Native and what Pittsburgh is suppose to represent. The curried flavors of the curried chicken, vegetables and goat was warm, comforting, and well balanced. I particularly enjoyed the flavor of the creamed spinach although you need to be careful while you eat it so you don't accidentally swallow any of the hard seeds used to spice it! The rice was well steamed and helped carry the flavor of the sauce. Would not hesitate to order curry and creamed spinach here again."
"4.0","Great food and big portions! Delicious dishes that are unique. It's always busy so often they don't come refill the waters and sodas, but not sure if that's intentional to make room for new customers."
"5.0","The Capital Grille NEVER disappoints! From Vegas to Pittsburgh- Exceptional service specially on such a busy night! From right when we walked to the minute we left! Always perfectly prepared food, lovey atmosphere, staff was on point, Our server Horcho was so professional and knowledgeable I can't say enough! Thank you so much for making our Christmas Eve dining experience unforgettable, always one of our favorite places to dine. (If not my number one favorite) Capital Grille you've done it again! Bravo!"
"1.0","Try it once. It's got a beautiful setting and a 'Pittsburgh must try' in my opinion. But not worth it. Girlfriend and I went here when there was like no people during the day. Sat outside it was beautiful. Server was very nice but took about a while 15 minutes to even get our drinks and food was crazy long.. keep in mind it wasn't busy at all. food is like frozen and put in a microwave and just terrible. I don't mind spending $50 going out eating and drinking something nice. But this place is awful. Glad I tried it once because now I'll make sure to never take my friends and family there lol"
"5.0","Fabulous! We had a large group and went for dinner. Started the evening with appetizers and drinks. The apple shrubs quite delightful. Many had different beers and each one was given a thumbs up. The Brussels sprouts phenomenal. Beer salad had the perfect pairing with roasted hazelnut and goat cheese. Chicharrones crispy and amazing from spent grain from the brewing process. Bone marrow and pickled onions on beer bread nice combination. Beet pierogi yum! Not  too heavy but didn't miss the mark.The burgers juicy and so much flavor. Will definitely order those again. House made keilbasa was the best we ever had served with ribbon noodle haluski.Bread pudding and house made Pop tarts finished off a memorable feast. Already planning a return trip. Thanks staff for great food and drinks and pleasant service. Kudos!"
"5.0","The best Thai I've had in Pittsburgh. Generous portions, reasonably priced. Love the cashew nut stir fry. I wish they delivered but other than that it's pretty much perfect!"
"5.0","When I travel for work I always look for real food options.  So glad that Freshii is now open!  Very clean with great service.  I had the Cali bowl for late breakfast.  It is a smoothie base with granola, coconut and tons of fresh fruit.  Kept me happy and full all day.the building and restaurant are very cool with great music as well!Will definitely come back when I return to the city!"
"2.0","They messed up my order and took forever to deliver two panini sandwiches. Not to mention, the chicken panini and meat panini were both dry and lacked sauce. I only ordered once from here. That will be my first and last time."
"3.0","My boss treated myself and some coworkers here for lunch as our Holiday Meal.  I suggested this place because I had always heard good things.  I started with the French Onion Soup and then had the Shrimp and Grits as my entree.  I finished the meal with the Creme Brulee Cheesecake.  The French Onion Soup was tasty - nothing really remarkable to say.  I was pretty disappointed with my entree.  The shrimp were overcooked, rubbery and unable to be sliced with a fork.  The sauce that was over the dish was very thin, thus watering down the grits.  The dish was the consistency of soup.  The dessert was the best part of the meal.  The cheesecake was made with ricotta cheese and wasn't overly sweet.  Our server was helpful and attentive.  I was just rather unimpressed."
"1.0","Apologies in advance for the length of this review. A group of 3 of us came here for dinner around 8:30 this past Saturday night. It wasn't crowded at all, maybe 30% full. And we all agreed this was one of the worst dining experiences any of us had ever had. I ordered the lobster bisque and shrimp tempura roll. My girlfriend ordered the jumbo lump crab roll and Cap'n Crunch roll, and her sister ordered the lobster bisque and Cap'n Crunch roll as well. We got the bisques and the crab roll relatively quickly. The bisques were okay, which is the only reason I'm justifying the single star in this review to myself instead of zero (I know one's the lowest you can go; I just wish there was a zero stars option). The jumbo lump crab was completely bland and the rice was way too warm for any sushi roll.Then the fun really began. 20-25 minutes passed from our first items being brought out, and no sign of the rest of our orders. Barely any sign of our waitress. She only stopped by to say after about 20 minutes that our rolls would be coming soon, as a big sushi order was in the queue ahead of us. We asked for more bread while we waited. Another 10-15 minutes passed. We finally saw her again, and she explained that the sushi chef had recently been fired and that it was the new sushi chef's first night. She told us she would bring us our bread (no, it still hadn't arrived, despite it having zero to do with sushi).We were understandably pissed at this point, and then finally our rolls arrived several minutes later. They were way too warm, the sauces didn't taste right together, and they just generally weren't good or even mediocre.  Couldn't get through more than a couple pieces each. Oh, and still no more bread. At this point, we were done. Tossed a $20 on the table and walked out. Will probably never be going back there when back in Pittsburgh.For the record, we were not the only group who did something like this there that night. There was a couple at a table near us who abruptly left after we'd been there about 20 minutes, and were already there when we arrived. About 15 minutes after they left, a waitress came by our table with a big plate of mussels and garlic bread; when we told her we didn't order that, she swore and put it down on the table that couple had been sitting at. They had apparently gotten fed up with waiting as well. Maybe this was just a particularly bad night for the staff there, but they made almost no attempt to communicate what was happening until we'd been waiting a long time and had been unable to flag anyone down. Oh yeah, and we never got the second helping of bread we requested, which we only did because we were starving. We will not be wasting our time or money here again."
"1.0","Shitty, tasteless sandwiches. Basically could have had rice cakes for the same flavor but cheaper. Even worse service and management. Absolutely do not recommend going here."
"4.0","I came here for the lunch the other day and thought the service was great and the pieces of Nigiri are huge.  Coming from DC, I thought the price point may be cheaper but it isn't.  Granted, I usually get happy hour sushi and this wasn't happy hour.  I spent over $100 for myself but I do admit, I did indulge quite a bit.  I plan on returning at some point in the near future for sushi."
"4.0","Great place for a burger. The wings were very good, not the typical chain like wings. My wife and daughter split an order of the Mac and Cheese. They absolutely loved it. It had a hint of garlic and they wanted to ask for the recipe as it was that good. My wife had the turkey burger which was very good but she could not finish it.  The only area that wasn't the best was the queso was too thick and a little gritty. Overall this is a great place to bring the family or hang out w friends that has very good food"
"3.0","It was just OK for me. A cash only establishment that gets very busy, I just wanted a no thrills sort of pancakes and eggs breakfast, and for that it delivered. Service was a bit slow, but the big portions made up for it...almost too big...IS there such a thing? I had the pancakes that are sort of mixed with a crepe, they were huge and not too bad. My egg was quite overdone however, but the sausages were good. Prices are on point, just not really a place I could see coming back to all the time, especially with the crowds."
"5.0","Server George was attentive, knowledgeable, and polite. He provided great service and gave my family a good experience"
"4.0","For as many times as I've been to Sienna Mercato, I have never gone to Mezzo and I finally fixed that this weekend! It is by far my favorite of the three concepts featuring in-house cured meats that make fantastic charcuterie, delicious pizza, and a fair number of entree selections. We ordered the chef's choice charcuterie which was thoroughly explained and presented, as well as the capicola pizza. I appreciated that their wine list was extensive and went with a crisp sauv blanc for the hot evening. Our service was underwhelming and you definitely should make a reservation. We waited an hour and a half but were able to kill time at Il Tetto upstairs! Cannot wait to go back."
"4.0","I botched the reservation.  It was my wife's birthday dinner and I botched it, reserving a place the evening before and not realizing it until we arrived the following night and they didn't have us on the list.It was a one hour wait to get seated.  The woman at the front of the house told us we could sit at the bar if we wanted to get in faster, and my wife, disappointed, lamented that she didn't want to spend her birthday dinner experience at a barstool.And...they fit us in.  Like...within five minutes.Straight across the board the wait staff was top notch, and added special little touches to make it a nice night for my wife.Loved the wagyu beef carpaccio appetizer.  Really enjoyed the lobster bisqueWas a little disappointed in the 'special' (more in a minute)Thoroughly enjoyed the birthday dessert they brought my wife gratis.What was going to make this a three star review (but I thought better of it) was the entree special, which was a NY strip with a Gorgonzola cheese sauce with a red wine reduction.  The reduction was sweet.  TOO sweet for me.  I didn't like how it paired with the cheese sauce OR the steak.  The steak was cooked just right, but was a little tough, and I had to cut a couple inedible pieces off.  I'm not sure whether to chalk that up to not awesome steak, or just my lack of experience with Strip steak vs. Filet.When i looked back over the evening, the only thing they didn't nail was the sauce on the steak (and arguably the meat, but really...come on) and although it's a place that is KNOWN for its steak, I think a 4 start rating is deserved."
"1.0","You can tell this pizza has been sitting in the back.For awhile before my friend said it felt like his slice was microwaved and it was still cold. You can't even see the pizzas on display.... sketchy. The Texas Roadhouse sandwich wasn't bad. But you're better off finding another pizza place in Pittsburgh."
"4.0","Portions, food, & service were top notch. It was 2 couples and 5 kids. The restaurant is a bit cozy, but we were incredibly pleased with everything.  There was plenty of room in the bar while we were there. There is a parking garage right next door & there was a decent amount of on street parking available."
"4.0","This restaurant is truly a hidden gem in Pittsburgh.And by hidden gem, it is pretty hidden and hard to find (but also delicious and unique!).  Just a red glowing sign with just japanese characters on the outside, it looks like a residence.  Then you're faced with two nondescript wood doors, like a choose your adventure game.  You then trek up two flights of narrow stairs into a completely different world.  The ambiance is super cool, with the lowered tables. My friend raved about the robotayaki, but I found it to be slightly underwhelming.  On the other hand, the Takoyaki (octopus balls) and the Nasu Shigiyaki (eggplant) were phenomenal.  I also ordered the matcha slushee and it was one of the prettiest drinks I've ever seen.  My friends got the chirashi bowl and found it to be good, but pricey for the portion size and they left hungry."
"5.0","Brilliant is the least one can tell about Tamarind. Have been here for more than a year and each time, it has been a very pleasant experience. Especially if you are a CMU or Pitt student close by, definitely suggest you try it out :)."
"3.0","This place is alright. I'm only giving 3 stars because of the sweet old lady who works here. I came during an average time - there were 4 people in line - and it took a really long time. They're under staffed It's a bit overpriced for what the sandwiches are. Just deli meet and lettuce and tomato. No real sauce or flavor. Had to add my own concoction of thousand island salt and pepper. Don't think I'll come back for lunch."
"5.0","LOVE!!!  They just did the catering for my daughter's birthday and it was perfect. They came on time and the food was amazing."
"4.0","Have visited twice.  Once for a late lunch and once for breakfast sandwich take out.  First, the staff is very friendly and will explain the items on the menu.  Elsa the owner is very sweet and checking on you and your satisfaction with your food.  The Egg, Cheese, & Presunto, breakfast sandwich is very good with a salty Presunto, cheese and a well cooked egg.  My order of home fries were so tasty!  The home fries include red pepper, onions and nicely cooked potato.   Really enjoyed the Feijoada for lunch, a Portuguese stew of beans, pork, & chorizo.  A very large bowl of deliciousness. If you are interested in coffee and pastry, or breakfast, or lunch.  Stop by and welcome your new neighbor."
"4.0","Supervised by the short line during the lunch rush. Menu was simple as easy to read. Selected a bowl with protein. Bowl was fresh and tasty but a little overpriced considering I could get a comparable bowl for $2 less at comparable places.I've had the revitalize smoothie which was fantastic. Perfect blend of flavors. Looking forward to trying other items on my next visit."
"5.0","I heart this place!  We went for happy hour and it was amazing! There are huge open windows along the one wall so you it feels like you're outside when you're in here. It's a beautiful bar and the staff is so friendly.  Our super awesome waitress turned me on to her favorite drinks - I loved them all and they were so good I can't remember any of the names of them! I'm sure any of their cocktails are awesome though.  I also had the old fashioned and it was amazing!We only had small shareable plates while we were there waiting for friends but they were delicious too. Pretty sure they change the happy hour menu regularly so you're never bored. Will definitely be back -great bar, drinks and staff!"
"4.0","The food here is authentic and FILLING! Each table has a nice setup complete with oil & vinegar to start out with when the fresh, fluffy white Italian bread is brought to your table. The gnocci is one of my favorite things, main course-wise, but a lot of people seem to like the bolognese. My favorite dessert is the Tiramisu. They also offer a side house salad which is also really good (they use dried cranberries and candied walnuts, mmmm!!!). I'm not a huge fan of wedding soup, but Alexander's has one of the best.The mac n' cheese is fabulous as well. Everything here is. Nothing is done cheap. The atmosphere is dimly lit and romantic, I suppose, the bartenders are sweet and conversational, and the servers are timely, polite and very friendly. They have outside seating available, weather permitting. Decent drink specials and a variety to choose from. Alexander (the owner) is such a nice guy, he goes out of his way to make the customers happy. I feel like I'm at home here. When I go back to Pittsburgh, this may very well be the first place I visit!"
"5.0","The best breakfast in Pittsburgh!  The line is shorter than Deluca's and the food and service is so much better."
"5.0","La Gourmadine has an amazing selection of baked goods, breads, pastries, and espresso. I recently stopped in on a whim after lunch to check out what they had and all of it looks absolutely incredible. I opted to get the cocoa covered spherical pastry - forgot what it was called but you'll know it when you see it. Absolutely amazing, had almost like a creme brulee and custard center sitting atop a crunchy caramel base. Absolutely delightful. The next time I went in, I tried their gourmadise pastry which is a croissant filled with cream and chocolate chips, may be one of the best pastries I've ever had. Their chocolate almond croissants are also to die for! What I've learned recently is they also make a focaccia pizza that they sell near the cash register. DEFINITELY one of the best quick lunch items I've come across in downtown! It's filling, the dough is light yet fluffy, has a ton of flavor and doesn't feel oily or leave you in a coma after like regular pizza does (at least to me). The sauce is plentiful and zesty, and the cheese and basil accompanies the focaccia very well. Did I mention it's also only $4.55? Pair that with a hefty pastry and you've got a flavorsome, quick ~$7 lunch. Will definitely be back for more of their pizzas and to try out their other baked items!"
"4.0","Cool little taco spot. Pretty small place, but it has a nice vibe. A lot of people were getting take out, but we got a couple of the seats in the place. Ordered 4 tacos and the nachos (pretty good helping) for my wife and I, and we got out of their for just about $20. Tacos were pretty solid. Nothing to write home about it, but enough to make you happy. Both ordered the Pork which comes with enough toppings to possibly only need one. The nachos were dope though, covered in cheese, sour cream, pico, and jalape√±os. Definitely wouldn't mine going back the next time I'm in Pittsburgh."
"2.0","The food here tastes pretty good, and the prices look pretty reasonable, until you realize you're mostly paying for sauce and rice.  While all restaurants have an incentive to skimp on more expensive ingredients, the extent to which Prince of India holds back on key ingredients is insulting to diners and destroys what seems like a good value.The menu boasts excellent variety, but a non-vegetarian thali with lamb curry came with only five tiny pieces of lamb (the sum of which would be 2 pieces at many competitors), and the tandoori mixed grill--which the menu says includes chicken, lamb, and shrimp--came with but a single shrimp of unimpressive size.The food isn't bad, but it's hard not to leave feeling like you got a little ripped off.  If I return, it will only be for the buffet."
"4.0","Nothing out of this world spectacular, but they have lots of good specials, they deliver and their prices are really reasonable. After perusing a downtown hotels room service menu (which was astronomically expensive and weak) we decided to surf the net for some decent pizza, and found Genoa's. For $10 we got a good sized medium pizza delivered to our hotel within 30 minutes. Saved our night!! I would give five stars, but the delivery driver wouldn't come up to our room for some reason. He made me meet him in the lobby. Stupid. Other than that though, it was just what I wanted."
"5.0","Excellent place for seafood lovers.  My husband had the soft shell crab $36. He said it was excellent. A special tonight. I eat no seafood so I had the chicken parmigiana $23, they also have a filet. Ask for Drew to wait on you. Great person and awesome waiter"
"5.0","Absolutely delicious !!! Cheesesteak was so good ! I'm originally from Phildelphia , and I can't drive 6 hours for a cheesesteak , so Peppi's is my main choice right now !"
"5.0","I am so pleased with this new addition to Smallman Galley. The food is excellent at Sultry, the service is extraordinary and there's even a daily juice special!! The plating of each dish is spectacular, something I would expect from a fine dining restaurant- minus the exorbitant prices. Everything tastes super fresh and delicious. I've gotten something to eat twice here and was waiting to write this review. Both experiences were wonderful and exceeded my expectations. So far I have tried the chicken pate dish, chicken schnitzel and the lady lock cup. Each dish was presented beautifully, there were so many textures and tastes that blended well and made each dish unique. The chicken schnitzel was breaded perfectly which left the chicken moist and perfectly cooked however, the breading was just the right amount of crisp. The juice I had my most recent visit was the ginger melon juice. I was expecting a juice however, it was slightly icy like a frostee. It tasted like whoever made it froze melons and mashed them up. It was soooo wonderful, a perfect refreshing drink for the summer. Will I be back again? Absolutely. I intend on trying all the items here at Sultry."
"4.0","Fast, great service and great options! I had a green smoothie and it was very good. I look forward to trying some other options!"
"4.0","Very very very good!  I have a tendency to judge an Italian restaurant by their meatballs. Not the sauce, no restaurant made sauce will ever compare to Grandma's.  But the meatballs here are awesome!! 2 thumbs up!  For an entree I got a tortellini dish and my husband got ummm.....AHHHHH I don't know but it was very tasty. Something with angel hair pasta. Then we ordered dessert which at the end of the meal our waitress told us was on her because we came out in such bad weather (it's pretty ugly outside tonight). In our leftover bag our waitress put in there an entire loaf of bread for free...talk about wonderful customer service!"
"3.0","The food was good; I likely won't be back.I was planning to get a crepe but I saw the spanikopita french toast and knew I had to try it. It was really tasty, and a wonderful combination of flavors. Honestly, this may seem like a small grievance but I'm really put off by this: they automatically charge for bottles of water that you don't order. Sure, they're only .50, but I don't buy bottled water and made sure not to drink the teeny tiny bottle that was brought out (before I even arrived while my friend was waiting, no less). It didn't matter, it was on the bill anyway. The server brought our check out, and I showed him my coupon for a free coffee upon check in on Yelp. We then gave our cards, but he didn't update the original bill or itemize it per person when he returned; just ran our cards. I think he split it 3 ways evenly instead of by item ordered because my bill was only a few cents cheaper than the others. So, I'm not certain that he took my coffee off my bill or not. Ordinarily, I would give him the benefit of the doubt, but given that they trick each customer into purchasing water that isn't ordered, I'm side-eyeing this place a lot harder than I would normally."
"2.0","The service started off great! I sat at the bar and felt like the sever was going to be on point. I order a starter. The starter shrimp fritters came out really fast and was really tasty. The bar tender came back and still was very attentive. I asked some questions about the drink and settled for the most expensive drink on the menu related to cocktails. I waited for him to come back for a few moments and ordered a pizza. It took the pizza around 15 mins to come out and as I am sitting there watching him make drinks hoping mine was coming. It never came, the pizza came, I ate and was never checked on again the rest of my visit. The pizza was good and I know your thinking why did I not say anything. The bar is rather different and you don't sit in-front of the bar tender, he passed behind me several times and refused to make eye contact. My water was empty and I had to almost grab him to get a refill. He never came back, I had to walk up to him to get my ticket. The restaurant was busy when I arrived and started to empty as I was there. So it's hard to understand why he was not more attentive to his guest. My $14 drink never came, the business lost revenue. I am pretty sure them manager was walking behind me the entire time as well, saw me looking around and never checked on me once. I visit here often, love to try all the cool food places every trip. This was a poor experience and I may never return. Beware."
"1.0","I stopped in at 11 on Tuesday and waited 12 minutes while the only clerk waited on the only other customer. No acknowledgment, no nothing. I finally left. There's  no excuse for such poor service. Even from my favorite bakery. I don't intend to return."
"5.0","My husband and I love this place!  We found this on Urban Spoon and we have never been disappointed. They have delicious chicken shawarma's. Their Naan bread is out of this world. One of my favorite things to get is their Chili Chicken. I also love their Lentil Soup and creamed spinach."
"5.0","A quiet, comfortable eatery to enjoy the specialties of Indian cuisine, available at the buffet for lunch and dinner. Provided is a variety of freshly made dishes including my favorites, saag and chana masala. They offer a very tasty chai tea, also a favorite of mine to pair with a deliciously somewhat spicy meal. Naan is also served with the buffet - all for a price you really can't beat, especially if you're a college student in search of a good, satisfying meal. The menu also provides a wide variety if dishes. This joint is conveniently situated on 5th Avenue in Oakland, and is within a nice two-mile walking distance from the South Side. Thank you for the tasty eats, Prince of India! We will surely be back."
"5.0","Delicious subs! I always get the 'Santucci' with the spicy toppings! Worth the trip! I've been coming to this restaurant since i started going to college at c.c.a.c."
"5.0","Hands down the best sushi in Pittsburgh. You don't really come here for the ambiance but the quality of fish and service is unmatched. They make their own soy sauce for god sake. Oldest Japanese restaurant in Pgh!"
"5.0","Everyone needs to get tacos here. I've never tried any of the sides but I get pollo tacos and carnitas tacos here. I crave them! I'm here probably once a week. And they're only $3 a taco but super fresh. Highly recommend this place!"
"3.0","Holy portions Batman!! This was my second trip to Salem's and second foray into Middle Eastern food per say and I wanted to stick with something simple.  I love me some lamb and I love me some rice.  So bam, done! My friend, who I was with, is very educated on the subject of Salem's so I let her decide the dish for me.  I swear she said the dishes name to me three times and I still can't remember what it was called, technically.  So take note, I will be updating with the name!  I told the guy I love lamb so he dished out four BIG portions of lamb chops.  He won me over right there! The first time I went I was a little on the fence about the place.  I ordered a lamb (of course) gyro.  It had WAY too much lamb and not enough veggies.  I like lamb, but not that much!  Plus, I think I may be used to getting them at fairs where they dump a ton of that sauce (Greek, ranch, who knows, it's good!) into it.  So this was just ok for me. Second adventure in, success! I love spicy foods, but I'm a mess eating them.  I cry.  I snot.  See....a hot mess.  But I still do it anyway!  So I blew my nose through the whole helping.  I seriously wolfed the whole thing down.  It was VERY good!  I know cumin is a very prominent spice in these sort of dishes but I'm not a fan of a ton of it, because then the dish gets too sweet.  It had just the right touch of it! I always stare at the desserts, so I REALLY need to splurge soon. Hello, who DOESN'T like baklava!?  Good thing it's only a block from work.  There will be many more trips, perhaps to walk off the calories of future baklava purchases and consumption!"
"5.0","Really good indian in Pittsburgh!  Everything my friend and I had was awesome! Portions were generous (perhaps too generous?)  - We'll be going back again and again."
"5.0","Love!!  I always get the curries and their amazing!  Always the right spiciness and good ratio of meat/veggies/broth.  Their servings are generous, too!  I like the customer service too...  I always get take out and sometimes they throw in goodies in extra goodies in my bag :)  One of my staples for sure!"
"4.0","When I visit the burgh' THIS is the place to eat for a Thai food fix. Tasty spring rolls, 'just right spice' curries and Tom Ka Soups are great.Great service to boot.Tip: There are two Thai restaurants on the same street, yes-- go here, it is not as fancy.. BUT.. is the better tasting food."
"4.0","This place is great and it's also very kid-friendly so that's a plus! I got the 'Three River' which is your choice of three Maki Rolls or traditional rolls. The server was very friendly and the food came out in a reasonable time. Great place!!"
"5.0","There was a smell which travelled one street away from the place i lived which reminded me of India.And made me crave for home food which means good Biryani and Rotis and gravy's.  This was one place where my roommates and i would always go to when we had some free time ; so called the roommates reunion!The food was great and the people in Tamarind were extremely friendly.  This place is actually a house converted into a hotel,and i must say they have done a good job on that.And i love going here during the Winter's.Oh c'mon Imagine!! It is less than 0 degrees outside and you are sitting in this great place eating warm spicy food.  I can see you running out of your house for this place now. The amazin Indian place which has kept every CMU student's tummy happy :)-Smriti"
"5.0","If your craving that good middle eastern food would all the kebab favourites, shawarma and rice to die for, then Salem is the place you're looking for.The place is a nostalgia trip for someone who grew up in the Middle East and their food makes it worth the wait. Got the meat shawarma meal and was blown away by the amount of food we got. The rice was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the meat was beautifully done. I got the spinach side, which I would definitely recommend above all else as (for my Indian friends out there) is very close to Palak Paneer! The combination was unheard of but a welcome one.Their market is a go to place for all your middle Eastern cravings like canned hummus and baba ganoush, but do it before your meal. Otherwise you'll end up in a food coma too beautiful to want to move a muscle."
"2.0","Worst service ever experienced at a diner!  How Long can it take to get an omelette and three sandwiches at 2:00 in the afternoon?"
"5.0","Add another one to the list of great Thai places in Pittsburgh.  I ordered take out from here; pad see ew and tom kha soup.  It was ready in about 15 mins and both dishes were amazing.  I got an 8 on the spice scale and it definitely had a kick.  It's hard to decide btween here and Thai Cuisine but you can't go wrong with either."
"5.0","In love with P&G's. Fast frood and frelicious scraps. Watch out though for the homeless. They run the place on weekends but not well. I mean not very well anyway."
"5.0","I've eaten here all through undergrad and grad school.  I am in love with their deep dish pizzas; they're on the pricier side but are simply delicious and are large enough that the small will be enough to last me for 3 meals.  I also used to buy a large regular pizza and would have enough to reheat (this pizza reheats remarkably well in a toaster oven) for days afterward; Little Nippers has seen me through more finals than I want to remember!I've also had the steak salads here that are served in the 'Pittsburgh' style (i.e. loaded with fries and cheese on top) and am a fan.  It is a bit pricier than the other pizza shops in the area that cater to the students but it is definitely worth it."
"4.0","I ordered the chicken, shrimp and french fries to this place since they were still open when I wanted a late night bite. The woman delivered my food even after they had closed. I had heard that the food had a 'moroccan' influence to it which I had never tasted before Everything was delicious! I can't exactly describe the flavor, but the shrimp and french fries were amazingly flavorful and crispy. The chicken planks were huge. And for the money that I paid for this trio, I was very pleased. Beta Bites is officially on my list of late night bites!"
"3.0","This place was OK (3 stars) all around. If you name your restaurant 'burghers' and comprise your menu of - mostly- all burgers then you ought to have really stand out... burgers.  First off, I ordered a Mexican War street burger & size of the beef patty is smaller than what is typically served at  burger joints, no worries I have a small appetite.. . Ordered it well done it came out medium well. (huge sigh). Presentation lacked and all the ingredients were sloppily added. Mayo was just a blob, the peppers were huge, throwing it off balance, and the avocado was a tiny smear of green so I couldn't taste it at all. But upon first bite the burger did taste good - no wow factor - but good enough. The beef tasted like quality but greasy, the bun was really soft and good. 3 stars. The creative nature of this burger in particular was disappointing - no interesting ingredients, no creative elements, lack of craftsmanship. To sum it up this isn't a food lovers place... more like a chill and get a beer place which isn't bad at all. I did order a beer and it was very good, and well priced so I would come back to drink."
"5.0","My sister and I visited Aexanders and discovered an unbelievable menu.We love the food and service here.The Chicken Cardinali was delicious. It was 2 chicken breasts in a light alfredo sauce with peaches, grapes and pistachios in  very light sauce.An extraordinary vegetable medley was steamed with just the right seasoning. Within  2 week period, I ordered this entree with much exhilaration. Then, with much expectation, I ordered the Filet Medaions with portabella mushrooms Sicilian style with garlic butter and a side of pasta. The sauce was light  and enticing.The weekly specials come with soup or house salad, outstanding Italian bread and a delicious Tiramisu dessert.It is the Best Deal in town for only $26.Alexander's is well worth a visit.Lucky to have this family run restaurant in Pittsburgh!!!"
"5.0","Great food specially the biryani by special order! The biryani on the weekends is not that nice but by special order on weekdays is really good! Other food like kabas are also very tasty. Prefer going on weekdays less rush and better environment. Just loved it"
"3.0","Definitely a fun menu .. something for everyone.   who doesn't like a hot dogs, hamburgers, steak hoagies or fries!!  Good quality too.The fries are definitely up there with one of the best i have had.  Steak hoagie was fresh and delicious.   Prices are slightly above average. .. more convenient so its worth it."
"5.0","YES!!! YES!!! I LOVE DOCE!!! Is there anything else I need to say?! I've been here a couple of times... some nights for dinner & some nights after a night in the SS at 2AM. Any time, this place is simply amazing. My boyfriend & I love tacos and we both agree that these are some of the best we've ever had. Be prepared to stand in line when you come to Doce.. but it is soooo worth the wait! As many others have said it is very small inside.. only a few seats to sit around the bar at but if you go early enough you can take your food and eat it next door at Twelve! Another great thing about Doce is how inexpensive their amazing tacos are. Any taco is $3! Their sides are also cheap too! We've had just about every taco on the menu at Doce. Some of my favorites are the carnitas & the pollo. All of the ingredients that they use are super fresh and seriously amazing. Even their jalapenos are the best I've ever had.We also ordered nachos for the first time which I would highly recommend. I am a sucker for hot sauce- so I appreciate the wide selection of hot sauces that they have for their customers too. I use just about every hot sauce on my tacos. Keep up the good work, Doce! I love you!"
"3.0","Ok. I really liked this place when they first opened. I wrote a rave review about how much I liked it. My most recent visit left me highly disappointed. I ordered a chicken sandwich and a chicken and waffles combo. When I went to fill my drink, the area by the fountain drinks and utensils smelled rancid. It smelled like old garbage that college kids left in a room with the heat on all summer. When I filled my cup with coke, it came out as seltzer with little syrup. They fixed it. Cool. But the smell was still there. I got the food to go, which, especially with the chicken and waffles, I do not recommend. When you stay it's loaded with syrup and crack butter. This time it was packaged a bit differently and there was syrup on my fries (which I love) but not on the chicken or waffles and no butter!!! Maybe I never noticed before because of the butter but the waffle tasted worse than the kind you make at hotel buffets. The chicken tasted different than usual but was still okay. The real killer was the fries. Some were fine but most had that weird stale potato taste. I hope it was just an off day. Time will tell and I'll update again next visit."
"4.0","Go have the corned beef. And a good Iron City draft. They're both delicious. It's a great lunch spot in downtown (I assume this is the one I went to; my receipt says 901 Liberty but 9th is very close)."
"3.0","A lot of people complain about the food, but I don't think it's that terrible.The food could be spicier, but I'm a spice freak when it comes to Indian food. I expect my tongue on fire after leaving. The selection isn't that wide either, but for Indian buffet's it was okay. The price wasn't worth the quality of the food. :/**I've only ever been to the buffet so I have no comment on the quality of the food on the menu."
"5.0","I worked at Caffe Mona for roughly three months and I can honestly say it's one of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh. Whether you want to just eat at a beautiful place, go on brunch dates with friends and family, or relax by yourself, Caffe Mona is the place to be. Many of the menu options can be made vegetarian for people like myself and they are really, really good! My personal favorite and hidden gem is the Spanikopita French toast with the Nutella Banana Crepe and a Chai Tea Latte. I suggest the Brunch Special (three course meal with a drink for $20) if you want to get the most bang for your buck. The portion sizes are just perfect and filling as well. Being a server, I noticed that the customers especially liked the Berries French Toast, Protein Omelette, V Bagel, and Melted Sandwich. Eto and Caner, the owners, are also one of the most generous and charismatic people I know. The food is truly exceptional as well. I enjoyed every shift I worked because of the relaxed work environment and trying out new menu options at the end of my shift. All in all Caffe Mona is an aesthetic and artsy place with many regulars and addicting food that is perfect for any occasion."
"5.0","Ooooo besides the five stars for the delicious scents of baking treats alone everything tasted fantastic! We loved the variety of items and the reasonable prices. I'm not sure what else I can say that hasn't been mentioned already but we will be back! Also no pictures cause I wasn't waiting to put down those carbs lol."
"4.0","One of my favorite pizza places in the city. The staff is really what makes this place. I used to work over in Greenfield and they got so used to seeing us and made us feel welcomed. You can tell they truly appreciate the business. Price wise everything is very reasonable and the food is great quality. You also get huge portions as well. I've had their pizza, breadsticks, hoagie and fries. All very good! When we ate at the shop, I really enjoyed their second dining room of to the side. It wasn't anything special, but they kept it very clean and have a TV. For those who would be interested, they also have beer to go."
"4.0","This is probably some of the best drunk food in the strip, neck and neck with Primantis.  I used to eat here a good bit working locally, but it kind of became too heavy to eat for lunch.  Their portions are fabulous and they have or at last had a great lunch special, Italian sub, fries and a drink for like 8 bucks.  Not bad, but you could seriously split it, because you will be sleeping when you get back to your desk.  Great stop on occasion, but too much for a regular stop."
"1.0","Captured Audience is how they survive. I have been to the Wheelhouse about 6 times over the past couple of years and I can only remember one time that I enjoyed both my food and the service.  The faux wicker tables in the back are filthy with food particles stuck in the between the slats. The service is always second rate, with lack of management oversight to see if you are enjoying your meal/time.  They are very slow with drinks and to return to see if you need anything at all. Do not waste your time or money, eat before you get there and save yourself the aggravation of both poor service and ok food."
"3.0","Alright, so the tea here is very good.  And the inside is cute and it's a great location to meet up with people.  But every time I have been here (and it's only been about 4 times- always in the afternoon), the service is TERRIBLE.  They act like you are bothering them and they can't believe that you are ordering tea (or anything else).  It's pretty unwelcoming.  If you can get past the ordering part- then you are golden.And they close at 4 not 6 like Yelp says."
"3.0","Stopped in for a quick lunch.  Have not been to this location since they moved here from about a block away.  The menu has a few tacos that are 2 for $5.00 but most of the selections are $3.50.  My barbacoa and chorizo tacos were good but not anything special.  The sauce bar is nice but it was a little messy when I was getting my sauces; thought it probably doesn't take much for just one person to spill stuff on the bar.  The place is kind of amusing with all the menus pasted on a board behind the cash register and you can see some of the kitchen staff cooking.  The room is kind of dark and dingy; it has been a few different restaurants over the years and has not been updated."
"3.0","It was a very 'Meh' experience. The hostess out front was super sweet, answered some questions I had, and even let me bum a cig after hearing I left a whole pack in my Uber's car. (Bad luck, right? Beside the point) I sat at the bar to get food and drinks to start my bar hopping before the Steelers game.Drinks were very fair as far as price. Food was fairly priced, but the burger I ordered was nothing special. The bartenders weren't rude, but you could tell they didn't want to be there because the AC wasn't working. Which, leads to the main issue with my experience. THE AC DIDNT WORK. I would have stayed soooo much longer, but I started getting a headache from it being uncomfortable. Shame.If I ever come back, I hope this won't be an issue."
"4.0","This was perfect for what we wanted, today. The employees were extremely polite and quick to deliver. The food was better than expected. We would definitely order from here again."
"4.0","There were no customers eating in on this quiet Saturday afternoon, but the restaurant staff received us readily all the same. It made for a nice environment, what with the inside being somewhat dark but spacious and traditional Japanese music playing in the background. We ordered a couple donburis from the lunch menu. While the pretty lunch boxes that they came in seemed small at the onset, they turned out to be pretty filling. The tempura one came with three shrimp pieces plus a few vegetable pieces, all of which were fluffy and slightly crispy on the outside and flavorful inside. The katsu was better--just as tasty with the breading on the outside of the meat, and accompanied by sliced onions and carrots. The side miso soup and pickled vegetables were super authentic as well."
"1.0","I have to first say that I did not rate this restaurant one star based on their sandwiches.  Today was my second time at Sammy's because the first time I had their Reuben it was the best I've ever had.  I went back today and was appalled by the customer service.  I walked up to the cash register and stood there for atleast five minutes before someone said-Are you ordering food?  I said yes, they said-You need to go stand over there.  So I move over and someone walks right in front of me and ordered-no one says anything to them.  I stand there for a few more minutes until one of the rude blonde sandwich girls says (without looking up from her sandwich) What did you want.  I said-A reuben.  She says loudly-I can't hear you..  So I said back loudly-I said I want a reuben.  She says-You know they're not toasted right??  I said-ok.. yes.. that's fine.  She says-what bread do you want-I say-Rye.  So I go check out and the girl says loudly-this is for here right??  I said no-its not.  Needless to say I get back to my office and my Reuben is on white bread and there is none of the sauce on it which made it so good in the first place.  Maybe I'm being dramatic.. but it's just not the friendly Pittsburgh service and quality that I'm used to. And if you're going to choose to work in a restaurant.. then be a little friendly and have some respect for people that are spending their money at your establishment."
"5.0","Walking into (or up to) Umami set the tone for what was a completely non-traditional Pittsburgh late night experience.  We went to Umami hoping for sushi, but arrived too late, as they stop serving sushi before the rest of the kitchen closes.  Thankfully, there were so many other amazing small plate options we didn't miss the sushi at all!The meat skewers were outrageously good...we tried the pork belly, and chicken thigh...and then 3 MORE pork belly skewers as they were on special for the late night happy hour.  Followed by the Takoyaki which was out of this world delicious.  We shared a Ramen bowl, and as recommended by our server ate that delightful 5-10 egg on it's own instead of mixing it in with the noodles.  I literally wanted to ask for a plate of those eggs all by themselves.  Sooo good.  The fried chicken with gravy dipping sauce was good, but at this point we realized our eyes were bigger than our stomachs...clearly a sign that we need to go back!I loved the atmosphere at Umami for a late night snack.  Dim red lighting, a DJ spinning house music that created a relaxing atmosphere with a touch of 'I almost want to get out of this seat and dance.'  Our server was wonderful and took time to help us navigate the very unique menu.  My only mark against the restaurant is that it requires patrons to climb two flights of stairs and did not appear to be wheelchair accessible, which means a very close friend will not be able to visit Umami. I hope I am incorrect and that perhaps there is another entrance? That is the only reason for 4 stars...otherwise...I don't have a bad thing to say!  It truly is an authentic experience and I cannot wait to go back!"
"5.0","I always get the $5 buffalo chicken hoagie with soda deal. It's always a deal they have and I LOVE it. They make it fast and it always tastes good. Their pizza is amazing and worth getting over a cheap, bland pizza like other places."
"5.0","I'm new to the area and I am so glad I ventured into this establishment! The waiter was personable and timely, the food was prepared and served hot and was absolutely a m a z i n g. I 100% endorse visiting this facility as I will definitely be returning!"
"5.0","Our first stop after flying in from San Jose, CA and before attending Game 5 of the Stanley Cup Final was an incredibly prepared dinner at the Capital Grill in Pittsburgh.Our San Jose Sharks group was quite large almost filling the entire restaurant.Kenny, our waiter was 'Most Excellent' and his attention to detail was spot on.  Immediately, Kenny brought a warm basket of breads.  The house-made pumpernickel bread with raisins was the highlight, and I will have to have it shipped to California.Kenny also had an excellent knowledge of the Wine list and recommended a unique full-bodied Pinot Noir from Oregon with flavors of cherry, red plum, and dark chocolate.One by one, course by course, the food arrived and placed on our table family style sharing all of the sides and appetizers.Of particular mention, was the perfectly prepared crispy Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarello with Vine Ripe Tomatoes.The Grilled Asparagus in Lemon Oil and the Scalloped Potatoes were delicate and brought to the table in a wonderful presentation.The filet mignon was a perfectly prepared Medium Rare.Kenny also arranged for a Pittsburgh Latte to go.Thank you very much to the entire staff and most especially Kenny for a wonderful 'Group Dining' experience."
"5.0","Spending the week in Pittsburgh going to the football and baseball game. Stopped in Jerome's for lunch. Deep fried burger is a must have. The wings were delicious with the homemade sauces and to top off the delicious meal. Our waiter George was such a sweetheart. His sense of humor and his personality really topped off the experience!"
"5.0","A local favorite. Last night i had the honor to join a friend as he broke his fast on a Friday night during Ramadan. During these times, it's a buffet, and the hall is filled with people sharing the meal. Very warm peaceful loving vibe, many families, all kinds of people, even us. During the Friday night in Ramadan, two prices only:  adults & children. (Takeout $11.95/lb I believe)Help yourself as much as you like, 8PM to 10PM, drinks not included. We each got a fountain drink and went to TOWN! Ever notice that unprocessed whole foods fill you up so fast?! Decided on a new favorite dish, this delicious spicy with crunchy, everything happening chick pea salad! Might be my new go to for lunch!"
"5.0","I just came to Sunday brunch. I got French toast and it was amazing. I will absolutely come back here"
"5.0","It's billed as Mediterranean food but the real stand outs are the Indian dishes. Tikka masala and chili chicken will have you wanting to return within a couple of days. Fresh garlic nan. The cheeseburger is even excellent.  Beware, ask what comes on the sandwiches - They put mayo on the cheeseburger. They put ketchup and mayo on the cheesesteak. Greek salad is also very good. Everything there is fresh."
"5.0","Came here after seeing the good ratings on yelp and it did not disappoint! You walk in and order what you want and pay before seated. You get a table number and get to choose where you want to sit and the food will be taken to your table number. I ordered the French toast on challah bread with a strawberry jam-type drizzled on top with blueberries and whipped cream. It came with FOUR pieces!! So it was very filling. We also ordered the blueberry ricotta pancakes. I expected the ricotta to be pretty overwhelming but to my surprise it wasn't too much! I liked the combination with the blueberries and the pancakes were very fluffy:) Service was really nice and the restaurant wasn't too busy or crowded. Would definitely recommend this place and maybe even come here again to try their sandwiches."
"3.0","As Munch the food critic says, this is the place to go if you are very hungry and need that immediate taco fix.  The food is so cheap at 3 dollars a taco, that almost anything would be acceptable at that price point.  I was there around dinner time and it was a lively, fun atmosphere(the chef provides jokes to go with his cuisine, he called up my order in a funnyway) and the food comes at you quicker than a freight train.   The ingredient portions are more than adequate which makes the price point better than average.  The ingredients also seem fresh, but for some reason one of my taco's seemed a bit bland.  I got the vegan taco and the pollo taco.  The vegan seemed to have a bit more flavor, but the chicken was a bit bland and had a slightly fishy taste.  I have no idea where that came from.  I honestly think this place is the first of it's kind in Pittsburgh.  I don't know anywhere else where you can get a taco this fast that's this cheap and that is not from a food truck. For that reason alone I will most likely go back more than a few times.  It definitely filled me up for 8 dollars total including a Jarrito's Guava flavored soda.  I had never had the guava kind which was really wonderful."
"5.0","Really liked this place. They take reservations for weekend brunch, a rarity it seems in Pittsburgh. The restaurant space is very nice, try to sit outside if you can (they have a cool umbrella display). Our waitress Emma was great. Their menu has a good mix of sweet and savory options, the crepes come both ways. I had the buffalo chicken crepe which was great though the salad that came with it was kind of blah. I tried someone else's berries and crepes, it was fantastic. Prices are reasonable. One thing that was a little strange and that I'd wish they change is that they don't have tap water, they give you little Costco water bottles which they charge you for."
"2.0","I couldn't resist trying this ENP after it was rebuilt.  Maybe it's just that I haven't been to an ENP in a long time (probably the better part of a decade), but I was just disappointed.  The service was truly slow (like 10 minutes to get water?).  The salad bar seemed to have half the selection I remember it having.  (No cottage cheese?)  On the upside, the ranch is as tasty as I remember and that was the real reason we went any how.  Then, my order was wrong (I ordered fried pickles... got a burger instead?).  Our server was beyond apologetic and it was fixed in less than five minutes, but hard to understand in the first place...  Interesting to note, we learned that ENP and Sheetz have the same food supplier.  My DH ordered jalapeno poppers and noticed they were virtually identical to the ones he LOVES at Sheetz.  Quick google search later... Yep, same ones.  All in all, a cheap, quick Friday night dinner (even with the delays on ordering, we were still in and out in less than 45 minutes)."
"4.0","Went there at prime time on a Saturday night. Reservations are a must for a group.  You might be able to snag a last minute table for 2 on the right night.  Overall a very good meal and experience. The BYOB is always a plus and they actually have nice wine glasses and pint glasses for your beer if needed. Nothing is worse then enjoying an upscale meal with a good bottle of wine and having to drink out of a small water glass. On to the food. We started with the smoked Gouda, mostly due to the reviews on Yelp and the waiter's recommendation. We also had the lamb (meat)balls. Both were good, not anything to rave about. While I liked the Gouda, I certainly did not have the same experience I read about online. Good not great.  Same for the salads. Nothing special. The main meal was another story. I had the pork chop. It was a finalist on my list of choices but the waiter's recommendation sold it for me. It was fabulous. So thick and yet so perfectly cooked throughout. Juicy with a seared crust. Excellent flavor. May be a death row meal finalist. Another member of our table had the duck and felt the same way. He even raved so much to the waiter that he brought the cook out to meet him (yes, he was a cook not a chef). We had a cheesecake for dessert that topped off the evening nicely. We will recommend and we will be back. Thanks for reading. Enjoy your meal!"
"5.0","Tacos are street food and this place makes no pretenses about that. You get tacos. Delicious tacos without any frills. It's not upscale, it's just tacos. I could eat here every meal every day"
"2.0","Not great. I wanted to like this place. Atmosphere is good. Wait staff was friendly. Appetizers - had the fried chicken and perogies. Fried chicken was off. The breading was fallling off, very thick, and full of cornmeal. The taste was good (pickle brined). Perogies were hard and fried; not good.Burgers - Why are the burger patties so thin and the buns so thick? Fries are the best thing they have going. Service was slow, was over an hour to get our burgers. Currently BYOB."
"5.0","This place is a new go-to lunch spot for myself and coworkers. It's fast with counter-style seating, the tacos are more traditional (think Las Palmas, less like Smoke) and well constructed, and the pricing is reasonable at three bucks a taco. Friendly staff, good food, great price - what's not to like?"
"5.0","I've been going here for years I basically tried everything on the menu and I have to say everything is good this is the best Chinese food you will get in Pittsburgh hands-down it's not New York but it's the best for Pittsburgh"
"5.0","Great little quaint sports bar !!!! Power play burger was just incredible a must have on your visit (if you like spicy of course) we'll return"
"4.0","With the arrival of Freshii, I was finally able to expand my lunch horizon in Downtown.  Located on Grant, the place screams healthy as you walk in.  There's plenty of seats at the back of the house.  You can pick up juice, order salad, or do what I do and get their noodle soup!  Their Thai-inspired soup with lemongrass is lunch portion.  I was expecting a small side order portion at first.  It was filling and delicious!!!  I always welcome a new lunch addition with noodle option here."
"5.0","I don't know why ppl don't go to this place more. They are my No.1 Thai restaurant. Cook and serve by Thai people. Last time I was there, I had duck curry. They put so much duck in the curry. Duck dishes can be very expensive,but they sell it regular curry price. Me and my husband also live their Pad see ew. No one can compete them with this. Both potion and price make them worth 5 stars from me."
"4.0","Ate here because it was on the way from the T station to our hotel and we didn't want to wander. Pleasantly surprised to see a busy restaurant despite it being an obscure location and after 8pm on a weeknight.Food was very good; huge eggroll and 'small' order of fried rice. Service polite but not super-efficient; our food came out in dribs and drabs, and not because they brought appetizers before entrees."
"5.0","Wow!! BEST BURGER IVE EVER EATEN, seriously EVERRRER!!! My friend raved about a drunken meal eaten at this place. We decided to venture to it sober to see if the food was as good as he remembered. It was better! I ordered the Diner burger. It's two beef patties (honestly, it could've been made with just one), bacon, American cheese, mayo and sweet steak sauce on a potato roll. I chose to top it with an egg based on the server's recommendation and it def did not disappoint! The burger was also accompanied by the most delicious salted-vinegar fries. I finished half the meal for dinner and was satisfactorily full! I ate the other half the next day and was still blown away by the flavor of this meal. Cinderlands has def set the bar for all my future burger experiences! I also tried the Chai beer. If you like spiced beer, like pumpkin beer, or chai tea, I highly recommend this beverage. Overall, I can't wait to visit Pittsburgh again and eat at Cinderlands! Their menu looks delicious and if it's anything like my burger experience, I think I might need to marry their chef! Lol. Ill def be adding this place to my recommendation of things to do in the city of three rivers. Kudos Cinderlands!!"
"5.0","Great food, and amazing customer service. I order for delivery all the time and it always comes on time and fast. No matter of the weather. The drivers are also very friendly. I highly suggest that everyone would order from here, they are the best in pittsburgh. Even if you have dine in, it is very cozy and very friendly surrounding. You can not find any place better than Gennaros pizza. And they serve alcohol!!!!"
"3.0","I'm sorry but I'm done with this place. They are nice but the food service worker was definitely sick and touching way too much of himself while preparing my food. I watched him touch his hair on multiple occasions and he literally was sick with a cold or withdraw (he looked absolutely miserable).  Maybe management should have covered his shift with someone not passing germs around.Also, my meal came in a deli cup, not cool. Explain to me while I'm eating out of a large deli container when I'm not even at a deli. I got the buffalo Mac n cheese, it was okay and chicken was really good. I use to just think this place was super clean and craft made, I don't get that vibe anymore.Sick"
"5.0","'Authentic Thai food with probably the BEST lunch deal'Thai Gourmet's lunch special is really bang for your bucks! Seriously, this might be the best Thai lunch deal in Pittsburgh.You get to pick from 27 different entrees, add meat or vegetables, and choose the spiciness. This comes with either Tom Yum Soup or Wonton soup. Also the best part is that this will most likely come under $10! Also, Their portions are pretty decent and I was very full by the end of the meal. I ordered the Pad thai with pork in spiciness level 7. I love and can handle spicy food (Korean, Thai food are my fav), so I choose 7 and it was perfect. My friend ordered a 5, and we could barely taste the spiciness, so if you like spicy food I recommend choosing 7 or above. There wasn't any line and the place didn't seem too busy even during lunch hour. But this place isn't too big doesn't have too many tables."
"3.0","I had to checkout Pamela's because of all the high ratings.  Didn't know they were a CASH ONLY kind of place boo. Come on now who does that.  Didn't know you had to it was metered parking double boo.  Couldn't find the restroom triple boo!? Maybe that ones on me I just couldn't figure it out, outside!?So how does banana walnut crepes on Walnut Street sound like!? Why not.  I ended up ordering some and they even split the 1 order of crepe into 2 plates and loaded them for us which was nice. Their famous crepes weren't so amazing as I hoped they were barely OK for me, they are just crepes. I would have like to try more the menu but I only had like $10 in bills and coins. And again another place that only takes cash really. I don't get it.  If you're ever here with nothing but $10 in bills and coins you order wisely.  You start looking over their menu and notice wow everything's famous, famous lyonnaise potatoes, famous crepe, famous corned beef hash, famous egg salad, etc. haha.  Don't waste your time with the crepes for about the same price or a little more, you should go for something else on menu, everything's under $10 and inexpensive.  Stretch your dollar and order a soft drinks that has free refills and bottomless coffee or just order a water.  They have lots of different omelets and sandwiches. Inside there are a lot of seating, tables and chairs are old and so are everything else about it.  There's a wall of photos in the back wall.  Service was friendly and I had to tip in coins. But I'd try one of the other locations or something else. Other possible MEH but I'll leave it as a OK.'18% gratuity may be added to parties over 6' on the menu, does that mean that if I'm nice enough I don't have to pay?"
"4.0","A really solid lunch place downtown, especially when you're not trying to kill the days calories. Have had a time or two though where my online order just never showed up. But they fix it right away as soon as you mention it. I love the variety of either a salad, rice bowl, or noodle bowl."
"5.0","Chinatown Inn is the BEST CHINESE RESTURANT I have found in North America! HUGE FAN! and have been supporting Chinatown for over 25+ years. I can't say enough about this restaurant. I have had lunch in , dinner in and have had take out numerous times over the years. Chinatown has NEVER disappointed me once. I love the Shrimp Eggs Rolls, Chicken & Broccoli in the white sauce with steamed rice. I live for the Won Ton Soup !! it is so unique that they shred the pork on top of the soup and not inside the wrapper, I love that. I always get a medium bowl and a medium steamed rice on the side. After I eat the won ton, I put the rice in the soup and enjoy two soups from one bowl. Won Ton, and Chicken and Rice. The Jumbo Egg Roll is a meal in itself. Everything on the menu is good. True the downside to Chinatown if you do not live in town is driving in, street parking is not a problem for pick up, and there are many parking garages near by. A visit to Chinatown is SO worth it. Lucy is a fantastic server and I look forward to talking with her every time I visit. I Highly Recommend and will continue to support Chinatown Inn.  Just as small side note: The actress that is the voice of Mulan in the Disney movie, is Ming-Na Wen. Her step-father and mother and younger brother have owned and operated Chinatown for years and will continue too. You can find her photo on the wall near the register."
"1.0","This place seriously just took my order for delivery, charged my card taking my last $15 (hard times) only to call me back 30 minutes later saying they don't deliver to my street!!!! So my son and I won't eat tonight because these idiots can't properly train their staff by having a list of 'do not deliver to ' streets!!!  Thanks wise guys!!!  I'm literally in tears wondering how I'm going to feed my kid tonight..."
"5.0","Truly made my day! The owner, Lauri (Lori?), is a wonderful woman, and the cashier was super nice and helped me pick out a soup and a juice that not only suited my tastes, but made me feel energized during my chest cold. Not only can I be super picky, but I'm a vegetarian, and the experience did NOT disappoint. Pleasant employees are just as important as the food being prepped and served, and I will be going back ASAP. If you love wholesome, healthy food, and great customer service this is the place to go! Side note, GET THE DETOX JUICE. It was so delicious and fresh. :D"
"5.0","I should start off my review by saying I have never liked Indian food. All the Indian food I have ever tried I disliked and so I avoided eating it for most of my life. But when some friends invited me out to Tamarind, I decided to give Indian food another try.The Chicken Tikka Masala was so good that I swear it's the only thing I ever want to eat again in my entire life. It was truly one of the top 5 best things I've ever eaten, without a doubt. The sauce was creamy, rich, and flavorful, the chicken was cooked beautifully, and it was just absolutely amazing overall. I've also had their Chicken Vindaloo which is spicy and delicious, and their Chicken 65 starter was really delicious too and came with this really lovely mint chutney. Their garlic naan is also exceptionally good.The restaurant itself is in this beautiful house and while the environment was a bit noisy at times, the restaurant was clean and all of the staff were very nice and attentive so it was a nice experience eating there.Everything I've eaten from Tamarind has been incredible and I will absolutely be ordering from them again many more times in the future. I definitely can't say that I don't like Indian food anymore now that I've eaten at this amazing place!"
"5.0","This was without a doubt my # 1 food highlight from Pittsburgh. I visited Pittsburgh 2 weeks ago. While researching the best places to eat here, this market/cafeteria kept showing up alongside much more upscale restaurants. This was intriguing , so I had to check it out. What I found was an amazing selection of halal Middle Eastern & South Asian cuisine, and a vibrant community. I went with the tandoori chicken kebab w/ biryani rice & salad. Everything was fresh and very tasty. Also, the portions here were very generous, and the prices were great. The service and ambiance were very nice as well. I can strongly recommend this place, and I look forward to returning the next time I visit Pittsburgh."
"4.0","My friend and I ordered the mushroom crepe which came with a side salad and the brie fig apple French toast. The crepe was phenomenal and I would not change anything about it. The combination of cheese, mushrooms, and onion hit the spot. The French toast however, needed more sweetness maybe if they carmelized the apples it would of helped. However, I did appreciate the amount of brie cheese they use on the French toast.  As for service it was not the best even though there were only two other people there with us. Price wise it was okay. One downfall was we asked for water with our coffee and got small bottels which I thought was nice until I seen on our bill that we got charged for it. A bit ridiculous to me."
"5.0","We tried MR Bulgogi at Hitchhiker in Sharpsburg. The bulgogi is insane and the dumplings are addictive. The saltiness of the food with the ice cold brews made this the perfect marriage. I would not only eat here again - but I would actively seek them out! YUM!"
"5.0","If you love sushi, this is the place you have got to try! Great atmosphere, but seating is maybe a little crammed and close together. Other than that- FANTASTIC Sushi, and great dessert menu."
"5.0","All I can say is this is my favorite spot for taco's. I can sit here and rave about it, but you seriously need to go try it out for yourself. The staff is so cool and friendly, you cant beat these prices and it is super clean. The food is always fresh and the cook will always answer any questions with an upbeat attitude. I cant say enough great things about this place. The pork taco is by far my favorite, but they offer many other options including chicken, beef and a veggie taco as well as nachos, beans, and now chili."
"2.0","The ONLY reason to come here is for happy hour, other than that, just don't. And for happy hour I'm not saying it's better, it's just cheaper. I came with coworkers for happy hour yesterday and at first we were going to sit at 2 separate tables but then half of us just decided to stand at the bar. So I'll give you the run down at the bar and at the table: Bar: this isn't Southside on a Friday night, it shouldn't take me more than 10 minutes to get a glass of wine. The issue isn't necessarily the bartenders (even though they definitely were socializing a lot considering how many people needed drinks) it's the fact that they're SEVERELY understaffed behind the bar. The picture I took shows half the bar and look at the drinks. Every single person has an empty glass. Isn't that the number one responsibility at a bar? Table: the waiter was beyond confused the entire time. He would come back and say something wasn't available or it was kicked or offer a drink for free then at the end he charged everyone for everything and was like oh I forgot. Getting checks was a literal nightmare also. Considering this is in the Casino and I'd imagine the goal to be pump people in and out so they can gamble, they definitely fail at that. Anyways, the food is super mediocre also."
"4.0","Great restaurant experience. Service and food were excellent. Smoked Gouda app was tremendous. Loved that salad comes with entrees with choice of three housemade dressings. BYOB and enjoy. Highly recommend!"
"3.0","It ought to be 3.5. Since overall it has been overrated, I'll give 3. The food is pretty Authentic while being cooked too dry ruins the flavor. Decor is fine, with nothing to emphasize or criticize. Service... slow but alright. Taste: 3.5Decor: 3.5Service: 3Overall: 3.5"

"4.0","Nice 1/2 off wines by the glass on Mondays. My boyfriend and I did the pick your own pasta, sauce, toppings. We both chose the agli oilio which needed roasted garlic for more flavor. I had the matalda pasta which was new for me and it was excellent with sun dried tomatoes. Service was ok and was short staffed in our opinion. We sat on the patio but next time will opt for the dining room. We thought the value was good for what we got. I'll go back next time I'm in the area."

"5.0","Oh man, this place!!!! I come here, more than maybe any other restaurant in the city. I'm lucky in that this Gem is close to my work most days. They have a kinda cafeteria style thing going on here, you can order from the grill, one of the better burgers in the city for the price, 6$ or so, shish kebabs, and on and on, I've found the nan Philly cheesesteak to be maybe my favorite sandwich there, but beware! They normally put ketchup on both the burgers and cheesesteaks by default, so if you detest the stuff like I do, order it on the side, then you can make a big public display of throwing it out and go on and on about it, if I'm there, man I'll be cracking up. Hahah, anyway, aside from the grill, they have a big selection of prepared meats and usually 4 vegetarian dishes, the meats, which includes rice, are usually goat, ca few types of chicken, lamb, etc. all are completely delicious and total comfort food. A large dinner is enough for two, especially if you pick up the complementary pita bread at the register . Yeah!  The staff are all super nice, the place is always really clean, and the price is right!  I will say that the lunch hour does get packed, but the line does move pretty quickly. 6 stars!"
"5.0","This place is freaking awesome. I happened to come here twice within the past week and it's been delicious both times. Although my taste buds have not been educated on the authenticity of Indian food I can guarantee this place won't disappoint even if your taste buds are. There's very few places in Pittsburgh I've tried so far that I would go to again (granted I mean around CMU), however, this place is definitely on my list of go-tos now."
"5.0","Buy 1 get 1 coupons. Try and get that at the trendy burger places. Cmon its just burger and fries."
"5.0","I placed a to go order for Tom Yum soup and Pineapple Curry with chicken. It was ready in less than 5 minutes and the portions were huge! The soup was perfect and the cilantro was really fresh. The Pineapple Curry was a delicious blend of spicy (I did 7 out of 10) and sweet from the pineapple. I highly recommend this family owned authentic Thai restaurant on Liberty Ave in Bloomfield."
"5.0","It's late night that ends at Beta Bites is ALWAYS a legendary night. Fantastic food, fantastic vibe, always a great choice."
"3.0","Love the look and feel of this rooftop bar, hate the service. Have been here a few times and they definitely need to hire more people. We were here on a Friday night so it was busy. Our waitress came over relatively quickly to give us a round of drinks then she was never to be seen again. 1.5 hrs later I left. I had to get home so my friend stayed to close out my tab. She said she waited another 30 min and she never came back! She then went to the hostess who said the waitress has to close the tab. Ummm where is she? The hostess located her to close the tabs but really? You disappeared for 2 hours? Really wish they had better service here."
"5.0","If you like Japanese food, go to Kiku.If you are thinking about the possibility of putting raw fish in your face for the first time, for the love of god, go some place where you'll have a good experience, which in Pittsburgh means Kiku. Some might claim it's too expensive. NOT SO. The prices are low considering the  exquisite quality and portion size of the food, the meal add-ons (everyone gets their miso soup!) and the fantastic ambiance. This is the one place I've been repeatedly (probably upwards of 20 times, no joke) that has never ONCE disappointed in any way. What Kiku says on its website:'KIKU emerged from Sushi Gen, a popular Tokyo sushi bar. KIKU's owners migrated to Pittsburgh in 1983, and were one of the first restaurants to serve sushi in Pittsburgh. KIKU, which was designed to resemble a tea house, has been serving authentic, top quality Japanese cuisine since.'is TOTALLY TRUE. Having been to Japan several times, and being therefore something of a Japanese food snob, (why can NO ONE IN AMERICA GET THE RICE RIGHT!??) I found a bastion of authentic, amazing Japanese food right in my own back yard! Does Kiku's menu feature some of the American 'sushi staples?' Of course it does. They have to make money in the Pittsburgh market, after all. Does the fact that they have a Philadelphia Roll make the delicate, savory tempura any less appealing? Does that make the fresh perfection of the fish any less tantalizing? Does that make their frankly intoxicatingly amazing udon any less...intoxicatingly amazing? Not. One. Bit. Venture off the beaten path here and I swear, you will be one happy fish-stuffed camper. All this, and THEN they go and create a little bit of Tokyo in Pittsburgh (actually a lot of Tokyo. The place is HUGE compared to it's Tokyo counterparts.) But they really did accomplish capturing the soothing, serene ambiance of a genuine Japanese tea house, especially at lunch or slightly off-hours when fewer patrons stuff their maws with amazing Nigiri Sushi, Temaki, Tonkatsu and more. The service is excellent, with warm scented towels presented pre-meal with which you wipe your hands, to ever-present but not obtrusive waiters who will cater to your every need, sometimes even before that need is voiced. Did I mention they make their own soy sauce? I'd bathe in that stuff. It tastes good enough that I'm sure it's good for the skin. Amazing. Go to Kiku. And then message me and thank me for sending you there. After you wake up from your food coma of course."
"2.0","Most of this review is based off of the fact that they were busy. There VERY MUCH is a chance that this is completely different if they are a bit slower. If I ever see the truck in the wild again, I *might* be willing to try it again and see if they are better. But I also know working in the food industry is knowing how to handle a rush. Supply: They were at a festival i was attending. The festival started at 11 and ended at 7. By 1 they were already out of a few things including drinks. Its clear they either didnt plan ahead, or assumed they wouldnt be busy. They also 86ed (got rid of) something on the menue entirely because they said they were out of one ingredient. So rather than giving you the option to have it without the ingredient, they just told you that the whole thing wasn't available. ( either they were out of everything on that hotdog, which adds to the list of things they were out and just didnt want to say it, or they just refused to offer it). They were also out of Ketchup..... which for a place that sells fries, is kind of a big deal. They did have sides of ketchup, i noticed. Some people were asked if they wanted cheese or ketchup with their fries. Others were not. So they had ketchup, im guessing they were just saving that for specific orders, so they at least could give it to some menue items, rather than run out completley for sides. Which i completely understand and it makes sense. Just shouldn't have been an issue to begin with. Customer Service: The line was long, but like i said, they hadn't been there all too long, and the man at the window (with a G tattoo on his arm) was very harsh and didn't care to have a good customer voice. I work in kitchens. I understand being stressed out during rushes. I also know that if I'm dealing with customers, I don't bark at them that you are out of things or their total. (Tho i get that maybe he was just trying to be on theme... cuz bulldawgs)Food: the fries at first glance looked soggy. But actually had a good crunch. So i was very pleasantly surprised with that. The burger was nice and thick and juicy which was wonderful, but lacked flavor overall. Idk if they just dont season their meat or didnt use enough, but it definitely was bland. But it was filling and for it being a non chain restaurant, the price for what you got wasnt bad. Thats the only thing stopping me from giving a 1 star. Maybe if it had been seasoned better, it would have been a 3 star. TLDR: need to work on customer interactions a bit better, work on planning ahead better, and season their food."
"4.0","Great bar for a few hours of work as a solo business traveller. Everyone really friendly and not pushy at all. Food was good, but 'small' plates are enormous."
"5.0","Tonight was my second time visiting Umami, and with the exception of the ramen, it did not disappoint. Since we were only able to get a reservation at 4:30, we were the first people there. The restaurant filled up pretty quickly by the time we had left though, so it's a good thing we got there early! We started out with some happy hour priced drinks. I got a peach fizzy cocktail drink that came in a bottle and it was delicious. Perfect for a hot day! For our food, we ordered: an eggplant skewer which was flavorful and grilled perfectly, okonomiyaki, stir fried udon, and the pork ramen. The okonomiyaki and udon dishes were amazing and they gave huge portions for the price! The udon especially was unlike anything I've had at another restaurant and I would highly recommend ordering it. I'm deducting a star for the ramen - the broth was not very flavorful and the noodles, while plentiful, didn't have the texture I like for ramen noodles. Pretty disappointing. Overall, the service was great and the rest of our food was yummy. I will definitely be back for that udon!"
"4.0","This place is definitely a good brunch spot with delicious crepes and a cute atmosphere. The outside patio with the hanging umbrellas is very inviting. The menu mainly includes crepes, Omelettes and sandwiches. They also have a brunch special for $20 where you get an entree (either salad or fruit plate), a main course where you can pick anything from the menu, and a dessert crepe. We ordered a brunch special with the fruit plate, the chicken buffalo crepe and a strawberry Nutella crepe and then a pesto crepe. The brunch special is definitely large enough to share as it comes with 2 crepes, we wanted to try more of the menu so also got an additional crepe in addition. The crepes are very good and all the ingredient tasted fresh. Definitely would come back for another weekend brunch. The service was friendly. The one thing I did not like is that they give you tiny Kirkland water bottles for water and I believe they charge 50 cents for every small water bottle. I would recommend the restaurant giving free water glasses to their guests, mainly to reduce plastic waste."
"4.0","Stopped in to this former Victorian home turned restaurant without reservation and waited only ten minutes for a table to open. This is a BYOB. Started with vegetable samosa which were delicious. Presentation was yucky with the samosa sitting on cut cabbage. Tasty naan and chicken tikka Marsala. Very reasonably priced for table service. Very attentive with water refills."
"3.0","Food was very good. However the service wasn't that great. As soon as I sat down they brought me a meal. However that meal was incorrect. (6 pc tender and mac and cheese), I ordered a 3 pc tender with fries. The woman replaced it with fries. Less than 5 minutes later I was brought out a second meal (the one I actually ordered). The server was very nice about it and told me I could keep it for the mistake. Less than 5 minutes later, she came back and apologized but she had to take the second meal I was given. I understand it's new so I'm willing to look past this plus the chicken was so good!"
"2.0","Food was good. Service was bad, they weren't busy (which says something on a Friday night at dinner) drinks which were just beers took over 20 minutes. Bunch of people working not much work being done. Food was slow (about an hour from when we ordered, but like I said they weren't busy) server didn't know how to handle slow kitchen/ bar. Instead of checking in with us regularly he went with ignoring us instead. Beautiful location. Probably won't be back unless we hear things have changed."
"4.0","Good.Items are good and tasty. Especially chilli chicken is tasty, staff are friendly. I ordered white rice with Chilli Chicken, lamb curry , chick pea curry for $9.62 . Lamb curry pieces are smooth but taste is just ok, chick pea curry is good and chilli chicken is awesome. Rice is basmati rice. I would recommend to others."
"5.0","Walked over from our hotel. Excellent food and waitress was very nice. Good prices would recommend friends there."
"3.0","Time to do another update.  I hadn't ordered from Rialto in a few years, but I was doing something last night I hadn't done in awhile.  Babysitting.  Long story.  But I knew my friends' son likes cheese pizza so I picked one up for us and I figured Rialto would be the best bet.  Not fancy.  Not great but not horrible either.  Translation:  something a five-year-old would like."
"5.0","I frequently order delivery and on occassion I stop in on my way home for take-out. Each and every time, I have a great experience, employees are very nice and the food is great. Tonight, I once again ordered delivery and decided to try the Chicken-Brocolli Alfredo for the first time. It arrived sooner than the 45 minute quote time and was wonderful. After eating my way through this awesome dish, I noticed there was no brocolli at all. I decided to call Rialto, just to let them know that the brocolli was missing. The nice gentleman appologised for my inconvenience, (even though there was no inconvenience, and the food was great). He also insisted on applying a credit to my account (which I tried to decline) and he would not hear from that. I, applaud Rialto employees for representing their business in such a professional manner. It make me want to support this establishment, and i will.Cheers,Scott (Beechwood Blvd)"
"5.0","Enjoyed EVERYTHING we got.  Very fun late night eats and the decor is funky fun.  Service was great!"
"2.0","Been here today for lunch! I'm a super fan of vegan cafes and always in search of good ones across the country. Got the famous Pangoa bowl and a Baja wrap! With extra tofu and falafel balls. The taste was just OKAY! There was more rice than actual beans and veggies. Like a thin layer of beans corns avacado cherry tomatoes that's all! If it was not for the extra falafel balls I don't think so I'd like it at all. The cafe is beautiful and in downtown. Friendly staff. Overall okay place can stop by for a quick bite."
"1.0","Absolutely horrid. Bland restless food. Wedding soup had no flavor. Pasta have no flavor. Fried ravioli bland. This place many years ago was great now it's just horrible. Pleasure bar is a lot better and they are even so so. Even Olive garden is better. What happened Alexander's? Never again"
"3.0","Good burgers! NOT many burger places I can eat at without salt on th table. Put salt on table please."
"2.0","The food at this joint is delicious.  They do most things right.  However, this is the second time that I have ordered delivery and they have screwed up my order.  The last time, they put the wrong toppings on the pizza and it took about 1.5 hours for it to arrive and then I had to wait while they re-made it from scratch.  At least they were willing to make it right.This time, the order was *totally* incorrect and still took over an hour when they are mere blocks from my house.  When I called to get the delivery driver to return, I was told that the driver made a mistake and delivered my food to the wrong location.  Their answer was...seriously...that they were going to send someone out to swap out the food they delivered to me with the food I actually ordered.  This is not only completely unsanitary (I opened the incorrect order and as far as I'm concerned contaminated it even if I didn't actually touch any of it) but at this stage I ordered pretty close to 1.25 hours ago, and  spending further time transporting the food from point A to B and then C is going to mean it's cold and/or soggy.  15 minutes later, the manager called to ask if I wanted them to re-make the food after I'd already asked for a refund.  This was the proper thing to do the first time, but it was already honestly still too late.  When expecting food in no later than 45 minutes, no one wants to spend close to two hours waiting for a resolution and then wait what could really be another 45 minutes to eat at this hour.Sorry, guys.  Your food is great, but I can't handle it twice in a row.  I might still stop in, but I'm not using you for delivery in the future."
"4.0","My review might be a bit skewed because I got to watch my Chicago Blackhawks win the 2015 Stanley Cup in this establishment, so I suppose it will forever be cemented in my heart.HOWEVER -- that said, it ended up being a great place to actually catch the game.  Pierogies were delicious. Crab dip and pita chips were tasty. Nachos were well done (with even a few burnt edges).  Yuenglings were flowing. Water was constantly refilled.  The manager obliged to make sure the game was turned on in time and stopped by to make sure our needs were met.And, of course, a special shout out to our server Megan who absolutely worked her TAIL off and offered up recommendations. She really did help make our night!"
"4.0","Good simple bar. Decent food, service was fine. Nothing to knock your socks off but an enjoyable experience and I would definitely go back."
"5.0","Business meeting over a meal.   Great food and service!  Thoroughly enjoyed my meal including crab cocktail,  NY Strip Steak and Brussels Sprouts!  Steak could have been more red for Medium Rare but still tasty!"
"5.0","Every time I go to chikn I can always count on a quick meal that's also tasty. Didn't know what to expect at first, but even with roots, piada, and chipotle nearby this restaurant sets itself apart with a great staff and an easy menu. If you're in the Oakland area looking for food this is the place to stop by."
"5.0","Perhaps we've passed our exit and there is no going back of any sorts. We are doomed to live in the outcome of a millennia of bad decisions in the name of progress. Our good fortune has timed out and the sweetness we once savored has become sour. Some belated recompense bagged up for the Tuesday night trash pickup like the fall's leaves once beautiful in their windy shuffle now just carbon breaking down in a non biodegradable bag. The only oasis in this languishing landscape is this Taco style Bell. We claim to see the patterns set before us but we contain only the capacity to fool ourselves evermore. Over sensitized and underwhelmed we wonder whimsically through this overbearing existence lacking understanding of even the simplest concepts.However often the thought of ending this thing so poorly described as 'life' crosses my miscreant mind I trudge on only knowing there is a half dozen 'SPICY POTATO TACO's and 'BAJA' style 'BLAST' in my near future. Thank you employed humans of this food station for saving my life on a bi-weekly basis. For this you will be served in great fortune in the afterlife. I will see you there."
"5.0","I loved this placed! THe vibe is amazing! If you can try to sit on the deck with instagram friendly umbrella decor. I've been here a couple times so I've tried a couple things on the menu. They even made me a smoothie that wasn't on the menu. All in all a nice place to grab a quick bite with cute decor and great service."
"4.0","Kiki Japanese Restaurant is located in Station Square, a shopping and entertainment area in Pittsburgh anchored in part by the Sheraton Hotel.  The restaurant itself is located in the middle of a dumpy mall -- there are numerous no-name stores selling Steeler's memorabilia or cheap clothing and then you see Kiki Japanese Restaurant.  Inside the place was dim, but with minimalist Japanese decor.    I took a seat at the bar, ordered an asahi and spent some time going through the menu -- it's nice to see an actual Japanese restaurant as opposed to the standard 'Asian favorites' found at some places.  Wasn't really feeling the sushi, after all this place was in the corner of a dumpy mall, so I played it safe and went with a teriyaki dish and some noodles.  Fantastic!  Who knew noodles could taste so good!  I finished every last bit of food (yes, quite a feat for me), and went back the hotel where I looked them up on-line to find they were named the best sushi in Pittsburgh in 2007.  Others labeled them 'the only real Japanese restaurant in the area.'  Moral of the story: don't be alarmed by restaurants located in seedy shopping centers."
"5.0","I just had the Quinoa Breakfast Bowl at Cafe Raymond in the Strip and it was incredibly delicious. Saut√©ed vegetables, quinoa and a sunny side up egg. It was seasoned to perfection. Whether you're a meat eater or a vegetarian, Cafe Raymond should be on your destination list. You will never be disappointed."
"5.0","Great and much needed addition to Oakland! The chicken is BOMB, Mac and cheese BOMB! Popeyes who??¬ø¬ø"
"5.0","Five stars, easily. I've been to Salem's over a dozen times and I'll never stop! Here's what I love:* FRESH grilled meats! SO MUCH flavor! So much everything! The shish tawook is my favorite, and it's perfectly grilled every time. But I also regularly stuff myself with the buffet meals. Two meats and a side on a heaping bed of rice. (SERIOUSLY heaping. The portions are massive, and I'm blissfully bloated after every Salem's binge... ahh...) I recommend the tandoori chicken and grilled chicken with saag paneer, and a side of hummus. DO get the hummus! Made fresh, in house, with a wonderful nutty flavor and none of that sabra citric acid preservative crap. Bleh. But yeah, delicious local quality flavor all around.* The sauces. Hummus, yogurt, garlic. I love them all. Does that make me basic? Yeah probably. I order extra sauce and extra pita chips (delightfully light and crispy!), and I eat up everything. This is much to the annoyance of my partner, who then has to deal with me flinging foodstuff all over the place and farting garlicky fumes through the night... but it's a worthy price to pay for the deliciousness that is Salem's :) * The people! I've only been talking about the food, but gosh the people here are so nice. Seriously, they make everybody that enters through their doors feel like a member of their family. Shoutout to Mustafa! Most contagious smile out there! I see so many families visiting for meals, groceries, parties, prayer... just everything. People depend on this space.Salem's is no longer just a restaurant to me. I mean it's also a market, obviously, but it's so much more than that too. I can't imagine a Pittsburgh without Salem's. It is a pillar of the community."
"5.0","I feel comfortable eating here. The they made a mistake one time and served me the wrong dish. But I didn't really care because the waitress was cute and the food was still amazing. ;)"
"3.0","Good atmosphere. Hate their chicken noodle soup though."
"4.0","I'm giving this place an easy 4.  A 4 1/2 is more accurate.  I had the corned beef hash and eggs. My wife had the blueberry crepe pancakes. I love places with original dishes. The crepe pancakes are really great. The corned beef hash is their own home made which is tough to find. What kept it from a 5 was that the hash is a little too salty. They should pull back on the seasoning especially since corned beef is salty already."
"3.0","Doce is... alright. However, I was thoroughly underwhelmed the three times I've come to Doce over the years. The tacos were fine, but just average and I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. I definitely feel like there are better tacos in Pgh.If it's late at night on Carson and you're hungry, you'll most likely enjoy these tacos.Also, the interior is tiny and cute."
"5.0","Big fan of this place. Stumbled in here after some adult beverages and it just hit the spot. Small menu makes things less complicating and prices are middle of the road. Everything was well seasoned and fresh. I smashed 3 tacos and was absolutely stuffed. Will be back soon."
"4.0","Three words. Birthday Cake Pudding. OMG. Salad bar. Get at it, yinz guyz! I love EnP and we go way back to my teenage days working as a hostess for my first job and then server through college. So I'm a fan for life. Now my experience is a little different because I have a toddler and I'm gluten free. Of course, it's perfect for kids and their choices are great with many options of fried mac and cheese, grilled cheese, corndogs and so much more. Now that I'm gluten free, the options are definitely slimmer for me, but I appreciate they have gluten free buns so I can still enjoy a delicious superburger. I also love any of their salads, with fries on top of course. Warning, fries are fried in the same as gluten items, but I just eat them anyway (sorry to my stomach). There's a handful of items that aren't marked gluten free that you can alter to be that way. I often get the bruschetta chicken, but grilled rather than fried. I do wish there were a handful more items to get that are GF, but I'm appreciative there are a few out there to choose from! I do hope one day they start making gluten free smiley cookies!"
"1.0","Extremely rude staff, cooks taking trash out, and over an 80 minute wait for french fries. Pizza Romano takes advantage of its customers and uber eats drivers. Oakland has MANY other quality pizza places with much nicer staff who actually cares."
"5.0","Such a nice little spot. Welcoming staff and delicious sandwiches at very affordable prices."
"4.0","Cheap, flavorful, fast tacos served counter-side in a happening part of town. We headed in around 8pm on a Friday, grabbed a parking spot right out front without an issue and grabbed three seats at the counter just the same. We ordered 3 tacos.... 2 vegetarian , 1 vegan. They were the same, just one without the Mexican farmer's cheese. Very tasty and corn is definitely the way to go for your shell. (You choose between corn or flour). We also grabbed classic Jarritos from the case for $2 a pop. My girls ate their tacos in two seconds flat, said they were so delicious and each ate two more! So yea, kiddos approved. They were good and I would recommend them for an inexpensive quick bite. My only gripe with be that they were out of avocado!!! I get that it was the end of the night, but c'mon!"
"4.0","I'm a New Yorker, so any Pizza not from NY is going to have to work pretty hard to get more than 2 stars from me. That being said, Little Nippers really shines as some of the best pizza I've had outside of NY. Their wings are also very tasty and always freshly made to order.  The staff is friendly as well, and despite my infrequent visits still remembered me."
"5.0","We checked out redbeard's after a show and had a blast! Chris was our bartender and he was super attentive and made us feel welcome... even as the bar started to clear out he didn't rush us to leave. We had great conversation and great drinks :) we would go back again anytime!"
"1.0","Done here! This place sucks. This is the third time I've had to wait over 40 minutes for a damn sandwich and this time they prepared it like shit. Management here is terrible and I have no idea how they stay in business.."
"3.0","The corned beef sandwich was fine. Forgot the coleslaw on the side - check your order if you're getting something to go. The chicken soup was excellent. Service was fast.  The atmosphere of the place is like an old bar/tavern. A good place to go if you want a quick meal to carry out Or you want to hang out with some friends with a beer and a sandwich."
"3.0","Speaking truthfully, I have never been here sober, but they do have great, cheap pizza ($4.90 for a large cheese pizza!!!!) - while it is hot that is. Like a hangover, this pizza is not something you want to deal with the next morning. It curls up and is not really edible. But great pizza when you are wasted."
"4.0","I think o could eat Mexican every day and be happy. When I heard about this new place I had to try it. The restaurant is small with s few bar stools at the front window and a few pulled up to the side of the bar. I posted pics so you could get an idea of the decor. It's colorful and lively. They have a big chalkboard that states the tacos they offer. They all looked good but I went for the Americano and the Pollo. They offer flour or corn taco shells. They have a small vintage fridge filled with sodas. They say the Americano is just like your mom makes. That might be true if your mom is Hispanic. It had seasoned ground beef, lettuce, tomatoes, shredded cheese and cream (sour cream).  The beef was seasoned well and it was a lot of meat for a taco. The shell was soft and all of the flavors melded together. It was one of the best tacos I've had (and I have had many. LOL. The Pollo (chicken) taco had the crumbling Mexican cheese, some avocado, cream along with a lime wedge. The chicken was juicy and the lime juice was perfect. Yum!!Tacos are $3 each.  For four tacos and 2 sodas it was $16. That's a cheap lunch date. That's cheap for tacos that good. They have nachos for $4, add meat and it's $5. They do a great business and are open til 3am on weekends."
"5.0","I can't say enough good things about Edgars tacos.  I am just fine sticking with the beef but the chorizo looks amazing.  2 tacos for $5 is a great deal.  The tortillas are made fresh, and the tacos come topped with onions, tomatoes, lettuce, crumbled Mexican cheese, sour cream, fresh cilantro and freshly squeezed lime juice. I could easily eat here every day. Edgar and his staff are always so friendly.  The best part is with his new location, parking is me readily available and there is a couple places to sit inside! I already can't wait to go back."
"3.0","Had food catered from Sausalido. Overall was ok. I'm not sure of the specific dish names, but I'll try to describe them.Some kind of baked chicken: Not good. Really dry, not flavorful at all. This dish alone would have been a 1 star.Salad - basic greens with garbanzo beans, tomatoes, carrots, onions, beets, and I think cranberries? I enjoyed it. Beets aren't super common in what seemed like a house salad, also liked the berries, gave it a nice contrast.Pasta salad - pretty standard, not great, not bad.Some kind of flank steak - this dish was really good actually. Really moist and flavorful. By far the best dish of everything we got. Only reason why my overall review isn't lower."
"3.0","Freshii offers a clean, fresh, and tasty approach to lunch in a location previously crowded by fast food, greasy spoons, and traditional heavy Pittsburgh signature dishes.I remember a time when the only lunch options in downtown were greasy cheese steaks, a sub shop on every corner of the downtown area, or the only accessible (via walking) lunchtime options being fine dining or fast food. Freshii finally offers clean, fresh food to professionals who want to be at the top of their game and not gorging themselves on food that will only lead to afternoon regret or food comas. Their main attraction is fresh ingredients and they cater to vegetarians and vegans. Recently they've expanded to hormone-free meat additions to their signature dishes which is a nice touch (I like a little more protein in my mid-day meal). Their options are varied and span the globe in terms of cuisine. Regardless of what you want you can get a grain, noodle, or salad bowl themed on the cuisine of your choice. Price is what you would expect for a fast food or chain these days. Expect to pay somewhere between 8 and 12 dollars for the typical meal. If you want to add fancy drink or juice you can probably add 3-5 bucks on top of that. What I will say is that what I got was 'A-Ok' (3 stars on the Yelp scale). It won't blow you away but won't disappoint you either. Freshii definitely is a better option than you would expect from the places I mentioned above and try to stay away from during lunchtime. While there are aspects they could improve on I would return for lunch if I am in the area again."
"3.0","Hmmm.... maybe I had an off night but was incredibly disappointed.Myself and 2 friends sat at the bar on a Thursday night.  We ordered drinks first, they were fine.Ordered the deviled eggs and the pancake.  Both were good, interesting flavors,  close to 4 stars.  I ordered the udon and my both ordered the tonkatsu ramen, add chili.  The udon was pretty good, 3 stars.  Knife cuts on the veg were very small so difficult to eat with a chopstick with the thick/heavier udon noodle.  One of my friends got the unagi hand roll and thought that was the best hung we ate ('bomb.com').The ramen deserves its own paragraph.  To levelset, we just got back from Japan and that is my standard. Regardless, I am beyond confused why some think this ramen is the best ramen in Pittsburgh.  The ramen broth was inedible. Basically drinking ocean water.  I guess some are considering that flavor? The meat on the bone is difficult to incorporate into the ramen with chopsticks.  It is nothing like the tonkatsu ramen we had in Tokyo and I will never be back for it.  Negative stars.  Overall giving 3 stars because appetizers were ok and our bartender did end up taking the ramen off of the menu."
"4.0","A wonderful place to catch up with friends on a Friday after a long week. Since it was a nice evening, the rooftop was open. The location is great with a beautiful view of the city and string lights. The drinks are a little pricy but worth it. A great place to take friends that are new to the city!"
"1.0","This place totally went downhill. Took 20 minutes for chips and queso and my buffalo chicken sandwich was all grisly meat. I told server and she didn't take it off the bill. Women's bathrooms not cleaned and no toilet paper in two of the stalls. Worst of all, their AC is either broken or they can't afford to electric bill with it on. Finally they opened some doors which was nice but a bunch of flies ended up at the bar with us. Won't be back."
"5.0","Best Pizza Ever!  I will admit I was skeptical about ordering bit in the end, hunger won out over skepticism.  I bit the bullet and ordered a small thick crust.  Best pizza I have ever eaten in Pittsburgh and I have eaten quite a lot of pizza.    Definitely ordering again."
"1.0","This is probably the worst Panera I have ever been to. My bagel arrived in three separate chunks, not nicely cut. I had asked for a cream cheese bagel and the bagel came without cream cheese spread on and instead little packets of cream cheese that were hard. I will never come back to this Panera. I highly recommend finding a different cafe."
"5.0","My my my I cannot find enough words to describe this place maybe because I'm stuffing my face at this moment but let me pause for just a moment. I experienced a flavor explosion - I mean from the first bite I was hooked. Food crack is what this is I'm addicted not only is the food good the environment is authentic but welcoming. You don't have to be any particular race culture or anything to enjoy this food there is something for every one. Prices are fair service is great it's a place I wished I lived closer too there is a grocery store connected and there's even an event hall Salem's deserves 6 stars. Love love love this place."
"3.0","I have a 25% love and 75% hate relationship with Panera. They make you feel like you're eating healthy when you're really not. They're hella expensive for no freaking reason. I always get the 'You Pick 2' and there's no way that half a salad and microwaved soup is $10. No way. I always avoid coming here for that reason but there's tons of tables, is in a convenient location, free WiFi and the environment can be nice. The service is always quick and they always get my order right. The 25% love is for their bakery goods. Their brownies are out of this freaking world and I know that they are baked fresh every morning. None of their other food are, even if they claim to be. Baked fresh every morning. I only come here when I feel like using my points from the Pocket Points app because then you can get BOGO You Pick 2; which makes it a little more affordable because then I have enough food to feed me for two meals. Otherwise, no way would I waste my money here."
"3.0","Not very sure why this place is hyped so much, but it was just a little over an ordinary experience for me. We went here for dinner on the day before thanksgiving. I noticed the place has a very casual vibe to it. There was only 1 waitress serving almost an entirely full restaurant, which made me feel the service isn't up to the mark.But I did enjoy the food. I really loved their complimentary bean dip and bread. The salad was wonderful too. I ordered the vegetarian pasta, and it was alright. I liked that it had a variety of fresh vegetables. Overall, I felt the prices are a bit steep, the service is not up to the mark but the food can be really good for what you order."
"2.0","FORTY MINUTE WAIT for chicken tenders and a sandwich...that should say enough. They do have good sandwiches and cheese sauce but sadly it was not worth the forty minutes waiting for food. When we got the chicken tenders, they were lukewarm. The BigWheeler was good and plenty of food at least."
"4.0","Quality food.  We enjoy the Sunday evening special. Some of our favorites are Gobi Manchurian, paneer tikka masala, the mixed tandoori plate. The staff is very friendly. The atmosphere is typical to many indian restaurants. The decor is simple."
"2.0","Nice decoration, they have the real bonsai. But the Udon surprises me a lot. The noodle is not udon, more like Chinese noodle, and soup is very salty. I have to say its far away from authentic Japanese food."
"3.0","Wow crowed!  Friday at 5 it is busy!  Have a few good beers on tap.  The service is slow, but like I said, it is crowed for happy hour!  I met a group there and we did get a table.  I will definitely give it another try for happy hour.  I would say the only part part is parking...It is down town."
"5.0","I live this place the service and dishes are the best in Bloomfield in my opinion I haven't gone anywhere else unless they are  closed and my Thai mom Somy preferres this location as we ran another Thai restaurant together for years. Thank you for all the awesome memories"
"5.0","First time eating here last night (after hearing many good reviews from friends). I had the surf and turf along with the lobster bisque (massive pieces of lobster) and it was by FAR the best I've had in the city to date!! I also had their twist on an old fashion that was mixed up by an extremely friendly/pleasant bartender Ryan.....again....amazing.....even better than my previous favorite at Butcher and the Rye. He also made a really great gin martini of some sort for my wife that she raved about.Can't wait to come back!!P.S. Was blown away that they were able to fit us in at 6:30 on a Saturday night, the restaurant was very busy but it's a big enough space that there were still a few available tables, so definitely keep this place in mind if you're in town to see a show or other event on the weekend! Everyone from the hostess I spoke to when making the reservation, to  our waiter Brian (super funny), and as previously mentioned, their bartender were soooo welcoming! The only other restaurant that I've had that vibe from is the Hartwood Restaurant in Fox Chapel.A++++"
"1.0","Worst Indian food I have ever had from restaurant. We had ordered a couple of Non Veg dishes with a couple of Veg Dishes. They conveniently forgot delivering the Vegetarian stuff.  This is definitely last order from this restaurant ...."
"5.0","Fantastic breakfast. La Prima coffee is excellent. Blueberry ricitta pancakes are great. Everything we had was delicious."
"5.0","Cinderlands has great beer and interesting bar food.We had each of the beers on tap. Our IPA friend liked the IPA and our Ale friend enjoyed the Ale. I'm not quite as picky. Each beer was good. The crowler (mini-growler can) option was nice for taking some to go if you forgot your growler or want a smaller volume to go.We only had appetizers. The scotch eggs were amazing. It was super crispy and the mustard was fantastic. It was really unexpected to see a soft boiled egg inside but really worked. If your a scotch egg person, you've got to try one.As a note, we visited once during the Lawrenceville cookie tour. They had fantastic cookies. The cookies are sadly not on the menu."
"4.0","Pamela's was my first real dining experience in Pittsburgh. I was told dozens of times by native Pittsburghians about how Pamela's hotcakes are not only a Pittsburgh staple but a White House favorite. Can't argue with that. I had the good fortune of sampling both the banana chocolate chip hotcakes as well as the banana walnut hotcakes--the former is by far superior, even if you're a nut fiend like yours truly. Perfectly crisped around the edges and delectably moist and sweet, the crepes are loaded with melted chocolate and banana slices. I will shamelessly admit to eating two orders... by myself. However, the rest of the offerings at Pamela's are your typical diner fare, average at best. Come here for the hotcakes, then go home and sleep it off. Your day is done.*Pamela's is cash-only and extremely busy on weekends. (On weekdays, service is surprisingly brisk.)*I recommend the Shadyside or Squirrel Hill locations over the one in Oakland."
"4.0","Met-up there with friends visiting from out-of-town & had a good time.  The atmosphere is 'industrial' so casual is the dress code.  We took advantage of some of the Happy Hour specials on drinks 'bar food'.  I think the Shrimp Cocktail was one of those specials & it was quite good.There were several large shrimp that were served with lemon wedges & very tasty cocktail sauce.  Having eaten a large (for me) lunch that day, a full main course wasn't the way to go, so I ordered another appetizer - fish tacos (I think they were tilapia) which were also very good.  The beer was as cold as any I can recall, which was really great on a hot/humid summer evening.  My guests were also very pleased, ordering sushi & a whole lobster, respectively.  The service throughout the time was fine, on a somewhat quiet Wednesday evening. I did make a reservation using a system called 'Open Table' as I didn't know in advance how busy it might have been.  As it happened, the reservation wasn't necessary.  Afterward, Open Table sent me a few follow-ups for me to rate everything, which I ignored; that was the only slight negative to the visit.  Parking on the street was free since we began at 6:00pm, so no problem there.  An all-around good experience."
"5.0","I've always had great food and service at Cafe Raymond. My favorite is the tomato mozzarella salad in a wrap... delicious!!"
"5.0","I love this eatnpark! We come here all the time because of the friendly staff and fresh tasting food. I actually live closer to the west liberty location but we will drive a little further because this one is way better, we haven't had a bad experience yet!"
"1.0","I checked out their menu online prior to taking an Uber to get there as I was visiting the city from out of town. Upon arrival, I see a totally different menu than what was advertised online. When I showed the menu online to the staff, he said they changed the menu for the weekend and I could not order from their regular menu. ALL of the items were listed for twice as much as what was listed online. Stay away from these crooks!"
"5.0","The egg and cheese breakfast sandwich changed me. A spiritual experience."
"3.0","Excellent service and my chicken taco was outa this world.  Everythin was so fresh and prices were good.   The salsa had the zing that I look for. I will no doubt be heading back.  Thank you Edgar Tacos Stand!"
"4.0","On of my campus favorites, I usually get either the falafel panini or the 3 cheese panini both are delicious. Their fries are exquisite, they are breaded and seasoned adding a nice flavor to it. I like to ask for the beta bites dressing on the side as well because the sauce is very flavorful and a perfect pairing to dip your fries in. Only issue I've had here is that there is a $0.75 charge if you pay with credit card, but this can be compensated if you are a Pocket Points user and you redeem a 20% off menu item coupon."
"4.0","I'm not a steak eater but I love it here.  We make it a point to come here at least once a year for the Generous Pour, which is a very generous sampling of up to 8 wines for $38 with the cost of a meal.  This year there were 3 whites and 5 reds.  I sampled them all, and they were all delicious.   Then you can request unlimited refills of your favorites!  How can you beat that?!I also love the service here.  Your wait staff is attentive and friendly and very knowledgeable about the food and the wines.  I could eat an entire bowl of just the mashed potatoes.  Creamy and delicious, I'm sure they are full of butter and cream (a fact that I choose to ignore).  I always opt for a fish dish for my main course and everything is good, although outdone by the aforementioned mashed potatoes.  I also tried the cheesecake with fresh berries and it was to die for.  Believe me, it's worth the cost!"
"4.0","Beautiful location, service, The Best and absolutely Best Old Fashion I have had but for the price I expected nothing less! The Server was an expert at his craft and knowledge of the wine combinations with the meal - The Meal was good! I mean it was Good! But again it maybe just me... It wasn't something I would  miss if it closed! Nothing stood out as a unique character of taste! It was good but for the Price it should! I think as a consumer your looking for that combination of great food, reasonable price and location decor. It's a Grand Place for that Special occasion"
"5.0","This place is amazing!!! By far the cleanest and nicest sports bar in Pittsburgh. Was there football Sunday with some friends and WOW!! What a place! Wings were great! Servers were great! Had 3 different managers come and talk to us, 2ladies and a big guy, all three were very professional and seemed to be very caring and having fun. Great senses of humor we teased them bout saying y'all instead of yins they were super friendly. Beer was cold, plenty of tv's both upstairs and downstairs. We will for sure be back! It's great to see a crew that smiles and has fun and that all the managers were having fun and smiling also the place was very busy and yet everyone talked to us. Other places need to take a chapter out of Redbeards book, they do it right!! Can't wait for next visit probably going for their ugly Christmas sweater party seems like fun! See 'y'all' soon Redbeards!"

"4.0","I'm always looking for a cute tea shop! I can't believe it's taken me this long to stumble across Arnold's. The menu is overwhelming! I think they may have the largest selection in Pittsburgh. You'll need a few minutes to make a selection. Have questions? Ask they staff. They're happy to make recommendations and let you smell any tea you're considering. I stuck with an old favorite - the chai tea latte - can't say it's the best latte I've had, kind of wish I stuck with a regular loose leaf tea to start. They also serve wraps, soups, and salads. They cafe is really spacious. It's the perfect place to work or meet up with a friend. You'll find a number of different seating options. Fingers crossed on my next visit the fire place is on!"
"5.0","Hardee's has great food! They offer great breakfast food like the Loaded Omelet Biscuit, a omelet with crumbled sausage, bacon, ham and cheddar cheese stacked on a buttermilk biscuit. Texas Toast Breakfast sandwiches, your choice of sausage, bacon or ham stacked with egg & cheese on Texas toast. A cinnamon raisin biscuit, a baked cinnamon raisin biscuit topped with icing. They also offer breakfast bowls, biscuit sandwiches, croissant sandwiches with your choice of bacon, ham or sausage and much more. They also have great burgers! You can get them in 1/3 lb, 1/4 lb a 2/3 lb versions like the Grilled Cheese Bacon Thickburger, a charbroiled burger covered with bacon, melted Swiss and American cheese, and mayo on grilled sourdough bread. Your other 1/3 lb burger choices are the Cheeseburger Thickburger, the Original Thickburger, the Mushroom 'N' Swiss Thickburger, the Bacon Cheese Thickburger and the Low Carb Thickburger. 1/4 lb burger choices are the Grilled Cheese Bacon Thickburger and the Little Thickburger. They also offer a 2/3 lb. Monster Thickburger as well! They also offer fried chicken, chicken tenders, chicken and fish sandwiches and kid's meals. Be sure to save room for dessert! They offer ice cream malts and shakes in berry, chocolate, vanilla and strawberry!"
"3.0","Came here for Sunday dinner. Overall, not bad. The best Indian I've had in Oakland so far. They had some nice variety in the menu, but we stuck with their dinner special which had more typical offerings. We tried the malai kofta and paneer tikka masala. They were both good. The service was nice, if a little bit slow. The mango lassi was delicious. We'd come back when in the area and try the  dosa or some of the creative ideas (Indian shrimp? Interesting, and worth a try) but our go to Indian will still be Udipi Cafe."
"1.0","Sloppy service!!!  Spoke to Mgr Philip he did care and was NO help!!!  I told him the prep cook was eating while prep fooding the meat and cheese plates . I was furious as waitress took our order but never put it into system until she took a party of 10 order.  The food was not special I would never return."

"3.0","The veggie pizza was amazing! But the person at the register was kind of rude. And by the looks of it, two of my family members didn't like their food, anyway. This place was......eh."
"5.0","Awesome cheese steak!  Great apps!  I would say you should go during happy hour for drink specials. The menu is pretty basic, but all the food is well made and affordable."
"3.0","This location is ok. I really like the one downtown so much better. Pizza was cooked too long making it difficult to chew the crust. Not worth complaining because the toppings were still fresh and tasty."
"5.0","Came here a few weeks ago while I was in Pittsburgh and it was absolutely wonderful. It's run by a local Turkish family that are all super super nice and friendly. They open early and have a lot of choices of seating. I sat on the back patio which was off the street and nice and quite and had such cute decorations with the umbrellas and yard things. My waiter was very friendly and I ordered first an iced chai tea latte that was delicious with just the right amount of cinnamon on top. I then ordered a ham and Brie crepe for my meal that came with a side salad that was delicious! I was content when I left but stayed a while I read my book. Staff didn't rush me out or anything which was nice so I got to take my time sipping and eating. Would love to come here again and try something else off of their wonderful menu!"
"5.0","My favorite tacos in Pittsburgh! Nice portion sizes and a great price. The sauces are all delicious. I like to get the Dino bowl, and the pork is probably my favorite. It is in South Side so it's a popular drunk food spot."
"5.0","My favorite spot in Pittsburgh. Great corn beef sandwich, nice atmosphere, great bartender. Over all, a better vibe than any other downtown bar /grill I visited! The bartender keeps a 2014 Almanac Book of Facts, to settle any dubious claims from any tall tale telling patron."
"2.0","I am a pretty easygoing guy. I would've overlooked the fact(s) that:1. Jim Beam is your only bourbon. 2. For some reason two drinks came out to $9.90.* 3. Even with only 10 people in the bar, the music was absolutely deafening. 4. You charge a $3 cover for no discernible reason.5. Rolling blunts is apparently kosher inside the bar, but sharing, not so much.However, I can't let this slide: your claw machine is BULLSHIT. That is the weakest claw of all time, and there's no chance it is EVER picking up anything in that cage. I feel violated, and I want my dollar back. ___________*I think that's some sort of weird PA tax thing."

"3.0","The make it quickly and the price is good. 2 times was enough for me to pass on a 3rd. The cheese and sauce are not the best. I hope they can make some improvements as it's close and I would love to have a good shop close."
"4.0","Good food, good drinks/selection, but the lady making the food was absolutely miserable"
"2.0","I was so looking forward to this place and while my meal was okay, I'll explain why I am only giving this 2 stars. When I first walked in I noticed that it was smokey, and it stayed smokey the entire time I was there. It was really distracting. Next comes the service. While our server was friendly, the time that it took for our drinks to come out was ridiculous. And it wasn't all that crowded there, plus we had made reservations so it's not like we just stopped in. We ordered appetizers at the same time as our drinks and those took even longer to come out. And then when they did come out, our meals came out less than 10 min later. So we were still eating the apps, there wasn't enough room on the table for everything. We consolidated the plates on our own big they never came and picked up the dirty plates. And speaking of the table, the actual height of the table was way too high for the chairs. I felt like a little kid eating at the adult table. Lastly, we told our server we had a coupon from Yelp for a free appetizer. I had checked in and had 4 hours to use the coupon. I showed her my phone and she clicked redeem now and then immediately clicked the mark as used button. So she didn't get the code or whatever she needed for the free app. I tried to explain that I couldn't check back in (because Yelp won't let you within a certain time period) but she didn't know what she was doing and I just said forget about the coupon. As for my meal, I had the sea bass which was a special. It was very tasty but others in my party did not like their meals. And I tried everyone else's, they were just okay. Also, while I did not go to the restroom, others in my party did and said it was dirty and there were no paper towels. I am a pretty generous reviewer. It really takes a lot for me to have a poor experience but this was really just disappointing."
"4.0","Soooo good. The mocha French toast and fig and brie were delicious. Not overly sweet and I liked that they give you the option of ordering a single slice so you can try a few things. I also got the mushroom and Gouda omlette which was a decent serving size. The salad and the dressing were good. The service was great, the waitress gave suggestions, the food came out quick and was warm. We also got the Nutella banana crepe to go and it was yum! Would definitely recommend"
"5.0","I have just one word to describe this pizza and that is.....OMGYUM (that's a word, right?) They were parked outside a brewery we were at one night, so we gave them a whirl. You really can't go wrong with wood-fired pizza, but this 'za is some of the best around. We split a 'White Boy' pie, which comes with a few different cheeses, fresh garlic, and fresh herbs (basil, rosemary, oregano). The pizza's simplicity really let the ingredients shine....the sharpness of the pecorino cheese melded perfectly with the slightly-sweet garlic and the earthy herbs. The crust was done to perfection and had just an ever-so-slight hint of smokey flavor from the wood-burning oven. 10/10 would eat again! :)"
"2.0","Food fair at best. Phili steak bun so dry and old. Lettuce yellowed on quesadilla. Beer expensive. Won't be back. Expected better for price"
"1.0","They say they close at 10:00 pm. We (a group of 4) went there at 9:23 pm yesterday and we were told the kitchen is already closed, even for take out too. Went to a nearby Indian restaurant and had an awesome food there."
"2.0","Sorry guys but was really shocked uncharacteristically on the reviews vs the actual experience here. It's rare that yelp ever leads me wrong, but this is not a 4 or even 3 star sushi experience. Service was very nice from Wait staff. Food was downright poor. I had their Sashimi dinner and the portions we small, the assortment poor and the quality mediocre. Really a sad Tamago (egg custard) on a Sashimi plate? I even had to ask where the listed salmon was for it to be added back on the plate. If not for the pleasant wait staff, this would be a 1 for my first time on yelp. Skip it and find another."
"4.0","Cool chicken shop on Forbes ave... I got the tenders twice so I just like them.. The first time I got one huge tender that was almost like a breast so if u don't like huge tenders you can order small ones.. I did that second time and it was better.. The chicken is fresh and the breading is good.. The ranch/chipotle sauce that comes with it taste more on the mayo side, don't like that much... but the chicken tenders and pickles I'll def be going back!"
"5.0","Really great taco spot in South Side. It's small in size, but it definitely delivers. I ordered the pollo and carne molida tacos (chicken and beef) on corn tortillas and they were absolutely delicious. There was only one person working when we ordered, so we waited about 10 minutes for our tacos from the time we arrived. The chef was quick and would often fill three orders at once. With a steady flow of customers, I thought his timeliness was quite impressive. No one was left waiting for long at all.If you're looking to order the daily special, they ran out around 6 PM even though this taco shop is open until midnight during most week days.I will definitely be returning, and I recommend this spot to anyone looking for delicious tacos around Pittsburgh!"
"5.0","I love this place: that's the first time I see many differents types of dumpling in one place. I had bacalao with potatoes and many types of different dumplings. Everything was very delicious!! Customer service is also awesome. I really recommend this place for lunch or snack time."
"5.0","My friends and I celebrated a birthday at Jerome Bettis' Grille and we had a wonderful time! There was 16 of us and they were so nice about accommodating us and it didn't take long for us to get a table. Our waiter, Brian, was wonderful and brought us anything we needed!We all started off with drinks - margaritas, mojitos, mixed drinks and drafts! The appetizers were great, especially the nachos! For our meals, a few people had the southwest club, that they said was delicious! I had the Black and Bleu burger and it was great! I would definitely go back and like to try the deep fried hoagie. That looked really good!"
"5.0","Capital always does such a nice job, I've honestly never had anything except a great experience here. I normally prefer to sit in the bar/lounge area, but most recently had dinner in the dining room, which turned out to be a better choice bc the bar was PACKED. Our server, Matt, was great- the service was intuitive and playful. He recommended and accommodated as needed. Everything is always delicious, obviously steak is their specialty.... but another highlight is the lobster mac n cheese, its amazing! Also, try the Stoli Doli cocktail, it's their signature. But go easy, it's stronger than it tastes! All in all, It's a high end chain steakhouse, right, and in a city filled with so many unique & independent places you might not think of Capital, however, it's predictably excellent and you won't be disappointed."
"3.0","This is an older retail store.  I normally have a loving relationship with Eat 'n Park, but this one just didn't hit home for me.  I came during the Sunday Brunch Buffet; my friend partook, I abstained after seeing the fare.  I ordered two eggs over-easy with a side of toast.  Getting beyond the murky, dated feel of the store, it was actually fairly clean on the interior and in the restrooms.  I received my food and the eggs were cooked perfectly.  Maybe not a big deal for some, but you would be surprised at how often over-easy comes out over-hard or, worse, uncooked.  I think the real reason I enjoy Eat 'n Park most of the time is the normal salad bar items."
"4.0","Need to send a gift basket to a foodie ... buy local ... buy Merante's.While taking your order you are quizzed on the recepient.   Need a general Italian basket or a true Italian basket .... big difference in goodies.  Highly recommend.  They deliver.  I have never been disappointed."

"5.0","Good doesn't describe this place, Fabulous does, the food was just that very well presented and cooked. My granddaughter was treated to a special desert plate  for her upcoming dance.  I can't say enough about Margie the server, she was such a delight and so attentive.  She made our dinner even better with her delightful personality, we just loved her. Our steaks were cooked to perfection and the Tuna perfect.This is my first visit here and I won't soon forget it..Thank you Margie for making our dinner so wonderful..and to the chefs that made our dishes..."
"2.0","Got there when it opened, I was not looking for much, just a hearty breakfast. I had bacon and eggs with 2 pancakes. The eggs were fine, (cooked the way I requested). The bacon ok (a bit on the thin sliced side) wished it was thicker and better quality.. The pancakes were by far the worst I have EVER been served. Two of the flattest, greasiest, awful pancakes I have ever seen they were as thin as construction paper and tasted about the same.  On the bright side, I found the service pretty good, the waitress was quick with a refill of your drink, and the food was out pretty quickly.. I would have given it 3  stars if the pancakes were better, but they were really, really bad...."
"5.0","I get the #7 roethlisburger every time I'm in the strip.  It never seems to disappoint.  There is tons of sports memorabilia and history in this place. I definitely recommend it."
"3.0","Was looking forward to a trip to Mezzo as Sienna on the Square is one of my fav Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh and this is essentially a sister. The service started out poor and continued throughout. Based on my observation it appeared they were understaffed for the crowd as our waiter had numerous tables. We were going in advance of a show and after we waited 22 minutes to get our waiter's attention after our reservation/seating time, we were finally able to order drinks for the table, along with food. My husband and I arrived earlier than the other couple and he ordered a drink which took nearly 15 minutes.  We made it clear to our waiter that we were going to an 8pm show so after waiting 22 minutes for any attention, we'd need to be accommodated. We were quickly told too bad and that everyone in the restaurant was going to the show. We finally received our entrees at 7:46pm (or reservation was at 6:30) which meant we were forced to shovel the food into our mouths. It was a damn shame because we all agreed our dishes were outstanding. This is the only reason they received any stars. Kuddos to the kitchen. Front of house needs to get their act together. I don't think this was the fault of our waiter but poor management of the wait staff. The wait staff were working their tails off for basically a bunch of unhappy people."
"3.0","I've been wanting to come here for a while because I've heard really good things from my mom. When I went here Saturday we were greeted by the manager who seemed very friendly. However after we got seated we had a very mean old lady as our waitress. She gave us a feeling like we weren't welcome. Maybe she was right. We were in our 20s and  the majority of the clientele was over 60. While the service may not have been to our liking, the food was pretty good. I had the tortellini verde which I liked but I enjoyed my girlfriends penne in their Gorgonzola sauce more."
"5.0","One of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. I frequently have Silver Palace deliver food to me and I have dined in before. I love the food (especially the curry chicken) and the staff is genuinely friendly."
"4.0","Service was good, the restaurant was nicely decorated and clean/modern. We would've expected more memorabilia from the steelers in there. The prices were reasonable for what you received. The Peorogi flatbread was delicious. The buffalo chicken sandwich wasn't anything special, but the grilled cheese was good. TL;DR good restaurant, would go again."
"4.0","I'm a food snob.  Hanging around San Francisco for the last 5 years will do that to a person.  In addition, being a pescetarian (vegetarian + fish), its not exactly easy to find new places for really good food.  I'm so glad to see a place like this.  Bread was served with fantastic oil/balsamic/white bean dip.  YUM!  The salads had an amazing fresh strawberry dressing.  For my entree, I enjoyed crabcakes with mushroom risotto.  My only complaint is that the risotto had too much cracked pepper in it and I kept coughing during my meal.  I'll definitely be back."
"4.0","This is my go-to for good, unpretentious, Italian-American home cooking. Alexander's is  the place where the locals go for an inexpensive meal. The dining room is small and decorated to look like an Italian trattoria. The menu has all the basics, tons of pastas, different sauces, meatballs, parmigiana, etc. The bread is from (I'm pretty sure) Mancini's which is an old Italian-American bakery in the city. Come as you are: jeans, Steelers jersey, college sweatshirt, what have you. The service can be a bit flaky, but everyone is quite nice. Just relax. If they mix up an order they'll make it right. I love the wedding soup here and they make awesome chicken piccatta. I also like how they serve the meat and pasta dishes separately on small plates, instead of dumping everything together on a big dinner plate. For dessert they make a real tiramisu with lots of rum, and also really good rice pudding. One warning: it is really easy to overeat here. I eat lightly during the day if I know I'm going to Alexander's for dinner."
"5.0","Great food and drinks.  Service is always great and fast.  This is out downtown happy hour spot."
"5.0","My favorite Thai spot in the city. I eat here regularly. Great staff, great food, great prices. I recommend their Chiang Mai Mee, Pad Kee Mao, or any of their curries. Their lemongrass soup is also unlike any place else, and you get a cup of it plus a spring roll with your lunch entree! The Thai iced tea is also great. Delicious!"
"5.0","Yes, it's a chain. But man, is it incredible! The amazing Jonathan D. took me to TCG for a birthday lunch today where I enjoyed their combo lunch of Butternut Squash Bisque, Lobster Roll and Parmesan/Truffle Fries. He had the Wagyu Mushroom burger and seemed very pleased with it. For ~$20/each it truly doesn't get any better. In addition, the pre-meal bread was so fresh out of the oven, it was actually too hot to touch. Our server Tina noticed that I opened a gift before the meal, assumed it was my birthday, and provided us with dessert afterwards. What service!!! True - it isn't for everyday meals, but I say a special occasion can be a random Tuesday, so treat yourself!"
"4.0","I really enjoyed the ambiance here.  The setting in an old house with original trim was really lovely.  I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and garlic Naan with Mango Lassi.  The spices were just right and the portions were decent for the price.  The mango lassi was very sweet and tasty, if a little warm, but overall still yummy."
"4.0","I give this 4 star review though I have only eaten two things there the pizza and the bread sticks,( great deal for large cheese with breadsticks... I give him a twenty)and I have either eaten them black out drunk or really hung over the next day.Let's face it pizza is like sex, when it's good it's good and when it's bad, it's still pretty good.  This pizza is no different from any other take out pizza place. Though I think they put yogurt in thier dough (just a guess, I'm not very clear headed when I eat this). They deliver until late I want to say 2am but I really dont look at the clock and the pizza, at least in my mind, arrives instantaneously the delivery man is always happy and always has an accent and I wanna ask where he's from but my drunk self usually thinks it will be rude.Overall it's a great place to get pizza at 2am from. I will never order it when I'm sober for the simple fact that I do not want to mess with a good thing"
"5.0","I've been to the Oakland location 3 times in the past 6 weeks, and it is incredible! It's a great atmosphere and the food is delicious. You might want to make a reservation because it's a small restaurant."
"5.0","Fireb pizza with a tremendous amount of toppings to go around... my favorite is the gluten free not because I'm allergic but it's a little thicker than the other options with a delicious chew to it when u bite down.. staff are great and they don't burn pizzas like the downtown location.. highly recommended"
"5.0","This is a great, local pizza shop. The pizza and hoagies are fresh and flavorful. I live close by and this is my go to place, through they will pretty much deliver anywhere in the city. There are always coupons for this place and even if you don't have any you can ask over the phone and they will usually give you a deal. They always say it will take 45 mins for delivery but in my experience it's usually about 20-30 mins. Prices seem to be totally random since the same order comes out to a different price every time but I guess that's part of the charm."
"5.0","Food really tasty! You should stop by and order a sandwich or a panini. I tried them both. Very delicious!"
"5.0","You know, I Looooove Peppi's. Something about their signature subs just tastes soooo good. I suggest you check out the New Yorker with double meat. And they reheat surprisingly well too! I'd honestly suggest this place as a Pittsburgh sandwich icon over Primanti's any day."
"4.0","You have to know what you're looking for to find it, like all things in life.The door is around the corner from a large bar, with a sign that's more of a Japanese stamp than indicator of what's within.  You must be able to climb 2 flights of stairs (not ADA friendly at all), and as you go up the narrow stairs, you feel transported to a Shinjuku nightclub. It's loud and the dj's at the end of the bar are skilled. So loud that I couldn't hear the hostess or my waitress, but they are willing to get up close and talk right in your ear. They only have high tops, which I always hate because the angle makes my feet dangle and my thighs fall asleep. But...Their food is extraordinary. I over ordered because I couldn't decide. They had a thick okonomiyaki filled with big chunks of pork and broccoli- unusual filling for traditional okonomiyaki, but delicious. There were fat slices of grilled eggplant topped with ground chicken that were creamy and fresh in the best ways. Personally I thought the eggplant was a bit thick to deal with given that the chicken was juicy and the whole thing difficult to eat with chopsticks, but it was so good flavor and presentation wise. The outstanding winner for me was the delicate egg custard, savory and mushroom filled. It reminded me of a superb homemade silky tofu with lots of flavor in that creamy little pot.Overall they have a great chef in the kitchen, and a warm, thumping vibe in front."
"5.0","Hands down the best sushi I have ever eaten. It will definitely be difficult for me to eat sushi at any other restaurant. Definitely try Kiku if you are looking for high quality and delicious sushi."
"4.0","I must preface that I am from California and my expectations of tacos are high. So with that said, I gave them four stars because because a restaurant is rated on more than food.The layout of the space is very nice and I love the esthetic. Now let's get to the meat and potatoes...The best taco that I tried was the pork. The meat was flavorful and the profile of flavors was very nice. I had it on corn and it went well. Their corn shells are a bigger and thicker than most street tacos.Now, I tried both beef tacos and they were good but not the best I've ever had obviously but for Pittsburgh they are good. Now when I saw beef I immediately think carne asada or something in that range and they just serve regular ground beef. I feel they put to many toppings on the tacos and it gets away from the flavor.I didn't taste the chicken because I'm not a fan of chicken tacos but according to my boyfriend it was good. Also, I think that trying their tacos on flour may be better but it will be my reasoning for going back.Overall, I'd patron again but not with the expectations of being blown away but of having a decent taco"
"2.0","I will start that I wanted to give 0 stars, but the food was good, so 2 stars is what I'll settle on. It's a Friday evening during march madness, bar is practically empty with about 2 tables full and people sitting on one side of the bar. We go to the bar, grab the 4 chairs open at one end of the bar and the pens game is starting. I ask the bartender to put the pens game on one of the 3 televisions on our side of the bar which I am told 'the tvs are staying the way they are. It's march madness'. 4 seats open at the other side of the bar and we have to move so I can watch the pens game. Miraculously the pens game is now put on a tv from the side we had to move from.  I will not be returning to this place!!"
"1.0","I hate to leave a bad review. But...  we were there on Sat. Made a reservation. Got there on time. The place was packed. It is a small place with minimal ventilation. We were seated and ordered food almost immediately. The waitress was a total space cadet.  Not ONCE she asked if we needed anything including very much needed water in this crammed poorly ventilated room.  We made the crucial mistake to order pork chop. This took more than  1.5 hours. I left for a little time to move outside and breathe. Meanwhile we had to literally hunt someone down for a water refill. After an hour, we were told that pork chops took at least 45 min. I add that we got salad that is part of the meal. One was served in a bowl. One in a small ice cream cup!  The salad consisted of dressing with some salad stuff in it and the bowl was totally dirty.  Once food arrived, I really couldn't breathe. So we asked for the check. It arrived but we were charged for the wrong meal which was $4 more expensive that what I ordered..chicken. I couldn't take it.  So we bailed out.  We also observed similar frustrations on all the nearby tables. Including a charred steak that was not edible.  Food was only ok."
"1.0","Il Tetto- should be Ewl Tetto. Our first time to Pittsburgh and we stopped here after we left the Mexican place next door (which is so good btw) anyways. Service: well you better hope not to get Olivia  she was horrible. She could care less, was so rude, and at the end threw our check (literally threw) read my other reviews I am super honest. She threw it and said have a good day. Ugh, Olivia happy Friday to you. I get people have bad days but common. Now on to the drinks, HORRIBLE. Not sure worth the money."
"4.0","I order from Rialto frequently and the food is consistently good. Fantastic Italian hoagie and buffalo chicken pizza. Delivery service is always good. The only reason I'm not giving this neighborhood joint 5 stars is because of the downright rude guy answering the phone. After today's super condescending interaction, I'm looking around for other options, which is a bummer because the food is good, prices are right and it's super convenient:-("
"5.0","Thanks, Caffe Mona for a great breakfast, cute atmosphere, and kind staff. I had the breakfast crepe and my husband had the Elvis crepe. Both were great and paired with a excellent, strong cup of coffee."
"4.0","I stopped by here with my wife on a Friday night for date night. This place caught my eye because they have an incredibly interesting menu that sounds healthy, fresh, and seasonal. After fighting Pittsburgh and Lawrenceville Friday traffic we were able to find an on street parking spot a block away from the restaurant. Inside had a nice romantic feel with some mood lighting. The entire restaurant is tiny so I'd recommend reservations just to be on the safe side. Being BYOB with a $2/person corkage fee, my wife and I brought along a bottle of chardonnay to be fancy n'at. We were quickly seated upon arrival and our wine was opened and placed in a bucket of ice while we had a chance to look over the menu. I ended up picking the salmon with quinoa summer salad, and before our main dishes came out we were treated to a beautiful fresh salad with beats and a creamy rosemary (I think it was rosemary) dressing as well as a roasted red pepper and humus dip with balsamic dressing and freshly baked bread to dip. My wife is not a humus fan and had a fair helping of the dip, enough said. The salmon was excellent and the quinoa salad was a nice pairing minus the strawberries which I'm not sure fit that well with the dish. Either way it was great and my wife who ordered the duck which came with potatoes and a fall cooked apple side also tasted very good. The sweetness of the apple complimented the rich flavor of the duck. We spent a good 2 hours here for dinner. I very much enjoyed the date, sipping on wine the whole time and eating basically a 3 course meal. The staff was very friendly and I think we'll be back here sometime even though Lawrenceville isn't easy to get to. Great place for a nicer date!!!"
"5.0","I work a block away from Salem's, and I eat there twice a week.  Don't be fooled by the cheap, cafeteria style seating - everything at Salem's is incredible, whether you want a burger and fries, or more traditional Indian/Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food.  They have a large menu (posted above the counter) to order from, as well as about 20 feet of hot food waiting to be dished up from the counter.  Vegetarians have options such as vegetable curry, spinach, chickpeas, and hummus, but if you're like me, you want some meat!  Go ahead and try a lamb gyro, beef gyro, or some chili chicken.  They also have a great beverage selection, if you're into specialty sodas, juices, milks, or Snapple.Salem's isn't the classiest joint in the strip, but like I said, I'll take it multiple times a week!  The prices are great when you consider how large the serving sizes are, but healthy eaters can get smaller dishes as well."
"2.0","I was really looking forward to try this place but sadly I was very disappointed. The service is nice and friendly but the quality of food unfortunately is very low.  Lots of canned processed food and not fresh vegetables.  I was not even able to eat my food because it tasted like leftover food. Other people in our party were somewhat more satisfied so I might have picked the worst options on the menu but overall very underwhelming quality of food"
"2.0","Food is pretty good, sometimes meat is hard. The service is hit or miss. But this guy in the picture did not greet me when I walked up but smiled like a Cheshire Cat while greeting the Pittsburgh police officer that walked in to order. Another customer who was waiting was more pleasant towards me than the cashier. Also appeared to have an attitude bc I didn't immediately hear him ask for my name over the intensely loud rock music an other customers yelling. Meanwhile there was only ONE other person waiting for food. This is what I mean by service is hit or miss. Usually miss."
"5.0","Every single dish served to our party of five was excellent. The restaurant was almost empty due to the Penguins hockey game that night, so I don't know what it's like when the restaurant is busy but we will definitely return.  The meat dishes (hanger steak and French cut pork chop) were melt in your mouth and saucy flavorful. The Pan seared duck was pretty tender and moist, and the crab cakes (always risky away from the coast) were delicious!  Appetizers were awesome:  smoked Gouda, crostini, and eggplant - subtle smoky. Service was friendly and helpful. There was no separate gluten free menu but I did fine (note that I am not allergic). We skipped dessert but loved the La Prima fresh brewed coffee. We'll be back. There's a public inexpensive parking lot on Cedarville just three short easy walking blocks away."
"5.0","I can't get enough of this place! The service is fast and the food is absolutely fantastic-my favorite is the chocolate and banana hot cakes."
"2.0","The sampler platter was very small for the price tag. Staff was good and payed.attention to the customers"
"3.0","The food was eh to average, but the atmosphere after a Steelers win over them nasty bengals was fantastic. Nice beers though.  Plenty of other good food restaurants we could've eaten at.  But we can say we ate at The Bus' place!!"
"3.0","I think this place is very over rated. My omelet wasn't cooked well, the eggs weren't even beaten the whole way. It came with smoked gouda and it was just two thick slices I side of the omelette... the cheese wasn't even warm... like, they cooked the omelette, then added the cheese. I was holding my coffee and when I went to let it go, it stuck to my hand because of how dirty the cup was. They also make you pay for tiny water bottles... I like to drink a lot of water, and had I known that is have to pay for it, i would have brought my own. The waiter offered me a new coffee but I declined because I just wanted to leave. He went to grab the check and came back with dessert, which was thoughtful and delicious... but that was the only part of my breakfast that I even enjoyed. I doubt I'll come back here. I had much higher hopes based on the many photos and rave reviews."

"3.0","I love the atmosphere at Il Tetto. It is a great spot to hang out after work and have a few beers with the co-workers. However, I'm giving il Tetto three stars because of the not so great prices/appetizers and awkward ID process.   A few of my co-workers held a happy hour at Il Tetto for me to celebrate my move to a different department. I was actually running late....I know late to my own happy hour....and as soon as the elevator door opened I hopped off, saw my co-workers waving me over, and proceed to hurry on over. Well, I totally forgot about their awkward ID process. You have to actually hand a 'bouncer' your ID As soon as you get off the elevator. I forgot to do this since I was in a rush to get over to my co-workers. Well, i shouldn't have forgotten.... The 'bouncer' rushes up behind me and touches me on the shoulder to get my attention. This was totally awkward and uncomfortable. I understand it is their process, but maybe he could have let me set my things down and been a bit more relaxed in how he asked for my ID. just a suggestion. Another thing I'm not too crazy about is the menu. They don't have the best beer selection for the prices. I paid almost $6 for one yuengling summer wheat beer. I drank imported German beer for $6 in a bar in NYC (this was a rare find, I know). But, still... $6 for a yuengling and it wasn't even a craft beer. Next, I do not care much for the food options/prices. One of the appetizers was $18!"
"5.0","When I think of a classic lunch, I usually think of sandwiches and salads. Caf√© Raymond has arguably some of the best sandwich and salad options in the Strip District, and they have breakfast, too! I haven't had the pleasure of having their breakfast yet, but I can definitely see it in my future.My mom came down to meet me for lunch last week, and knowing she's a big fan of club sandwiches I suggested Caf√© Raymond. She threw me for a loop and got a burger, and she said she was in more of a burger mood on this particular day. I opted for the veggie wrap, being that Thanksgiving was just two weeks ago and I felt like I needed something a bit healthier, to say the least. I learned during my first visit that it's a good idea to opt for potatoes rather than the regular chips that come alongside a sandwich because they're delicious! Our food arrived quickly and the portion sizes were good. My mom's burger was so juicy and the bun looked incredibly soft, and to a person that isn't big on beef burgers it looked amazing. My wrap was also great, and I loved all the roasted veggies and the pesto oil that pulled it all together. Our meals even with the small upcharge for potatoes was still just over $20 for the two of us, which isn't bad at all for lunch.The first time I visited Caf√© Raymond, I got the special which was a pulled pork grilled cheese. I'm not sure how often specials change, but I was sure glad I ordered it this time! My sandwich was huge and had more pork than cheese on it, and the pork was juicy and covered in BBQ sauce.. I've never had a bad experience out of the couple times I've visited Caf√© Raymond, and I'm excited to come back in the future!"
"1.0","If you're looking for the worst pizza in Western Pennsylvania, this is the winner.  Greasy cold mess.  Ever order I've gotten from here has been either super cold when it was delivered or burnt when I went to pick it up.  The staff is unhelpful.  They just stood there and looked at me blankly when I asked for a refund for the pizza I just picked up with a blackened crust.  Never again."
"5.0","This is my second favorite sushi place in Pittsburgh. Great sushi, very fresh perfect portions and service. Staff is authentic and courteous anytime I'm in station square this is my go to for sushi."
"5.0","I was walking to Qdoba when I passed Freshii and it caught my eye. I could tell that it looked like a healthy option for quick food. There were several bowl options and all looked delicious, I had a hard time choosing. Per the cashiers recommendation I got the teriyaki twist bowl with chicken. It was sooo good! Everything tasted fresh and the chicken was better quality than I've had at other quick food places (like chipotle). They also have a variety of fresh juices and smoothies to choose from. The only sad thing is they close at 5pm so be aware of that! I highly recommend!"
"5.0","Whenever I usually have a restaurant to recommend to a friend in Oakland, I usually say Beta Bites. It's location on S. Bouquet Street seems to cause it to fall under the radar for most people who are used to more well known South Oakland eating establishments like Antoon's, Sorrento's, Campus Deli, Spice Island, Las Palmas, etc. Personally, I think it's one of Oakland's best kept secrets that you accidentally stumble upon after a long night of debauchery on the weekends, especially if you have no idea how you got to that part of S. Bouquet Street in the first place. Asides from the mystique of the place, the food is excellent (special shout out to their French Fries and Kufta Panini). The food may take a while to serve since usually 1-2 people are working there at a time, but it's so worth the wait. Enjoy and tell all of your friends about this place!"
"5.0","Amazing service! I ordered on DoorDash and my food was delivered promptly. Everything was hot and tasty. Suzan even included sauce I asked for on the side which is often overlooked when using doordash. Will order again and recommend to friends!"
"4.0","Middle east ,indian ,pakistani food ...there is a meat shop too where you can buy fresh cut meat"
"4.0","Had great reviews on Yelp so decided to check it while in town for a Steelers game. Line was out the door but it moved fast. Service was friendly and quick. Orange juice was overpriced in my opinion. I was kicking myself after realizing there was lemon water for free. But I digress. The fat boy burger looked phenomenal. Juices and sauces flowed. My sausage egg and cheese was huge and delicious. Someone else got the crab eggs Benedict special which he enjoyed. Everyone cleared their plates. Next time I'm in Pittsburgh I'm going back!"
"1.0","Came here for happy hour a few weeks ago and had great service until the managers got involved. We had well over fifteen people and they would not let us get another table. The bar area is too small upstairs to have a casual happy hour and we were told to sit, so give us some seats, maybe?  They also would not split out check even though the entire time we confirmed with the waiters what tab each item ordered was to go on. Why say yes when you're not going to do it?  The manager was exceptionally rude to me and then when I questioned him he retreated to the back never to return. The red bearded men with headsets are the managers and they spend their time looking as busy as possible and forcing people to check in on this app, not considering the consequences of our unemployable experiences being reported to the app."
"5.0","We cannot recommend the Azorean Cafe enough, both for day to day dining and for private parties and catering. My husband and I have been patrons of the restaurant since it opened. We've loved everything we have eaten there - I am especially obsessed with the presunto breakfast sandwich and my husband loves all the seafood option - we have even tried tons of new dishes and never been disappointed. Elsa also gave us tons of recommendations for our own trip to the Azores and helped make it a huge success! This past weekend, we hosted a private party for my parents anniversary at the Azorean Cafe. Elsa was extremely easy to work with leading up to the party and made everything simple and customized to what we were looking for. She also helped to work within our budget, coming up with a menu that was delicious but also appropriate for picky and adventurous eaters alike. The night of the party Elsa and her staff were amazing. They kept the night moving and delivered on our every need. Our friends and family raved about how tasty the food was and especially the cake Elsa made. Not only that - they couldn't stop mentioning how nice and helpful she was! I can't say enough about our experience. The Azorean Cafe was the perfect place for our event and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it, order catering or have another event here in the future!"
"5.0","I stopped here after visiting Dave's Music Mine a couple doors away and they highly recommended it. Man was this place good. It reminds me of the kind of taqueria you would find in southern texas.I had the pork tacos and chose flour tortillas.  $3 each and well worth it. My daughter had the vegetarian black bean tacos and loved them.We will be back to try the nachos next time."
"5.0","This is some of the best Thai food I've had.  The place is really cozy and welcoming.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  The food came out remarkably fast and was was really unbelievably good.  The portions are huge-we all took ours home and had it for lunch the next day.  We had tom yum soup, medium spice, pad tai, low spice and pork fried rice.  All were exceptional.  My daughter said that the pork fried rice was the best she's ever had.  The price is downright cheap for the amount of food you get."
"5.0","I order Cafe Raymond's catering for my office, and they always do an OUTSTANDING job. Excellent communication whether by email or phone. Their delivery is a lifesaver for busy schedules. I've even called them last minute with an emergency order for 50 people and they made it happen! Everyone in our office RAVES about their salads.Quality food and quality service. Very grateful for the Cafe Raymond team!"
"5.0","Great lunch spot for a quick sandwich. Easy to walk to with refreshing teas and tasty sandwiches."
"4.0","Stumbled upon this gem, not far from the Strip District. The burgers are unique and flavorful, the pierogies are perfection ! Service was good and efficient. Will definitely return to try some of the other beers and burger options. I had the Pineapple jalape√±o sangria and it was delish. Not too spicy, light , with a bit of jalape√±o flavor."
"1.0","I have never had such a bad experience. I have lived in major metro areas all over the country, and have never experienced such terrible service. We came to celebrate a birthday and had a group of about 12. Now, I've dined in many an eatery with large groups, and I have NEVER been advised that the wait would be over 2 hours at Sienna Mercato. BUT, it was a birthday celebration. Well, how can I say this gently? Aside from being grossly overpriced ($10 for some roasted seasoned nuts, anyone? Perhaps $22 for a cheese tray?), the appetizers were not good to say the least and we were flat out profiled. Sit tight. This is long...We arrived at the restaurant around 6:15pm. We were told that wait would be long, but we could always pass some time upstairs at the Beer Garden. Fine. So we head up to the 3rd floor and stand around aimlessly for about 15-20 minutes until someone finally acknowledged the presence of a pretty sizable group. The server began to take drink orders, including water with lemon for the table. We were told that we could not have water, as they had no glasses. Ok. We will wait a few minutes for water. After waiting about 20 minutes for our water, they brought out glasses halfway full of room temperature water. Now, that's not such a big deal, but it was just the first of a string of issues with this place. We began placing drink orders and appetizers, and our server was nice enough. When the apps began to come out, it spiraled quickly downhill from here. We sent back an order of bruschetta (who throws raw tomatoes and cold cheese on soggy wonder bread and calls it an appetizer??), as well as some other pork/cat food/raw egg situation... So we ordered wings instead. The wings were tasty, which was the only saving grace. At one point, one of the wait staff came over and asked if we had ordered another bruschetta, and we laughed and said 'Not over here. We just sent one back'. He looked at me, rolled his eyes and snapped his neck and said 'did you order this or not?' With a heck of an attitude. I stared blankly at him. Really, sir?? Ok. So I requested a manager. Mind you, we had been upstairs for about an hour waiting for our table by this time. When the manager finally came over (after 3 requests) the manager came over and seemed less than interested in helping, accommodating, or addressing the issues. She pretty much rolled her eyes at everything that was said to her with regard to the less than stellar experience we had had up to that point (piss poor customer service, anyone?). We finally began inquiring about the state of our table downstairs, fed up with the foolishness upstairs. She cashed out our tabs saying that there shouldn't be much more of a wait. It was 8:03pm, as per the stamp on my receipt. The young lady called down and returned at 9:15pm (she never returned during that hour to check and see if we needed anything else. Another drink. Water. Nothing.) to inform us that it would be at least another hour. 3.5 hours for a table?? In Pittsburgh?? HOW? No one had a good answer. We then requested another manager. The one that showed up claimed to be the GM, and simply added to the attitude filled eye rolling party started by the initial, dark haired manager. She told us that we could either wait for at least another 45, or we could leave. No attempts to accommodate our group at all. They were BOTH extremely dismissive and very, VERY rude. We began explaining to them how disappointed we were at the treatment we had received. We expressed how we simply wanted to sit down and enjoy dinner. We expressed that it was simply UNHEARD OF to have to wait for 3.5 hours for a table for dinner. Neither cared. So, as we continued having conversation with the two managers about the awful experience, the manager that told us that we could either wait or leave was apparently tired of hearing what we had to say. She signaled to the dark haired manager, AND THIS WOMAN LEANED OVER INTO HER MIC AND REQUESTED SECURITY! SECURITY?? For what? Because we were dissatisfied with our service?? Because they were tired of hearing the criticism from a group of people that had been waiting WELL OVER 3 HOURS TO BE SEATED? Security walks over and we all are just stunned at what was happening. There was NO vulgarity. No threats of violence (who does that over a table for dinner? It's NEVER that serious). There was no yelling, cursing, disrespect, or anything of the sort. Just a group of people being treated TERRIBLY by what should be a customer service based organization. The sub par, overpriced food, the ignorant and disrespectful wait and management staff, and the lack of general concern or desire to accommodate a group of young professionals, and the blatant racial profiling that took place will cause me to NEVER set foot in this establishment again. EVER. I am highly disappointed and will be contacting the corporate entity to be sure that this is addressed. Never again"
"4.0","Damn, dem some tasty tacos. Sometimes I live on the edge and have taco Tuesday on Wednesday. Today was one of those days. They make something funky tasting tacos. And they're nice enough to include slices of lime you could squeeze on to further enhance the flavor."
"5.0","Amazing! Seriously this place was so good. I didn't want to stop ordering food. I ended up ordering sashimi, dumplings, and udon noodles. All of which were delicious. I like the fact that you can order as you go but they don't take a long time between each order. I tend to have eyes bigger then my stomach so a lot of times when I go to restaurants where it's small plates I tend to order too many. That was not the case at Umami. I was able to order 1 dish at a time and once I ordered another it was out within 5 minutes so it didn't turn into a 2 hour meal. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the drink I got. The drink with the pop rocks sounded exciting but it was sadly not that great. I definitely would like to go back and try some of the other drinks though."
"1.0","We get a menu from this place a few weeks ago in the mail (we live within walking distance). We have been wanting to try it for a while so we figured we would call for take-out around noon on a Sunday. I should have known as soon as I called that the situation would end as it did. 1. When I called and said I wanted a take-out order, she seemed a little confused but continued (you can order from Grubhub so one would assume they are set up for take-out). I ordered a bagel sandwich, no problem there. Then I ordered 1 slice of plain French toast, and that was confusing and asked what toppings I wanted (plain French toast...), then lastly I ordered a crepe that 'was no longer on the menu' (in case you forgot, we got this menu in the mail just a few weeks ago...). So I ordered a different one. She said 20-25 minutes so I was hopeful. 2. 30 minutes later (trying to give them longer than they said to prep), I walk in and one of the girls says 'oh let me tell the kitchen you are here, they are very  busy'. For context, there were multiple open tables inside, definitely not as busy as they could be. She comes back and says another 10-15 minutes. Cmon, that's 45 minutes after I called to get 3 simple items ready. But, we were hungry so I went right outside to wait. 3. Walk back inside 10 minutes later, she says 'oh we're out of mushrooms, you'll have to pick another crepe, they tried to come find you but you weren't around'. (I was standing right outside the place waiting, no one came to find me). She then said it would be another 10 minutes (this would be almost an hour since I called). And I just said cancel the whole thing. If you're still reading, morale of the story is don't make the same mistake we did and try to order take-out. Can't speak for how the food is, since we canceled it. It's quite a shame too, as we could have been repeat customers, living so close to it."
"5.0","Wow wow wow! This place is amazing and just might be the best sushi place in Pittsburgh. I was told about this place by a friend and was not expecting much since it's in station square. Most of the restaurants at Station Square are a little too touristy or 'chainy' for me. I would have never thought an authentic and high quality experience would be tucked away in station square. It was a little difficult finding the restaurant, since I had to enter a building with other shops and offices. The security guard behind the counter luckily showed me that the restaurant was just around the corner. I had to walk through some curtains to enter the restaurant. I was in awe when I saw the traditional Japanese decor and the sushi bar, where you could sit and enjoy watching the chef prepare the sushi. My friend and I ordered the sushi lover's meal which contains about 25 different pieces of sushi. Our meal started with some hot towels to wash our hands- a nice little detail. The meal included miso soup, which might've been the best miso soup I've ever had. I was really impressed that the server asked if I would prefer wasabi on the side or inside the sushi. We went with on the side, since my friend does not like spicy. However, next time I would definitely try sushi with wasabi inside (I think that's the traditional way of eating sushi). The sushi was phenomenal and I was really impressed with the quality of the fish. Everything was really fresh and the salmon was wonderful, it felt like it was melting on my mouth. The prices are very fairly priced. I would say that it was affordable for the amount and service we received. The sushi took some time to be prepared however, I did not mind because I knew that sushi takes some focus and detail to execute well and boy, did Kiku deliver."
"4.0","I was in the mood for breakfast but it was the lunch hour - what better place to go than Pamela's? I had the the Tex-Mex Omelette, which came with potatoes and toast. The food was good so was the service. The restaurant isn't fancy but it is popular.  Good food at a great price. One thing you should know it's CASH ONLY!"
"5.0","One of my favorite places in Pittsburgh, the beta combo is a very tasty meal and the portions are really big. A very friendly team. It definitely deserves 5 stars."
"5.0","This is one of my favorite restaurants i have ever been to. It was amazing! we walked in on a friday afternoon around lunch time after taking a tour at the heinz field and it was peaceful and not busy and over all amazing! we didn't have to wait a single minute the lady at the front gave George the menus and George was SO friendly! He sat my family and I down and then asked for our names! It was so nice to have someone know my name and it just made the experience overall better. I shared an 8 ounce steak and shared with my sister. For the 2 sides we replaced mashed potatoes and broccoli with their AMAZING mac&cheese. When we got the food, it also came with the broccoli and mashed potatoes and George said he thought we would like it and it cost no more. It was my sisters birthday and when we took her to the restroom he came out and surprised her with ice cream and brownies and it was so kind! We didn't even have to ask! George was one of the best waiters I have ever had and props to him he deserves a raise! IT WAS AMAZING THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!! George is the reason i want to come back"
"2.0","I've eaten here multiple times and never really had a bad experience. However, my most recent visit was  a bit unpleasant. After some absent service, I ordered the mini pierogies, which arrived with a seasoning on top that tasted uncannily like chicken flavored ramen seasoning packets. For my meal, I ordered the greek salad and added shrimp. When my salad arrived (45 minutes later), it only had 5 shrimp on it (which cost $6, so over $1 per shrimp) and the shrimp were cold. There was dried cheddar cheese on one piece of pita that came with my salad, but no cheddar cheese was supposed to be on the dish. As I was eating my salad, I noticed a strange yellow substance dried on my bowl...I'm telling myself it was just more cheese. After finally nearly breaking a molar on a kalamata olive that had not been pitted, I decided to give up on my salad--it was mostly the inner parts of a head of iceberg lettuce anyway.During my most recent visit, the service was poor and the food was terrible. I'm hoping that this was just an off day because the food here used to be good. Hopefully there will be an upswing--it is needed. From just today I'd give it 1 star, but I'll add another for my more positive experiences in the past."
"4.0","I came on Sunday around 12:30 looking for a lighter lunch. Instead, I ordered a feijoada and that was that. It just called to me. I added a cappuccino to the order as well. The place was packed. The only available seats were two chairs meant for reading while enjoying coffee, so I took up a spot there and waited. My cappuccino arrived shortly thereafter, so I was content for a bit. The cappuccino was beautiful and made well. The cinnamon stick was a nice touch, though I wonder about food waste sometimes.There was a wait for the food and when it arrived, I looked for a new seat as those chairs and an end table wasn't the way to eat this dish well. I moved to the stools up front by the window and people watched as I ate. The dish was quite heavy with mostly black beans. It was slow cooked and with some care. There was pork, but not the chorizo as described. The bread it  came with was good, looks of carbs with this meal. It reminded me of food from my South America adventures, so the cafe's Portuguese description resonates. I ate half and the rest was lunch for the following day. I found the food good. The service was a bit off. I didn't get a table number, which really perturbed the waiter. He was looking for who ordered the feijoada and was frustrated by that. He also didn't seemed too thrilled when I moved seats upon getting my food. Setting his reaction aside, I carried the plate and mug across the way. Maybe a bad day he was having.It's an interesting spot. I was hoping to see Portuguese egg tarts. Alas, none here. Good drinks and food still!"
"5.0","Thai Gourmet has really great food.  Be careful - they aren't afraid to make it spicy. Staff is always nice."
"5.0","We happened to stop here for lunch this weekend and we were so glad we did.  I had two tacos (siracha chicken and the pork) he had four (siracha chicken, regular chicken, pork, and beef) and we shared the nachos with meat.  Heaven.  Such wonderful food!  I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind a little hole in the wall place."
"1.0","Stopped in and sat at the bar. Planning on having a beer and eating something for dinner. The woman behind the bar didn't know anything about the beers and never came back to take our food order.  A guy behind the bar asked if we wanted another beer when our glasses were empty. We asked for our check and left."
"3.0","Old house converted to restaurant. Casual atmosphere, caters to students around. The 3 stars are because the service was good. The food itself - decent. Gobi manchurian was a good appetizer. The butter dosa was good too. The sambhar not the best I've had, but not bad. I didn't like that they put the bowls of sambhar and chutney on the dosa itself, rather than bring it on the side. If you're particular about hygiene, let them know. The paneer tikka masala was RED. I think that's food color, but could be wrong. Was not bad but I wasn't impressed. The chettinad was also decent. Like I said, decent food. Nothing bad. Except made me feel a little sick. Nothing wrong with it. But nothing to make me return."
"4.0","A limited menu but a stellar showing on the items we tried. The coffee was mellow and tasty, and offered a pleasant accompaniment to our breakfast. We shared a shrimp croquette (creamy, shrimpy, crunchy), cod bites (tasty potato and cod morsels), and the bacalau. Everything was very rich but also quite tasty. We aren't big pork eaters, but their menu has lots of pork options. Also, with an obligate GF diner, they were extra careful and checked on all of the menu items (the shrimp croquette wasn't GF, but everything else we ordered was!). I'll be back when I'm craving some tasty Azorean fare."
"5.0","I found out about this place from my Uber Driver.    I had a few cocktails down the street that had great food but ate there a couple of days ago.  I needed a change of pace.I walked down to Doce Taqueria.   A small restaurant full of flavor and character.  Their menu is on a chalkboard above where the prepare the food.  They have maybe 8-10 seats in a counter type setting.The place is awesome.   I watched many patrons come in for to-go orders.  Since I was new, I requested the server to choose my selection of 3 tacos (corn tortilla).I had a beef, pork, and chicken taco.   The beef and chicken were really good but my favorite was the carnitas (pork).   Not only did the port have great flavor, they put all the accouterments that one could want.  All the ingredients were fresh and the meal had great flavor.Since they do not serve alcohol - I enjoyed a Mexican soda (Grapefruit) which tasted like a Sprite.The meal was so good - I order 3 more 'to-go'.  I explained to the server I would need to be wearing my sweat pants for the next 3 tacos ;-).   I really enjoyed the meal and would recommend you stop by and give this a try."
"5.0","Great drunk chicken cheese steaks 10/10 would recommend, cashier is a sweetheart xoxo"
"4.0","Always a line but moves very quickly. The place is clean and super cute. So many choices on the board but when the daily specials are gone your out of luck. So get there early if you can! Pancakes are off the charts!! Eggs and brisket hash was a great choice too. I ordered an omelette and it was perfect. Lots of food. But get pancakes to share then order something else so you can have a taste of everything!!"

"4.0","I visited the Summit yesterday with my cousin from out of town at around 4pm.  While walking along Grandview Ave. en route to the Mon Incline after ascending the Duquesne Incline, a thunderstorm was brewing, so we decided to play it safe and take cover.  At our arrival, it was totally devoid of customers, but that changed when the downpour struck after 10 min., causing many people to seek a respite from the rain here.After perusing the menu, we both decided to order blueberry mojitos ($10), as well as goat cheese fritters to accompany them ($7).  It had been years since I'd last had a classic mojito, so I was curious to try the blueberry-infused variation.  The presentation was gorgeous (see photo), and the flavor was refreshing and well-balanced.  While the drink wasn't super alcoholic, it still packed a nice head tingling punch that added to the enjoyment.The goat cheese fritters came out a bit after the drinks.  Upon biting into one, I was surprised by a cold center, despite the perfectly crispy exterior.  I mentioned this to our waitress, and she took them away and put in a replacement order, which came out about 10 min. later.  Fortunately, the second order was cooked through. I'm a huge fan of goat cheese, and these fritters were light and subtler in flavor than I'm accustomed to, but were delicious on their own. While I'm not a big fan of jalapeno, I tried the candied jalapeno dipping sauce that accompanied them, and it wasn't too strongly flavored. I preferred the fritters on their own, though, so I ate most of them undressed.One of the more unique aspects of this bar, aside from some of the creative drinks, is that board games are available for entertainment while drinking.  I've seen this in coffeeshops, but never in a bar before, and I think it's an absolutely brilliant idea!  While sipping our cocktails, my cousin and I played a spirited game of Jenga, which I eventually won, to my utter surprise (score!).  As expected, several blocks from the tower toppled onto the table next to us--fortunately, however, none of them hit our neighbors' drinks, and they were good sports.Overall, my cousin and I greatly enjoyed our impromptu experience at the Summit.  The decor makes for an interesting setting, consisting mostly of distressed wood, as well as garage doors that can be opened (or closed, in the case of a storm!). If you're looking for an alternative to some of the more touristy joints on Shiloh, or are just in the mood for a hand crafted cocktail, be sure to stop by and check it out!"
"3.0","In a place filled with chain restaurants, Kiku is a welcome addition.  I first ate here the first time I had ever ventured to Station Square.  My friends all wanted chain places but I won out convincing them we could try those anywhere.  As other reviewers have mentioned, it seemed very empty.  Each time I've been here it was a Friday night and there were maybe two other tables with diners.  That being said, when we were greeted, they allowed us to choose which section of the restaurant we wanted to sit in.  The decor is what you would expect from a Japanese restaurant.  A lot of wood and prints.  It has a sort of cozy feel.  There is a decent sized menu along with a variety of daily specials.  I do have to question the specials, though, as they were the same in each of my visits.  There is something that will please every palate, including someone who won't try sushi or anything 'exotic'  For example, they even have fried chicken as an appetizer.On one of our visits, my husband was feeling adventurous and tried the Shabu Shabu.  Basically Japanese fondue.  It came with noodles, meat and a variety of vegetables.  It was tasty, but very pricey for what you got.  Other diners were pleased with their choices of various tempura dishes and a 'super combo.'Rolls were typical of what you would find at any other Japanese restaurant.  They were tasty, but nothing too imaginative.Overall, a good experience and decent food, but it is more pricey then most other Japanese restaurants in the Pittsburgh area."
"5.0","Phenomenal food, phenomenal atmosphere and phenomenal staff. Umami makes Japanese food right-- they have an amazing variety of food, each spiced with a careful hand and presented beautifully. This is one of my absolute favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh, and my go-to when I'm craving Japanese food. I've tried most of their menu-- nigiri is well formed and garnished neatly; sashimi expertly sliced and tender; karaage perfectly spiced; okonomiyaki tasty but not excessively heavy; fried ice cream warm and well balanced. I've never had a dish I didn't like, and each dish has its own flavor profile, carefully perfected. While a little bit on the pricier side, the quality of the food here is absolutely worth it. You can make reservations online (and should if you have a party larger than 2 or want a table), but seating is first come first serve. The bar seating is full service, and the staff is all amazingly attentive and friendly."
"5.0","I installed the Yelp app just to leave a review for this place - it's amazing. My husband and I have had high tea at several locations before our time at Arnold's. Hands down, Arnold's has them all beat. Not only did they have a table reserved and at the ready for us when we arrived, everything was exquisitely placed and organized. The tea selection was much more robust than any locale we had been to prior, and the pairings (which they have many options to choose from) were exquisite. The quality of both the tea and food was wonderful, but I would be remiss in mentioning the warm, welcoming atmosphere. The entire area feels very homey without sacrificing any quality, and I would be remiss in saying how relaxing it is here. Even if you don't want a high tea and just a normal cuppa, I would recommend Arnold's Tea very highly."
"5.0","Just came back from Pittsburgh and ate here for our 25th Wedding Anniversary   The Alaskan King Crab melted in my mouth.  The gorillas asparagus and potatoes were fantastic.  The hubby had Sushi and Lobster, which was very good.  Our waiter went above and beyond expectations.  Oh, the mixed drinks were yummy!I would highly recommend!!"
"5.0","Monday night I stopped by with my dog as this restaurant came up as a dog friendly place. I was seated outside quickly and got service quickly afterwards. The staff was very friendly and brought a dog bowl. I ordered a fat head IPA beer and it was great! I ordered the highest ABV IPA, as I don't usually drink beer much. I ordered the fried chicken entree as there were some food options that the restaurant was out of at the time. Although, my food came out wrong, the staff took care of everything and made things right. I sincerely enjoyed my food and my beer. I will most likely return again in the future."
"5.0","Awesome little spot with great food and service! Went twice on our trip. The smoked salmon with homemade ciabatta was crazy good and my husbands egg sandwich was great too. Side of potatoes were super crispy-def on point. Would recommend."
"5.0","It's prob one of the least healthiest things you can put in your body but the best brunch place in Pittsburgh hands down. It's been there for years. You must get their strawberry hot cake. Their hash is amazing too. Cash only. Bette than Oakland locatiin"
"5.0","Normally I get takeout, but a friend and I stopped in for the lunch buffet right on a Saturday afternoon. The buffet is predominantly South Indian, which means you may not find the dishes that are typical in American Indian restaurants, which mostly come from the North. So (for example) there was no butter chicken, but there WAS a very lovely spicy Andhra-style chicken curry where the chicken was super-tender as it was still on the bone. It reminded me quite a bit of the chicken curries I ate in India. We also had the curd rice (delicious, like a savory rice pudding with mustard seeds and curry leaves), and a number of Northern-style vegetable curries--saag aloo and cauliflower in cashew sauce were particulary good. And you get free dosas! The buffet is (imo, as a Westerner who has been to India but doesn't claim any expertise in Indian cuisine) very authentic to the consistency and spice of what you might get in India, but people who are used to more Americanized food may find it unfamiliar.I usually get chicken 65, vegetable Chettinad, and samosas for takeout--the samosas are huge and always crispy. It's a draw between this place and Udipi for me in terms of South Indian in Pittsburgh--Tamarind is much closer but Udipi has upma. But you can't do better in terms of buffet, and lunch is dirt-cheap."
"4.0","Love this place. Their prepared food counter is the perfect Middle Easter food fix in Pittsburgh. Everything is amazing and you can tell by the steady flow of local Middle Eastern traffic that they are making phenomenal food. Their lamb shank is ridiculous."
"5.0","The food is amazing. I only have done pick up. I always walk to get it which is usually a ten minute walk. I typically leave shortly after getting off of the phone with them, and no matter how long they say it will be (15-20 minutes), it is always waiting for me.The amount of food they give you lasts several meals. I cannot recommend enough the bang for your buck in quantity and quality."
"4.0","Thank you fellow Yelpers for making me aware of this one! I never would have imagined such a place existed! And it's not obvious by looking at the place that such wonderful food resides inside that door. We intended to try Coca Cafe for brunch but the line was far too long so we decided, based on Yelp reviews, to go up the hill and try Caffe Mona since it was so close. WOW. Amazing. The place is small but it has a deck out back that, in good sunny weather, offers a great place to sit, relax, and enjoy some good food.Great menu selections include a prix fix 3 course brunch for $13.99 - includes unlimited coffee, a fresh fruit plate (tons of fruit!), and entree, and a dessert crepe. That's what we chose but I don't think we could have gone wrong with anything on that menu. I got the Mediterranean omelet which was done to perfection with peppers, olives and feta cheese. My wife got the savory French toast with brie, fig preserves, and slices of granny smith apples on a thick piece of French toast. She claims this may have been the best breakfast dish she's ever had. I tried it (imagine that!) and concur - it truly was amazing. People next to us got the berry stuffed French toast which, I admit, I drooled over. Even with a full stomach I would have taken a bite if they had offered. He couldn't finish his and took half home.The crepe was the only disappointment - it tasted like it had been made ahead of time and was a little hard. I know crepes and they should be thin, served warm, and not crunchy in the least. I'm willing to forgive it since by the time that was served, I could barely eat another bite. All in all it was a great place. GREAT place. I'm ready to go back."
"5.0","Best tacos in Pittsburgh.Plus they are cheaper than most 'boutique' taco spots. Also they are open late. Basically, if you like tacos, then go to Doce. Not tomorrow, not next time you're in the southside, right now...I'll see you there..."

"5.0","I cannot say enough good things about Sausalido. We had our rehearsal dinner here last month and I'm so glad we did. Our guests were raving about the food. We had salmon and steak as our entrees which were both delicious but I think the meatball appetizer was the crowd favorite. My husbands cousin snuck into the back to ask for more at one point. Nick, the owner, was wonderful to work with throughout, he is a great guy. Very responsive to emails and he made me feel so much better when I realized I didn't get enough red wine for everyone. The space was perfect for our group of 36, with a great location on liberty and lot right around the corner. Thank you Nick and team!"
"4.0","Keep it short.....full of heat!  wooo!   I forget what we got exactly, but it was delicious.  Def sweated it out at the table 3/4 of the way into the meal.   *And to clarify, I really enjoyed the heat!  More is more for me!!!There was a deal for students that we forgot to get.  I will def be visiting here the next time I am looking for Indian food in Pittsburgh."
"5.0","These are legit tacos, in fact the best I've had in the burgh. I had shredded chicken and then the Barbacoa and they were both amazing. You can choose between 'mexican' and 'american' toppings which was nice cause I had my kids with me.Not a lot of room on Saturdays when the strip district is a zoo, but it's worth the trek."
"4.0","It's all about their Beets and Bleu salad. Yum. I ordered mine with grilled salmon and white balsamic dressing on the side. Everything is to die for and at $12 for the lunch portion, is one of the best deals I've seen in a long time for a fancy lunch salad.The salad itself is massive and is heaping with marinated beets & red onions, pecans and blue cheese. There is no skimping here!  I didn't even use any of the dressing because it wasn't needed. The salmon filet was the perfect size and cooked to perfection. I'd like to try this salad  again with the chicken.I've eaten here before and can totally vouch for not only the portion sizes and their Havarti Turkey and Asparagus sandwich. It was so awesome and lovely but too huge for me to finish. I had a bit of my friend's Chicken Cutlet sandwich and it was equally heavenly (I'd share that one though - it's pretty rich and huge for one person).Yes, the inside is a bit cramped for the amount of tables they have but I'll take a small, intimate and delicious local place over the cavernous drivel of a chain restaurant any day. Definitely check these guys out the next time you're in Bloomfield!"
"4.0","I went into this local pub close to the hotel I was staying and it is a pretty good Sports Bar. They have some good beers on tap and had a fairly decent menu. I thought the atmosphere was good and upbeat. The service was very good and it seems like a pretty good local hangout. The prices are resonable and that is why I have been back since my first visit.I bet on gameday this place is crazy since it is just across the river from PNC Park"
"1.0","Wow what a stupid service. First it was supposed to take 45min which we could wait, after 1h30 the online service said it was delivered even if it wasn't... On the phone they told us they 'assumed' it was on the way... 30min later, we called again, passed to the UTLRA rude manager that basically just hung up on us.. WTF! The food arrived after 2h30 completely cold! Wow! It would be hard to give a service that bad even if I tried!"

"5.0","I hosted a military reunion for 36 people recently, and needed a place close to our hotel for a buffet loncheon.  The planning process was very easy, and the price very reasonable.  When we arrived the food was brought out immediately.  We had the tailgate buffet, and I heard good cooments about the sliders and especially the buffalo chicken.  The waitstaff was knowledgeable and attentive.  I would recommend the Bettis Grill to anyone."

"1.0","This is my second visit. I am a bit disappointed in the price.  My first visit I ordered the omelet and it came with a side of potatoes for 9.99. I enjoyed it but, i was surprised it didn't come with toast. My second visit I ordered the two egg breakfast. Again, 9.99. Well it was not worth it. There was two pieces of bacon, the smallest piece of wheat bread and a small portion of potatoes. It is way over priced. I will not give it a third try."
"5.0","This place was simply delicious. Although the decor and ambiance is not necessarily what I'm used to for an Indian restaraunt, the food blew me away. I got the chicken Koorma and it was the perfect balance between sweet, spicy, and savory and the chicken was cooked perfectly. Service was great. The only thing that wasn't perfect was the seating. The tables are a little close together so it was kinda hard to have an intimate feel. Other than that this place is awesome."
"2.0","There isn't anything wrong with the place, but the only thing really right is its proximity to the Roberto Clemente bridge. Sixteen different beer taps, mostly mega brews. Full bar, bar food. $30 (pre-tip) for lunch for 2. (Just iced tea to drink) so it's pricier than I really was looking for."
"5.0","Some of the best food I ever have had. Always heard raving reviews about this place before going to Pittsburgh and had high expectations but when I took a bite of the #7, the Heath, and the Porter, all expansions were blown away. These sandwiches are something I wish I could live off of. Service is great and even after ordering 6 sandwiches with my dad and uncle, they were able to prepare them quickly and within a few minutes. If you ever find yourself in Pittsburgh PA, it ain't a real trip there until you stop by Peppi's"
"4.0","The concept of Il Tetto is awesome. Rooftop bar that is open air during warmer months. Great beer and beverage selections. Place can pack in a solid crowd.             Reality: drinks are pricey and service can be a little slow. The venue and the drink offerings are 5/5 but the service/ cost is about 3/5. Despite these negatives I still really like this place. I recommend coming here for a few drinks before or after dinner at one of the two restaurants below."

"1.0","Last night my boyfriend was really craving an Italian Hoagie, so we decided to order in. We picked a random menu from the many we get in our mailbox. Unluckily, we chose this place. Called in and an hour later we received our order.As we opened it up, he noticed that his Italian Hoagie was just a thin layer of meat on bread. Now, we all know what comes on an Italian Hoagie. He called back and informed them of their mistake and requested a new Hoagie be delivered, they said to him that he would have to return the first Hoagie which he had no problem with seeing as he wasn't going to eat it. About 10 mins later, they called back saying the driver was only going to deliver the vegetables that were supposed to be on it. Unhappily, he accepted it because he was hungry and just wanted to eat. Now 15 minutes after that phone call, my boyfriend called back wondering if he was on his way. They replied that the driver only left 3 minutes ago which was unnerving to say the least.As another 5-10 minutes passed, becoming aggravated as the Hoagie was soggy and cold, we called back to ask for a refund because we had become very unhappy at this point, 1hr and 40mins after we initially placed the order from this location. Their response to the refund request was so completely ridiculous, saying they would only refund the vegetables. Now, if you ordered a pizza and it was delivered without cheese, wouldn't it be absolutely ridiculous if not only the shop didn't provide you with a replacement, seeing as it's completely their fault, but told you that they were only going to refund you for the cheese. I was completely disgruntled, being a manager myself. This place did not provide good customer service. This is not how you correct a mistake, this is how you lose your customers. My boyfriend did not get what he ordered and he did not get what he PAID for. Gennaro's was absolutely unprofessional and as I work downtown as well, I will definitely be passing this on to as many people I can. Ordering from Gennaro's is a BIG MISTAKE and I will never, ever do it again."
"3.0","Great service... Great drinks.. Awsome yakitori.. However the deep fried katsu bone Inn over rice and  assorted slaw stuff was way out there.     And too sweet mos6 of the main entrees looked too done. Up, I can only attest to what I ordered. Grew up in Japan. So maybe I'm more traditional.   Other wise good vibe. Go eat dinner somewhere else but have a drink and a yakitori here."
"4.0","The manager Michelle is wonder. She was extremely attentive to all patrons and made sure food and beverage was being brought out in a timely and accurate fashion.  Actually does,act, and behave like a top notch manager should. I would hire her in a second"
"1.0","We came here after a concert because we were really hungry. It took a pretty long time to get sat and then it took awhile for are server to get to us. The power went out twice which I though was kinda creepy. The server was nice but kinda clueless. The food we ordered was not described in the menu will so when it came out it was not what we expected. I was not asked if we want a refill and are app came out after are meal and it was covered in spilled sauces. I wanted to get some cookies to take home because I use to get them as a kid but I had to wait about 10 min in an empty line because there was nobody at the register. I probably would try this place one more time but If it is still bad I will not be returning."
"4.0","If your looking for some flavorful food, try MR Bulgogi.  The Spicy Pork Rice Bowl had a little kick but not a lot (actually would like it a little more spicy) and was very tasty.  It came with rice and lettuce and two little dumplings.  Added a side of Kimchi that was small but just right to go along with the bowl."
"1.0","Probably the worst pizza I ever had, so much grease and barely no sauce on the pizza with a thick layer of cheese..the cheese steak hoagie I got was so messy and the bread was soggy, I'll probably never order from here again."
"3.0","I would have said their beer was good but we sat at the bar for 15 minutes and no one even looked our way. Place looks cute but we moved on to Southern Tier."
"5.0","One of my favorite bars in the city! Their seasonal drinks are to die for and often you won't find anything like them being made anywhere else in the city. Currently they have a sweet potato bourbon cocktail happening topped with an actual toasted marshmallow. There's also the warm apple cider which I would like to drink every day this winter.I could go on and on about the drinks but their food is a win too with an also seasonally changing menu. All of their ravioli dishes have been excellent and I've had three different versions of them, right now it is one with mushroom which typically I'm not the biggest fan of but they know how to make me love them.Also, the atmosphere is great, warm, inviting and with board games. You really can't go wrong. I would absolutely recommend everyone check out this spot."
"1.0","Terrible Delivery Service. Manager and worker seems to not understand what the customer is saying and just had a rude attitude throughout."
"4.0","I ordered the Electric Banana pizza as I can never pass up anything with banana peppers. It's basically a white pizza with banana peppers and blue cheese. I had never tried anything like it and was surprised to discover that this combination of flavors really worked. My husband and I split the pizza down the middle for lunch and were both satisfied. My only complaint is that the prices were a little steep."
"4.0","I had the corn beef and it had a lot of meat in it plus the bread was really fresh. It's hard to find parking if you park in a lot it's about $9.00 it's a location to go to if your already shopping or attending a show. It's older but they have enough seating and you can see interesting people walking the street."
"3.0","The Summit joins the list of several relatively new upscale yet relaxed gastropub/cocktail bars in Pittsburgh.  I came here with some friends the other night and left satisfied but without any strong urge to make it a regular spot.  We started with a few cocktails on happy hour special (6 bucks 5-7 M-F).  All were quite good and were made with care.  If this review were for those cocktails alone, during happy hour, the review would be a solid 4.5 stars.  We waited about an hour total for a table for 4 to open up.  There wasn't really a system to put your name on a waiting list or anything as there wasn't a host/hostess, so people were pretty much just snagging tables as they become available.  Also, they don't take reservations.We managed to order a few apps (fries, fried goat cheese balls, and the cheese plate).  All were good, though the cheese plate had only one solid cheese and two soft cheeses.  For entrees we decided to split a few dishes, so I ended up trying the pork belly ramen, the burger, a root vegetable salad, and the green curry chicken wings.  I wasn't a big fan of the ramen as the noodles were somewhat under-cooked and the portion was quite small for the price ($16), the burger and wings were great though.  We saw some other tables get the tacos, which we would have given them a try, but they were sold out by the time we ordered :(Overall, a good experience, and probably the best option in Mount Washington if you're looking for a trendy place off Grandview.  However, I'd rank them slightly below places like Station, Tender, or Butcher and the Rye."
"5.0","Nothing but incredible dishes. The best place in Pittsburgh for sashimi and possibly one of the best Pittsburgh restaurants. Excellent if you want high quality sashimi rather than Americanized rolls. The robatayaki is also amazing as are the cocktails and even the ramen. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu."
"4.0","Place was nice I sat at the bar. The meat and cheese boar was great! Chefs pick (is there really any other way!?) they gave me pickled asparagus that i wasn't so fond of and the big pieces of bread are not very finger friendly type... But the rest of the selection was great as was the wine! The food looked great as well. Although i didn't order any. A tip for this place- they are located on theSecond floor. You can hardly see the sign from the outside."
"4.0","Good food but slow service. We ordered at 11- an hour ahead of time with 8 people. We arrived at 12 and still had to wait 15 minutes. The food came out and it was delicious! I ordered the Elvis crepe. It was filled with peanut butter and topped with bananas and bacon. Everyone else in going enjoyed everything from sandwiches to french toast. We asked for the check and waited another 15 minutes and had to ask again. There only seemed to be one server and one cook, which is why it took so long. Our server was friendly though, just seemed had too many people to help. We ended up being 15 minutes late, given an hour for lunch. I would come back but be sure to order before and ask for the check first."
"3.0","While walking back to work from Spice Island one day, I made a mental note to try more pizza places in Oakland. First on the list - Pizza Romano.I walked in around 11:10 and was one of their first customers. I saw them rolling out the dough for my XL pie, which is definitely a good sign. The pizza came out fresh and piping hot, and continued to be hot even after I carried it all the way back to work. I mention this because I have an undying love for cold pizza, but Pizza Romano is a dish best served fresh out of the oven.Here is the breakdown:Crust - texture was kind of blah and uninspired, but the dough was extremely wholesome - like eating a roll or something - and definitely tasted pretty fresh. Not crisp or chewy enough for me though.Cheese - best part of the pizza for sure. Lots of cheese, very chewy and stretchy, like one of those lame commercials where a family is sitting around the table on a Friday night instead of the reality that they are sitting in a living room watching awful TV while the parents get wasted on wine coolers and Canadian blended whiskey. However, the cheese quality slowly declined as the temperature of the slice went down, and I would describe this pizza as one that would be much less tasty when cold or leftover.Sauce - eh. It was red, some tomato flavor, some spices, but nothing that knocks my socks off.Price - ten bucks for a fresh-out-of-the-oven 18 inch, can't complain about that. Overall, this pizza was average. It would probably be best if eaten in the restaurant, but there isn't a whole lot to look at in the restaurant (no TVs, no bars, no other patrons) so make sure if you order it that your final destination is close. I would recommend Milanos over Romano if you're looking for a delicious and budget-conscious slice in Oakland."
"5.0","Burghers was exceptional! We ate there on a Thursday evening and it wasn't super crowded, there were a few other couples/families. Everyone working was so nice, like put a smile on your face kind of nice. Between us we ordered the Fox Chapel Burger, Polish Hill Burger, and Everything Bagel Hot Dogs. The burgers were cooked to perfection and the toppings complimented each other perfectly. The smell from the rosemary fries is amazing, and the bagel dogs could be a meal by themselves. We will definitely be back to try other Burger combinations and apps."
"1.0","Horrible services and automatically charged gratuity! They even wrote down the percentage of gratuity directly on the credit card receipt, and just asked for my signature. Not to mention that the room for sitting was very narrow. Sitting at the biggest table, I thought the sofa on one side could only hold one person to comfortably sit on, even we were quite fit. That meant the largest number of people that could come to the restaurant and sit gracefully was two. The waitresses were not responsive. I asked a lady for three small bowls, but she did not give me. They never smiled, looking like I owed them money. Moreover, actually I can speak Chinese. When I heard that the waitresses were talking in Chinese, I started to talk to the lady in Chinese as well. However, in many times, she replied in English. A little bit weird, right? The last thing I have to mention. When we got the check, 15% gratuity directly displayed on the check. I gave them my credit card. When they returned the receipt to me, asking for my signature, I could see that they had already written down the 15% gratuity on the receipt 'on behalf of me', but I never approved them to do so. This was such an offence to me. I will never come again. I hope that the waitresses there could learn to be honest, and never write down the percentage of gratuity on the receipt on behalf of their customers."
"3.0","Maybe this is blasphemy of some sort, but Pamela's? I don't know what other people see in it.There's always a line out the door, so I rarely end up going there.  Why wait when there are 600 million other places within walking distance?It's cash only, which is basically a business's way of saying 'Hello, customer.  I really hate you, and want to make sure you have to go out of your way to find a way to pay me.'  It's like when someone intentionally gets a 2-door car when a 4-door model is available.  You only do that if you really hate your passengers.The food is, well, it's okay! But just okay.  The pancakes are super-greasy.  They're not bad, though.  I do have to put in a word for their corned beef hash, though, because evidently that is excellent.I would like to one day try their lunch/dinner food, though.  One thing I do love about Pamela's is the price.  It's dirt cheap, and that's great.But get a credit machine! It's not like you can't afford it! Stop abusing your customers!"
"5.0","I was really in the mood for some classic Italian - which rarely happens. This place came as a recommendation from a friend's grandfather who grew up in Lawrenceville. While not like some of the other places we frequent in our neighborhood, the change was great. Old school Italian, friendly staff, regulars around the bar...all made for a pleasant experience. The food was really good, desserts were great. We got four desserts and had a long debate over which was best...really, they were all delicious. To top it off, they get fresh bread daily and had some extra loaves. We left with leftovers and a fresh loaf in hand. We were a party of four and everyone was pleased that we went for a more classic place versus some of the more 'trendy' places we usually frequent."
"1.0","My wife and I stopped Thursday evening for a couple of sandwiches after bowling. What usually takes about 45 minutes took 90 minutes. Our food was warm not hot, everything tasted ok. The real turn off was the extended wait time. Thank god they were not packed. Other patrons were upset about having to wait longer than necessary. There is a definite problem here with management. The waitresses seemed disgusted like they are over worked. They need a new manager and more staff. I sent a complaint to Eat N Park Corporate and got an e-mail from the manager. This was always a nice place to stop for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Not anymore!"
"5.0","Best place for lunch in Pittsburgh! Gorgeous patio, remarkable service and people, delicious food and drinks all to the sound of a beautiful fountain. I'll be back!"
"5.0","We treated ourselves to lunch today, in grand flavors, at the Capital Grille in downtown Pittsburgh.  I ordered and enjoyed the lobster roll ($22.00), rich juicy chunks lightly seasoned and my lunch date enjoyed the Blue Burger ($18.00) rare and seasoned fries.  Both were so tasty, the service was wonderful."
"5.0","I finally stopped in for the first time today after walking and driving past-- so glad I did!  I got the chorizo breakfast sandwich, and it was delicious!  I got it to go, but I will definitely be back to dine in as it is a cute space."
"3.0","My husband and I were excited to try this place, but unfortunately it wasn't our favorite brunch experience.  The back patio is beautiful and we really enjoyed sitting outside on a nice summer day, but it was very busy and took us about 45 minutes to get our food after we ordered. Our meal was decent, but nothing was good enough for us to want to try again.  Crepes were well made though."
"1.0","I ordered the other night from this place and got a chicken twist fit $7.49. It had 3 small slivers of chicken in it that added up to about 7 inches in a 14 inch long 3 inch wide twist. When I called to complain they told me it was my fault because it was my first order but Gary did give me a credit when I started the scream. With my credit I ordered a gourmet pizza with double pepperoni, ham, and cheese. There is one and a half pieces of pepperoni per slice and the cheese doesn't even meet the crust. I will NEVER order again but God bless you if you do. There is far better pizza shops than this."
"5.0","Okay so let me start by saying DELICIOUS! I got the vegan option with avocado. Seriously so yummy. I could eat probably 5 more easily. I'm glad they had corn tortilla's as an option too. Also a nice selection of hot sauce's and very cool decor! Sugar skulls on the walls and bright colors! Staff was super friendly! I recommend coming here for sure!"
"5.0","This is definitely one of the best places to eat in Pittsburgh! Went here for lunch with my husband and we loved everything! Pretty great service as well!"
"3.0","Recently redeemed a Groupon during our first--and, unfortunately, probably last--trip to Sausalido.Let me just get this out of the way first...Something that was impossible to ignore during our dinner and now as I'm writing this review was a very audible disagreement that occurred between the kitchen and the front of the house.  It lasted nearly 5 minutes and changed the tone of our experience.  Sausalido's dining room is about the size of my living room, and there's no substantial separation of the dining room and the kitchen, not even a door.  We heard everything; how could we not?  When the hostess/waitress returned to our table with our salads she was visibly shaken, and we couldn't help but feel bad, but, I'm sorry, we shouldn't have to be troubled with those kinds of emotions during our dinner.  It was unfortunate and uncomfortable, to say the least.Another thing that was odd was that one of the cooks, at least twice during our time at the restaurant, walked through the dining room and out the front door to sit at one of the chairs outside.  No doubt this bustling section of Liberty Avenue makes for some good people-watching, but I'm not sure it's professional for staff to draw attention to themselves by walking the length of the dining room and using the front door during service.Now about those salads.  They were really fantastic!  I loved the addition of beets at no charge, the fresh mixed greens, and the wonderful house-made salad dressings.  Loved that the entrees come with salads, in addition to some a-little-too-mayo-y-tasting white bean dip that's served with a few slices of rather plain, spongey bread.Our entrees were flavorful and nicely executed and plated, while the condiments on the baked smoked gouda appetizer seemed out of place but were tasty nevertheless.Aforementioned heated argument aside, service was nice and very efficient.  I did notice one slight insincerity though, which involved the daily risotto.  Early on the waitress described the creole chicken and bleu cheese risotto as soooo good, but then, a little later when we ordered, admitted that she hadn't tasted the risotto after I asked if the dish was spicy.Lastly, Sausalido's corkage fee is a mere $2 per person, and they sell no alcoholic beverages.  During dinner we regretted not bringing a bottle."
"1.0","Serves cold sandwiches!! Horrible service!! I asked to have my sandwich heated up and they said they could not do it!! Shouldn't be able to serve food that can't be heated!! Health code violations everyhwere!!"
"4.0","Very good local deli. The menu is accessible and a tad creative. The best part is the people followed by the prices. I like to get a cup of their chili (regular or hot sausage) with just about any sandwich. They have a selection of salads and a small salad bar too."
"4.0","Two of us went for dinner on a Wed evening.   We both had sushi.The service was prompt and friendly.  The waitress didn't get upset when she had to come back twice to see if we were ready to order because we hadn't decided yet.  The sushi was very good.  Not the best I've ever had, but very good and fresh.  Miso soup was some of the best I've ever had."
"1.0","This place is absolute trash.  The bartender, Kimmie, is totally rude and unprofessional. She allowed a customer who I assume to be a friend of hers, to become extremely drunk and belligerent and start harassing customers. And when I decided to say something to her about it, she cut me off as if I was the problem. Like I said trash. It was dirty and I did order food but threw it out because I didn't trust it after complaining and receiving the reaction I did.  Never, have I ever been treated with such disrespect in a restaurant and I'm black lol. I will never go back to that establishment and will recommend AGAINST them every chance I get.  And to Kimmie if you see this, you suck at your job so yes I will tell you how to do it."
"5.0","All I can say is YUM! Love the bread and dipping oils and every meal I've ever had here. Plus the happy hour specials are a steal! Feels like a true Pittsburgh establishment with decor and staff to match. A welcome change from all of the new, expensive, impersonal spots popping up around the city."
"3.0","Hmmm. Well, the space and rooftop are both beautiful, but I could do without the pretentiousness. Having people wait, albeit not too long, simply for waiting's sake is for other cities, not the 'burgh. And I didn't appreciate having to ask a server if I could order drinks from her as she refused to make eye contact. Just odd. Good draft list! I'll try it again, I think arriving early or late is the key."
"4.0","Listen to reviews, this place is great! I really liked the easy going atmosphere - you walk in, place order & pay. They bring you your food. Breakfast was very good, did not have a huge selection but what they did have was very good. Would like to vegan option, at least one. Also, had Heinz ketchup with high fructose corn syrup which was bummer. We told ray about Organic Heinz and he said he would start using it! We will see next time we swing by!"
"1.0","AWFUL. I ordered a Cesar wrap, no tomatoes and with ranch. Tomatoes are all up in this wrap and I got Cesar dressing. I ordered cheese fries with bacon- these are the most pitiful, disgusting fries I've ever had. There is hardly any cheese and NO BACON. The cheese that is present is clearly from the end of the container and gelatinous. The fries are disgusting and sweaty. The portion was underwhelming and super small (two of us were going to eat these based on price). We couldn't eat them, they were promptly tossed. There are too many similar places like this in Pittsburgh, I recommend you go elsewhere."
"5.0","Large cheese pizza $6.00 plus AWESOME! Pizza is actually very good and can't beat the deal. Will definitely be going there every time I'm in Pittsburgh."
"5.0","Definitely one of the best dining experiences ever. Between the atmosphere and the impeccable service, not to mention the delicious food. I recommend the scallops and asparagus risotto for this season. From start to finish everything was excellent. This would be a great place for a special birthday or an anniversary."
"4.0","Great selection of very reasonably priced pastries and sandwiches. This is the perfect place for a sweet afternoon snack.The chocolate croissant was very flaky and decadent without being greasy. The chocolate was distributed nicely throughout the pastry, so you didn't get a giant mouthful of solid chocolate at once, as often happens with these pastries. I would come early for lunch, though, it seems like they run out of sandwich and lunch items pretty quickly. They also have a frequent diner club where you can earn points and get discounts. Seating is a little limited, but they do have a few cafe tables outside."
"4.0","The sandwiches were delicious. We had the #7 and the cheesesteak. The sandwich is generous size and so yummy."
"3.0","Another downtown place within the Cultural District that's just meh to me. It's kinda more like a sports bar, sort of. Just always a weird crowd the handful of times I've popped in before or after a show. Just like others in the area it's more for suburbanites and yinzers. The food is ok. Nothing to write home about."
"5.0","I can't recommend this enough!  We recently moved to the area and were excited to finally give Azorean Cafe a try!  We went for dinner on Friday night (a recent addition to their hours).  They had a live singer who was FANTASTIC (Donna O.) and the whole experience was great.  We we warmly greeted, the staff were all extremely attentive and helpful, and the owner/chef made sure to visit each table to ask about the meal and chat.  We started with a bread basket and shrimp appetizer.  The shrimp was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  We also had the kale soup and galinha with esparguete and chrouico (chicken and chorizio in spaghetti with a saffron sauce.)  Each came with a side salad.  Everything tasted wonderful.  I'm not too versed in Portuguese fare, but from what we've heard it's extremely authentic.  They did have a dinner menu, but you are also able to order off the breakfast and lunch menu at dinner.  They even brewed a special pot of decaf just for us after dinner.  Definitely worth a trip!"
"1.0","Although I had found a good pizzeria on Craig St already (Pizza Prima), I decided to give Little Nipper's a shot. I came into the restaurant on a Friday afternoon and was greeted by the owner. I asked him the dimensions of the Large Pizza, and he couldn't even give me a definitive answer. He just said 12 slices, which gives me absolutely no information about how big it is. I ended up ordering a medium Nipper's Specialty (combination pizza).When I got back home, I was astonished that anyone could actually ruin pizza. The green bell peppers, mushrooms, and onions weren't cut thinly, and as a result, soaked the pizza. The pizza had no flavor because the water diluted all of the salt in the cured meats (pepperoni and bacon). Furthermore, the dough was chewy because they didn't bake it long enough to evaporate the water. Simply put, it was a bad experience.I will never come here again. $15 for a medium mediocre specialty pizza is a joke. I would much rather go to Pizza Prima, which is only half a block away."
"5.0","Always incredible. I have celiac, and they are very accommodating. Food has never made me sick, and the staff is very knowledgeable.Pad Thai is incredible, and service is always fast.Highly recommend"
"4.0","We liked everything except the bacon. Another waiter recommended the ham for next time. If you like potatoes be sure to ask for extra crispy. The crepes were great come in a stack of three. I'd suggest getting one or two only. The fresh strawberry were great even though out of season. Definitely will eat here again."
"4.0","Visited their lunch buffet this past weekend, and I was pleased.  I don't think it is the best Indian buffet in Pittsburgh (I prefer Taste of India by Children's Hospital) but it was good.  They had four vegetarian dishes (chana masala, pakoras soaking in curry sauce, palak paneer, and an eggplant dish), three chicken dishes (chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken and chicken curry), pakoras, papadums, a salad bar, and gulab jamuns.  The eggplant dish was my favorite.  The buffet is $7.99, and we got two $2 off coupons after we paid.  The only downside is a lot of their dishes contain nuts, even the ones you wouldn't expect like vegetable korma and paneer tikka masala.  If you have allergies, just ask them to leave the nuts out - I have never found any in my dishes once I started asking the cook to omit them.  I also have been ordering from here about once a week and I think they are reasonably priced, the portions are big, their delivery is reliable (they're rarely late and they've occasionally been up to half an hour early), and the food is good.  I'm definitely a big fan."
"5.0","I discovered this place last week and ordered for a second time today. Delivery was on time. The staff was very friendly. The food was fantastic. The lamb kabob hoagie was perfect - fresh bread meat cooked to perfection, awsome sauce. I had mine with spinach and olives, which turned out to be a great combination. Try them...I think that you will be impressed."
"3.0","Dumb cheap, literally JUST drunk pizza. Don't expect to sit down inside. Cashiers are friendly and will have fun talking to you as you slur every other word."
"1.0","I have been here before and WAS my favorite place in The Strip. It was a new cashier and she was very confused how to order the Corned beef sandwich.  Food came out at a few bites and it was the wrong corned beef sandwich.  Asked to get the RIGHT one I ordered. The MANAGER said I can BUY a NEW one since I ate some of it already!!So eat a few bites of the WRONG samdwhich and you'll have to buy a NEW one.Customer was wrong here?"
"4.0","I try to stop here every time I come to the Pittsburgh area! Great spot for middle-eastern cuisine at reasonable prices. My new favorite thing is the spicy chicken. The garlic naan is always a must get as well."

"5.0","Absolutely incredible staff and the most fantastic coffee milk stout!! The food is spectacular and their manager Matt was super welcoming and accommodating on their first week open!! Go check this place out and give them your money!!"
"5.0","Great service great location great cocktails    We were enjoying a warm afternoon on the north shore one Sunday and stopped for lunch. The drink menu might have more items on it than the food menu. I tried one called something like 'watermelon wave'. It was refreshing and not overly sweet...perfect!   I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich for lunch and it was well seasoned...flavorful and delicious. The fries were pretty darn good too.  Although we arrived at the restaurant during an unexpected rush, we sat outside and didn't mind the wait. We could see the fountain at the Point and a newlywed couple and their bridal party were taking photos in the nearby park so we just sat back and enjoyed a beautiful day in Pittsburgh."
"4.0","Hot food lovers unite ! Very specific menu with fingers or sandwiches. Mild is just that . Medium is getting there for sure, more like most buffalo style heat but just a different kind of heat. Fries rocked, fingers were very nice sized . Wished I could have remembered to ask for more dipping sauce because it was very good. Clean and people were nice . I saw they had some decent drafts as well. I will go back to try the hotter stuff."
"1.0","Not sure what was worse the waiter's B.O. (which was akin to a Mumbai locker room) or the fact that this place is most likely owned by the Gambino Crime Family....'Cash Only.' The wait is probably the most enjoyable part of this restaurant...which is at least 15-20 min. Our food arrived before we could take off our coats and the check came before I took my first bite of grease. The corned beef looked like mashed goat brains and the pancakes reminded me of Ethiopian sponge bread (apologies to Ethiopia). This is my second time at Pamela's (the first being above average) and most likely my last....unless for some reason I crave food poisoning."
"5.0","Great food. Great environment. We had a few beers and a bunch of appetizers. We went with the deep fried pickles, chicken quesadillas, buffalo chicken pitas, and pulled pork nachos. The deep fried pickles have the perfect amount of breading on them. The chicken quesadillas were packed full with chicken and veggies. I'd say the buffalo chicken pitas were the best! The pulled pork nachos were good, but nothing special. Kyle was our waiter and provided excellent service. I would definitely come back again!"
"4.0","This is an excellent restaurant.  The Samosa were great.  We ordered lamb biryani and chicken saag ad they were the best we've had in the city.  The waitress was also excellent.  Highly recommended!"
"2.0","I came back to Umami since my friend wanted to try this place. I made reservations surprise him and to make sure that we were going to be able to get a table. As soon as we got there, we got seated to our table. The atmosphere in this place was nice and relaxing. Our waitress was nice and attentive. To our disappointment, the food was not what we expected. We ordered takoyaki, sashimi platter, spicy tuna hand roll, udon and tonkatsu ramen. The takoyaki was overcooked and the texture was harder than other takoyaki that I've had tried. The hand roll was okay but so not worth $10. I got the udon which Is my go to but the udon was so salty that it was hard eating it. The most disappointing one was the ramen which had no flavor at all. Ramen usually has a really flavorful broth. This ramen had no flavor but the chilly oil and the meat tasted like nothing. We were very disappointed in our food as it was not worth spending over $80 (including tip) for this meal. I wouldn't recommend this place as there are other restaurants that offer better quality of food for a better price but if you're more concerned with atmosphere, by any means try it."
"5.0","Love Hardee's! Not sure if I like lunch or breakfast better  always awesome food. Service isn't bad either"
"5.0","Came here for lunch AND dinner in one day during a very short trip to Pittsburgh. I just had to write this review because no one has raved about their personal-pizza sized pide (i think they call it something else, but I call it pide). They make the bread there baked with several types of filing. I tried several--but i have to strongly recommend the spinach and feta! The spinach and feta pide was so delicious that I thought about it all afternoon after lunch, and knew it would only be right to go back here for dinner.  I wish I lived in pitt just so I can go here for lunch AND dinner. Still thinking about that pide. They have plenty of other food that are also so delicious.  They know how to cook here. Chicken breast can easily go dry and and lamb sometimes tastes very lamb-y and chewy. But that was not the case here. The tandoori chicken had fire but not at all oily that the spices lingered in your mouth even after brushing your teeth. Actually I wanted to keep eating just so that flavor would remain in my mouth. The lamb kebab was kebabed to perfection.Go ASAP and get a platter, and several of the spinach&feta pide for later and the next day. The price is right and a platter portion is more than enough for two people."
"3.0","A group of 4 of us dined here Friday.  We had the loaded nacho appetizer to start which was really very good.  I had the fried fish sandwhixh with fries.  The fiah was not crispy and the fries tasted stale, perhaps they needed to change the frying oil.  My husband's burger was cooked too rare.  The best meal at the table was the cobb salad with salmon ($16).  The salmon was nicely done.  The portions here are huge, but the food was touch and go."
"3.0","Do not get the Grown up Grilled cheese,it barely had enough cheese to hold the two pc of bread together, way over priced at $14.00.My husband did like his chicken sandwich. The service was friendly."
"4.0","A wonderful place to reconnect with family before hitting the road for home. I had a perfect straight ahead ham and cheese omelette. And the potatoes were both perfect and generous. I'll go back many more times to work my way threw the menu."
"2.0","I had an overall tasteless experience ( other than the only taste being distasteful. The Turkey sandwich  was tasteless, other than the strong bitterness of the vegetables on the sandwich. The quinoa salad( which I didn't order in the first place) tastes like rubber and a hint of brine at the first bite,and the strong coleslaw side was equal to that of the quinoa salad. Their aim is healthy eating but I guess that way is to not eat the Turkey sandwich or the others mentioned"
"5.0","If I were to turn into a vegetable, I know it would be a brussel sprout. I eat them almost daily. For the most part, I've stopped ordering them out because I cook them so often at home. However, Cinderlands...goodness ...they have a sprout dish with goat cheese and marcona almonds and pomegranates and oh my! I am salivating. The most perfect brussel spout dish ever. I'm so sick of seeing balsamic/parmesan/truffle sprouts on every menu. This dish was bright and beautiful and delicous! I also had a pale ale with black tea...bravo. The perfect pairing."
"4.0","Great pad Thai! The sauce has a strong peanut flavor.The spicy goes from 1-10 and 10 is actually extremely spicy. I gave it a 4/5 because of consistency. Some days there's not enough sauce in the pad Thai. Chicken satay and shrimp summer rolls are also great appetizers here"
"5.0","Came for take out, even after reading the reviews. I never bypass a chance for gluten free pizza. We found all of the things coming up as negative resolved. My daughter and I each had our own 'pizza maker', and both of them were friendly and proficient. And changed their gloves frequently. Pizza was very good (We both went with a design your own) And the gluten free was even good cold the next day, a real rarity. I definitely felt they took the service critique to heart, and I'd happily return."
"1.0","We 3 sat for a few minutes at lunch time without being greeted. We 3 sat for few more. Still nothing. We 3 like to smoke and drink especially after smoking and drinking the night before :) We 3 left :( You can trust me I'm in the business."
"4.0","My friends and I went here for brunch on a Tuesday. We chose to sit on the back deck because it was a nice day- and of course we wanted to see the legendary umbrellas! I ordered 'The Melted' sandwich which is chicken, pesto, mozzarella, and tomato. The sandwich was pretty good, but I wish the cheese would've been melted a little bit more. I think it would have been a better sandwich if it was pressed as a panini instead! The sandwich came with a side salad and a few sour cream and cheddar chips. Personally, there wasn't enough dressing on the salad for me, but it was filled with delicious, leafy greens. The owner (I think) was very kind. He offered to take pictures of us and brought us a free dessert of eclairs which I felt was extremely thoughtful! The biggest problem I had was the fact that they only serve mini bottles of water and you have to pay $0.50 for each bottle! I am a big water drinker and have no problem drinking from the tap, but here I was forced to pay for my water. I only drank two bottles, but in all actuality, I wanted to drink about 4."
"2.0","This place needs to work on their customer satisfaction!  Great tacos but horrible people skills. Pay attention to when you have customers sitting at the bar and not to the football game on your phone!"
"5.0","Best food truck in Pittsburgh! I just got a pork bowl and kimchi to go and I could tell from the smells on the way home that it was going to be amazing! It did not disappoint. Really great portion sizes for the price, you can definitely share with someone or have enough for two meals. I hope to see this food truck around more often."
"3.0","I eat here more often than I would like.  My friends sort of enjoy it and it's a convienent place for all of us to meet for lonk.  I think Mandarin Gourmet is better.The egg rolls are always mushy.  The outside is awesome, but it's cat poop with mushrooms inside.I think the meat/main portion of the meal is a bit slim while you get a ton of rice to try and fill you up.  The broccorri is acceptable.  The service is pretty lousy, but most Chinese places have lousy service.Paying for your meal is actually painless and they almost always split the check automatically.  Good stuff.It's very LOUD.  I have no idea why but it seems like the Chinese joints downtown are amplified.  I find myself yelling across the table to have a conversation.Go down the street and hit Mandarin Goumet instead.  The food is better.  Still loud and always crowded though."
"5.0","This place is great. It's tiny, so you want to make a reservation or be willing to sit at the bar. My favorites are the chirashi bowl and the udon. I'm not a big handroll fan, but the fish in the sushi is always fresh and delicious. They also do take out which is a plus if you don't feel like waiting."
"5.0","CAme Here before the Ariana Grande concert and it was absolutely amazing!!!!! I got the amazing chicken and won ton soup and my food was honestly the best Chinese  I've had in Pittsburgh. The homemade sauces are phenomenal"
"4.0","Decent food and pretty good service every time we've been there. Our last trip was in the morning before a Pitt game and we were still impressed with the food and service, but disappointed that they had NO breakfast options, though they were open before the 11am game. Warning: though good, the spinach/artichoke dip is VERY oily..."
"5.0","This is my favorite thai Place in Pittsburgh. I love curries pretty much everywhere and this place is no exception. Perhaps, not the most exquisite curry but they give you such generously sized portions. They don't skip on the meat. They also keep on refilling your rice. When I asked to take the remaining curry and rice home, the waitressoffered to give a fresh box to go. The staff is nice.TLDR;  you're getting your moneys worth here."
"5.0","This is easily one of the best Japanese restaurants I've been to. The food there is authentic and delicious. I ordered a bowl of ramen. Its presentation was on point and taste was even better. There are also countless amounts of exotic drinks to explore. Above all, though, is the atmosphere of this place. It's just so fun! With a live DJ, energetic waitstaff, and a good crowd, Umami is a go to for any evening out! Oh, it's also cool to note that I went to this restaurant for a friend's 21st birthday. We were able to reserve a really nice secluded room in the back (do recommend)!"
"5.0","Absolutely and positively the most amazing place I have ever been to. I am not from Pittsburgh and a friend recommended this place - it truly lived up to the expectations!! If you can, ask for George, he was one of the most gracious servers I have ever had :) ps. try the sweet potato fries - you will not be disappointed!"
"1.0","Ordered food using DoorDash. Food arrived 2 hours late. Barely received food no sure if this restaurant just has small pricey plates or they just didn't put food in my order. So disappointed money wasted. Spent $50 for two teriyaki chicken plates for me and my boyfriend. And the food we received didn't even look it was enough for 1 person combined. Never ordering from there again. Worst order ever."
"5.0","Don't be deceived by the nondescript 'PAMELA'S RESTAURANT' sign in the sketchy font out front. The interior of this place is cozily modern, and the food is fantastic:- Home fries: cooked to a mealy perfection, then smashed before frying in order to maximize their crisp-able surface area. They must put some kind of cheese in them to get it that lovely golden brown color and perfectly crunchy texture. - Hotcakes: kind of like a thick crepe, but better. Each bite is different - sometimes sweet, sometimes a little saltier, fruitier, other times crunchier. Delicious every single time. - Omelettes: Their egg white omelettes do a great job posing as normal eggs. The fillings are fresh and flavorful without overpowering the flavor of the egg. - Toast: Yes, even their toast is excellent. Crisp on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. And their toast comes pre-buttered - taking care of that pesky cold-butter-on-hard-toast problem.It's greasy spoon brunch fare at its very best. My parents ate here two days in a row, which says a lot because they're Asians from Asia and typically don't like greasy American-style brunch foods. I'm an Asian from America and typically don't like to agree with my parents, but I'll make an exception for Pamela's. This place is amazing."
"5.0","I've been quite satisfied both times I've been here. I'm a creature of habit and tend to order the same thing all the time. I love trying different things here, so many flavors, so filling and reasonable price. I look forward to trying something new next time"
"4.0","It was my first business trip, first time eating out by myself,  and I just wanted a beer and watch Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals to see the Blackhawks beat the Ducks. The service was friendly,  food good,  and the Hawks won. Nothing special about the burger I ate as it was your usual bar comfort food. The bartender was nice, which only added on top of the friendly service. Had a great conversation with random strangers about what it will be like once the Kenny Chesney concert let's out. Overall,  I enjoyed the experience and left feeling welcomed to the city of Pittsburgh."
"5.0","What a perfect find on the Strip for breakfast!  The ambiance is a blend of rustic old and new, very current with trends in restaurant spaces.  Wait staff friendly and prompt.  The feature food this morning was the ricotta pancakes!  Omelette a very close second.  Obviously higher end ingredients with flavor!  Satisfying to the palate and healthful!  Definitely will come back."
"1.0","Rude staff and the food is pretty bad. There are so many better places in Lawrenceville"
"2.0","Place was awesome the food to me was not great. I ordered Caesar salad not good to me i had to ask for extra dressing it was dry. To me tasted weird. We also ordered chicken pasta it has horrible sorry but no flavor I won't be going there again. The waiter was awesome the place beautiful / also not too many options on the menu. I was lost."
"5.0","Just tried Arepittas for the first time and it was great. I ordered a shredded beef arepa and a beef empanada. The arepa was one of the best things I've eaten in a while. Why is it that a lot of the best downtown restaurants are under parking garages? This place is a must try!"
"4.0","I really enjoyed the chicken tenders I got here and would definitely go back.  The one thing I didn't like, was the seasoning on the chicken and the french fries was VERY SALTY.  It was okay for me to deal with, but the friend I went with would probably give them 2 stars because it was way to much salt for her.  It was fast to get my order.  There's not a ton of seating, so if you're hoping to sit down to eat, make sure you don't come during the lunch rush.  There's not too much to say about a place that only serves fried chicken though.  If you like fried chicken, you'll like ChiKN."
"5.0","This location could quite possibly be the best Eat'n Park I have been to in my 3 years of living in Pittsburgh. From the time we walked through the door the service was A1. I especially want to take a second to talk about how great Amber (The server) is. She was attentive, easy to talk to, and generally amazing. (She got a good tip from everyone). As far as food goes... This seems like a top tier Eat'n Park. The bacon was perfectly crispy )how I asked for it), Buffalo chicken fingers were completely coated in buffalo sauce (some location have spotty with the sauce). Those were the highlights. I have a meeting in the area once a month so I will be back for a good meal and great service from Amber."
"5.0","I did not know what to expect walking in but I was beyond impressed with the ambiance, the service, and the FOOD. I appreciated that the vegetarian options were highlighted in green on the menu. I'm not a vegetarian but I'm not a big fish person. Japanese cuisine is mostly seafood but Umami offers a lot of other options. The food isn't something that you could make on its own, my tofu rice bowl was LEGIT. I will definitely be returning soon :)"
"5.0","This is a great bar in Lawrenceville. The brewed beer selection isn't large, but the selections are quite tasty with unique concepts (coffee sour, chocolate stout, fruity IPAs). For those who don't drink beer, options include wine and cocktails. I love when beer bars/breweries stock other alcohols for those who can't or don't drink beer. I didn't have the food, but it looked delicious from what I saw. Overall, the vibe is laid back and relaxed, the service good, and the beer definitely worth a visit."
"3.0","I have to say that I've had mixed experiences here. The meals I've had have been hit-or miss, but the buffets have always been satisfying (as long as I don't arrive at the end of it!). One of the first dishes I've got from here was vegetable Chettinad, an item not often on Indian menus, and for good reason. It's not terrible, but I imagine most people would never find occasion to order it a second time, as is the case with me. I quite enjoyed the presentation and taste of the navrattan korma, which is very nicely topped with a cherry that adds to the dish in a pleasantly different way. However, I can't get past the notion that the ingredients are rather cheap-ish; while I cannot be sure, I get the impression that the vegetables are canned, as are many of the tomato-based sauces I find myself eating. Very recently I also had a mango lassee that was somehow off... at first it was served to me warm, which my waiter happily corrected, but even chilled, it had a syrupy texture, and less yogurt-y like I had wanted. Part of the premise behind ordering a mango lassee is so the dairy in the beverage neutralizes the acidity/spiciness of what you're eating. I didn't have to wait for my food to arrive to realizing what I was served would fail to serve that role. The waiter, however, was very accommodating and took it off my bill. Yet I feel that lassees I've had in the past were just fine. I realize this may be a silly thing to split hairs over, but it confuses me nonetheless.I'm willing to take this in stride, though. Tamarind is in a very good location, and has very low prices, especially with the buffet. A common trend among restaurants is that lower menu prices correlate with cheaper ingredients, and Tamarind is no exception. I still have to qualify that the food here is still much better than other Pittsburgh-area Indian restaurants that share its price level. Because of this, I don't find it too hard to  look past this reality and simply allow myself to enjoy the experience."
"5.0","The BEST Thai food in Pittsburgh and my husband would argue that it's the best food in general. We order the same meals every time and the staff knows us very well. Perfect dinner spot!"
"5.0","Amazing tacos for a great price! They're daily specials are great and the staff are friendly!"
"5.0","Really great taco joint in the heart of Pittsburgh's Strip District. Edgar is super nice and friendly. I ended up getting 3 tacos (super cheap and very good) and elote. The elote was the best I've had in the states. He made sure our food and experience was great. If you're in the mood for tacos, don't pass this place up. Plus, there are a lot of great bars and wineries around!"
"5.0","The sign outside said 'try and old fashioned at The Summit'.  I did and it was fantastic.  This is my 'go to' cocktail and theirs is as good as I've had.  Too bad we'd already had dinner because there were a bunch of things on the menu I wanted to try.  Can't wait to come back!"
"3.0","A solid burger place to have in the neighborhood. The flavors of the veggie burger itself were overpowering but I'd be open to trying to some of the other selections. The toppings were fresh and flavorful."
"5.0","Been here a few times.  It's awesome when you can find a seat and it's awkward when you can't.   Really great in the summer when they open the garage doors up.  They make awesome drinks and the bar tenders are really great and friendly.   They recently started serving food and from what I have heard it is pretty good but it is a limited menu.  Check out my IG @lookwhatIcaneatrightnow"
"1.0","I park outside on the street of Panera so I could run in and grab a bite to eat.  Well, I didn't have quarters, and when I asked the girl at the counter if I could exchange my dollar for 4 quarters so I could feed the meter while I ate, she looked at me like I was crazy and said 'I can't give you change.'  ..... How the hell am I supposed to park and eat if I do not have change and you are unwilling to exchange a dollar for me.  I know it might be company policy to not open the register, but do not roll your eyes at me and get an attitude.  Gracias para nada."
"4.0","This restaurant has a cool and casual feel and lives up to it's name serving some great burgers.  The burgers are $13 and for $1 you can upgrade your fries to rosemary fries, which is a must!  The food comes out on mismatched china, which I love.  I had the morningside burger which was topped with American cheese, egg, bacon, and mayo and it was delicious!  I was also able to get a Groupon and save some money which made the food taste even better.  I would definitely check Groupon before you go in case there is a deal!  Burgh'ers also brews their own beer, which I haven't tried yet, but I look forward to it on my next visit!  Overall, I think Burgh'ers is a great addition to Lawrenceville!"
"4.0","Note: I've only been a patron for lunch; I'll update my review after I visit for dinner.We ended up heading over to Sausalido for lunch since it's always been on my list of restaurants to try and I was in the mood to enjoy a full meal instead of the quick drop-in for takeout or a sandwich.Upon arriving, we noticed we were the only patrons of the restaurant at the time (around 12:45 PM).  Yes it was a bit unexpected, but it meant we got the full attention of the waitress and we could be seated anywhere we liked.  While we looked over the menu, she brought out a bread plate with a white bean dip drizzled with olive oil, balsamic vinegar and topped with red peppers.  The dip was delicious and we had no problem finishing everything.  Later she brought out three freshly made bowls of seafood chowder, compliments of the chef.  She noted with a laugh, 'one the perks of being the only customers right now.'  The seafood chowder was chock-full of fish, scallops, mussels, and shrimp.  The base of the soup itself was flavorful and light, not like traditional chowders bogged down with heavy cream.  My two companions decided to start out with two more cups of the seafood chowder while I opted for their Capon and Ditalini soup, a chicken noodle soup offered every day.  My soup is freshly prepared with their house chicken stock with wilted spinach and topped with cheese.  I preferred the seafood chowder, but I have to note that the chicken stock had multiple layers and many subtle flavors.For our entrees I ordered their gnocci, and my companions ordered their crab cakes and their flank steak.  My gnocci is advertised as 'house made', but realistically it was brought in from elsewhere.  It was served with braised lamb in a tomato ragout and topped fish fresh basil and freshly grated cheese.  The flavors were all there, but I like my gnocci with a bit more of a bite to it.  The braised lamb was a bit tough and ended up detracting from the dish as opposed to improving it.  The crab cakes were pretty good, but would've been slightly more epic if the lump meat was a bit larger.  It's a pretty small portion, so do make sure you order a soup to go along with it.  The flank steak was served medium rare topped with a horseradish creme fraiche with smashed potatoes.  The steak was excellent; cooked well and flavorful from being marinated and seasoned properly.  The smashed potatoes were a bit too cheesy for my liking, but I like how smashed potatoes have lots of textures going on with mild lumps of potato and potato skin in the mix.Sausalido is BYOB, so you can bring your own bottle and you definitely should ($2 corkage fee per person).  Lots of entrees from the lunch menu have encore presentations on the dinner menu; however, there are new dishes as well such as a duck breast, scallops, and a pork chop.There aren't too many seats in the restaurant, so for dinner I'd recommend calling ahead for reservations just to be on the safe side."
"1.0","Who needs oversized 'security guards' harassing people at an upscale establishment?  This place has a really strange vibe!!!  Will not be going back."
"3.0","Made a visit to LW's about a half hour before closing on a Friday. No problem getting quickly seated and served, but it kind of bums you out when you're informed it's your last chance to get a drink before your entree has even arrived. They have to figure a better way to operate so that late arriving customers aren't shortchanged on the experience and offerings. Perhaps have drinks available for seated guests only? Keep the bar open an hour later? I don't know, but figure something out. Aside from that, the place was decent. I went with a Caesar salad and the hot pepper encrusted tuna. Both were fresh and tasty, and portions appropriate. The prices were just a tad high but despite all of this, I think I'd give them another shot when in town."
"5.0","We had a really great time visiting Ciderlands on Saturday night! They were busy, but had plenty of seating available in their back dining area. Hip atmosphere, passionate staff, these people are very confident in what they are offering: great beers and a menu that's full of unexpected gourmet flavor. For dinner we tried the hot chicken sandwich and switched out the fries for a marinated kale salad that was so good we had to order more. Kale salad was drenched in lemon juice, olive oil, chili pepper and feta cheese. Delicious and yet so simple! The chicken was also excellent! For a side plate we tried the dates wrapped in bacon- they were awesome. Can't wait to return the next time we venture out to Lawrenceville!"
"5.0","Look!  Eat here and experience great food.  Great food, and dirt cheap prices.  The quantity of food you receive will make it almost impossible to finish.  The people working there are great to chat with, and are good at making suggestions.  They have a market attached.  I wish they would offer cooking classes."
"1.0","We usually come here to get food without an issue. Just recently there has been a new employee who always messes up orders and is very rude. If we place an order for something we get something else. If we call for meat he hangs up, is rude, and very inconsiderate. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone anymore until the staff is taught how to work properly FOR THE CUSTOMER."
"5.0","I stopped in today for lunch and was greeted immediately. Looking at the menu on the board, I wasn't sure what ingredients were included. The staff person pointed me to a side menu that listed everything. Nice looking out. The ingredients were mainly organic. There were two veggie options, so I chose Tuscan Garden, which had more veggies. It wasn't a long wait before it was ready. After it came out, I was asked about addition finishings that included parmesan cheese, basil, and arugula! Life is better with arugula. I then made my way to the condiment bar which featured oil and peppers. Added some red pepper flakes and made my way back to the office. I sat down and prepared myself for lunch. Delicious. Warm. I ate half the flatbread, saving the rest for another lunch. Very solid option in the neighborhood. At $8 for the featured flatbread or create your own, it's a reasonable option."
"1.0","I won't be in the mood for Indian food in a long time after this visit to Tamarind. To start off, we were barely greeted and then even though the restaurant was empty they seated us next to someone who was on a date. The tables were so close it felt like we were sitting with them. It was really uncomfortable and awkward. Then another person was seated also in the same corner of the restaurant, the rest of the place was still empty. Now let's talk about the food.... we weren't given the option to look at a menu so we had no choice but to eat the buffet. The food in the buffet was pretty awful. Tandoori chicken was cold and looked like it had been out all day. There were no normal chicken recipes like tika masala or butter chicken only some weird variations that were okay. There were no naans only a few hard pieces from earlier in the day. For desert they had two options both which did not taste good. No one came to take our dirty plates in between rounds or to ask if the food was okay. Also, no one asked if we wanted a drink other than water which is a little strange. Overall, the whole experience was weird and I hope they can improve their service."
"5.0","The best of the best... top notch facility and quality food... filet hollandaise was unreal... pricewise is high but you get what you pay for.  Great dim atmosphere My go to for special occasions"

"2.0","Very average Italian food.  If you're looking for a pasta+sauce experience, it's pretty boring.  Eggplant parm was a little better than average.  But all in all, not any more exciting than what I can make for myself with a jar of sauce and box of pasta."
"5.0","This is probably the best kept secret in Pittsburgh. When visiting Pittsburgh, one of the first things that most people do is take a trip up one of the two inclines to see the picturesque view of the city from Mount Washington. After you've gotten your fill of Instagram photos, venture over to Shiloh Street and check out the relaxing vibes at The Summit. They will greet you will a friendly staff that is very knowledgeable about their craft. They have an ever changing cocktail menu that is one of the best in the city. It's also one of the larger menus that you'll come across with something for everyone. They also boast a nice selection of local and national craft beers on tap as well as a unique selection of bottles and cans. Pull up a seat at the bar or bring a group and grab a table. They also have a nice selection of board games to play. Even the trip to the restroom is interesting with bright and colorful graffiti lining the walls down the stairs and into the bathrooms. At the end of the night, you'll leave feeling like a regular."
"4.0","Summit is one of my favorite spots to grab a drink with friends ! Such an awesome vibe & delicious cocktails. Wednesday nights they have name that tune, it's a total blast ! The only downside is no TVs ! Get the cucumber press if you're looking for a refreshing drink, but they are known for the old fashions !"
"3.0","I have been to two capital grille restaurants. The one in king of Prussia is the best service I have ever gotten from any restaurant anywhere! And not just once! Every time I go the food and service is beyond compare. Lobster Mac n cheese is amazing!The one in Pittsburgh has decent food and the service is okay but it isn't anything to write home about. I would rather go elsewhere."
"5.0","I've tried a lot of steak and italian hoagies in the east end and they may be the best and the prices are very good and the daily special of a whole hoagie for $5.99 is almost the same as a half hoagie at other places.Someone wrote a review about eating hoagies and being sick and well I've eaten many hoagies from them and never been sick."
"4.0","After learning that there was a 45 minute wait at Spaghetti Warehouse,  we opted to go to Luke Wholey's.  We chose to to sit at the bar and ordered a couple of drinks. We studied the menu and decided on an oyster appetizer (all the hubby.... & at 1/2 off).... Lobster Mac n cheese,  provolone wedges & chicken poppers with Buffalo sauce. Everything came out in a timely manner.  Jayme (the bartender)  was friendly without being over bearing. The hubs loved his oysters & lobster Mac.  I really enjoyed my provolone wedges & chicken poppers. I was honestly full on just the cheese wedges!  There was a young man shucking (is that the right word?!)  oysters and the owner must not have liked how he was doing it because he came over,  scolded the kid and started doing it himself.  It was really unprofessional,  especially because we were sitting less than 3 feet away and could hear everything! We will be back..... But not because of the owner,  but rather for the food and service."
"3.0","I was really excited about this menu...   Everything looked fresh and delicious and I was pumped to have some healthy options.  The execution of this menu, though, fell a little short.   I ordered a salad and a sandwich and a glass of wine.  The salad was quinoa, apples, lettuce, cheese, etc.  It was under-dressed and under-seasoned, but otherwise a good concept.   The sandwich was really where I had the problem.  The menu description didn't really say either way, but I sort of expected it to be hot since it was a grilled chicken variety.   It was served cold, though, which was fine.  What wasn't fine was the ratio of fixins to bread.  Way off.  I could barely taste the meat, sauce, etc. - there just wasn't enough of it and there was entirely too much bread.  And I am a bread lover, so that is saying something.  All of my companions who ordered sandwiches had the same problem.   Those who ordered soup fared better - the soups all got good reviews.  The quiche also looked really good.  I just can't get past that skimpy sandwich though.  As far as seating, it was definitely limited.  I snagged a table in the back next to some really LOUD families.   It's a caf√©, so I didn't mind it.   There were a lot of people waiting for seats though.  Overall, a decent lunch place (skip the sandwiches though).  Not really a dinner vibe for me."
"4.0","Finally. I've found awesome Indian food in Pittsburgh. And it's within crawling distance of my apartment. And they're open for reasonable hours. I really am kicking myself for being a chicken and not trying it sooner. It tastes like home cooking made with quality ingredients and love. Got the Chicken Biryani and there was enough for three more meals. I went back and got bread and some extra cucumber sauce. Looking forward to trying everything. The burgers (made with Halal meat) looked gorgeous. Would give it 5 stars but the ordering process is a bit chaotic. There's definitely a learning curve for the newbie. But it's well worth it."
"5.0","Great mom and pop family owned place. Immediately felt welcomed which was a great start. The duck board special with chrysanthemum tea was amazing. The price was reasonable and I will definitely be back when I am back in town. I like mild Thai spice and these folks do it right. Don't miss this place."
"5.0","Ryan H.  Was a great server.  The large steak fries are awesome and they make a great burger cooked to perfection.  I didn't love the red beard sauce and that is because I don't like mustard if you love mustard go for it.  I would order without the sauce next time.  Why Ryan was so great we came in after the steelers game place was packed.  He said it would be better to get our whole order at once before the crowd grew and it did.  Saved us a ton of time.  Had a great experience."
"5.0","So far we've had the amazing Bloody Mary's  oysters and lobster bisque fries. We visit from California and count the minutes till we can come here!  We are still waiting for our entrees... Food heaven We had hot pepper crusted seared ahi. Grilled yellowtail with wasabi sauce. Seafood pasta. So fantastic. Everything was perfectly cooked with amazing flavors. We got to meet Mr Wholey Sr. An absolutely wonderful man that took us on an art tour thru the restaurant and made this trip a memorable one for sure. Service was fantastic our server  Davin was wonderful. Sweet and helpful. Can hardly wait to visit again!!! Thank you"
"1.0","We arrived a few minutes late (but called to give them a heads up) and apparently that meant waiting an extensive amount of time to be seated. Granted, I know how annoying it is not to be punctual, but it seemed a little excessive.Steaks all arrived in the wrong temperature. Either undercooked or overcooked. Also, the tuna steaks had been seared (and in one case, completely cooked through) when the request was for them to be raw. Honestly, I don't know that any one out of our group of eight had one dish right.The server was nice, and our table was a prime people watching spot. I'd give them points on the desserts, the lobster mac n cheese and the Malbec. But for the price, my expectations were high."
"5.0","Some of the best Chinese food in the Burgh. I am obsessed with their shrimp egg rolls, they are by far the best I have had since Lotus Garden in Brentwood closed a few years back. My family & I have a tradition to go out for Chinese on New Years Eve & this spot was no disappointment. Parking was a breeze as there is a small parking lot next to the restaurant- how refreshing for Downtown! We all loved our meals- honey sesame chicken, general tsos chicken, wonton soup, crab rangoons, shrimp fried rice and chicken chop suey- everything was fabulous and the oolong tea was the perfect compliment to it all. The service was out of this world as well, even when the restaurant started to get pretty busy. Love this place!"
"1.0","Sept 11 2019.... I am a  regular customer here and even though I noticed the decline in service and the mouse droppings ... I would (notice I say would)eat here when I wanted Indian food. I ordered to go and when I checked my order the chutneys for the samosa were not there .... At first the one gentleman lied and said they were in there until I showed him otherwise. Now please note we are talking about a 1oz serving of mint sauce here.  Another associate proceeded to tell me it would be extra and brought over a menu to prove me wrong and told me 'I could have it this time but next time I have to pay' ..,, now I've been coming here since it opened and never paid for this 1oz of chutney which was terrible and they give it to you free when you dine in...so I get home and the samosa was grease laden, the chicken saag was bitter and the rice was crunchy..., I went back the next day They accused me of eating half, told me I should've used naan and insisted on making me another saag,but at that point they lost a long time customer go to Masala House they're slow but polite and clean"
"3.0","Great atmosphere and tasty pastries! I got vanilla cream & chocolate chips in croissant and apricot pastry. They were both tasty! There's so many good looking pastries I wanted to try so I definitely will come back. They had pastry samples on the counter so you can try those and have little taste of each yummy stuff. By the way, service and coffee were just a OK."
"5.0","This was the second time I have been to Mezzo and I have not had a bad experience. The service is impeccable, even down to the bussers everybody is polished and seemingly intelligent. I would encourage you to plan to come here early and check out the rooftop bar which is absolutely amazing. At dinner we started with the Chef's Selection which is the Chef's Selection of Charcuterie, Cheeses, and Preserves, as well as bread. This plate was phenomenal and each pairing was better than the last. Additionally we ordered the poached pear appetizer and it was extremely well done overall. With goat cheese and Brussels sprouts this unique dish really will have you thinking.Onto my meal - I stuck with what in most cases would be considered the boring choice 'Spaghetti and Meatballs'. However, this amazing dish has such a rich taste that it was anything but the boring. The meatballs were perfectly crafted, marinara with ricotta cheese, and basil to top it all off. Incredible experience yet again, I just wished I ordered a second dish to bring home."
"5.0","We were so happy with our breakfasts!  Fiance got the American Breakfast and raved about the homefries and also his Intelligentsia coffee.  I enjoyed a Paposeco and Meia Leite.  I'm so excited about the food offered here and can't wait to visit again to try another item off the menu!"
"3.0","Stopped in for dinner for a bachelor party before going out. The food was average, nothing extraordinary. We ordered tatchos as an appetizer and they were the best part of the meal. I ordered the black and bleu burger and ordered it medium; it came out extra well done and was very dry. I ordered a bourbon smash and it came out in a tiny plastic cup. When I got it, the cup was only 3/4 of the way full and there was a ton of ice. What really was disappointing was they charged me $14 for a sub par drink!!The service was very slow. It took over an hour for our appetizers to come out (tatchos, quesadilla, and a buffalo chicken flatbread). We were at the restaurant for over 2.5 hours because it took another 50 minutes for our meals to come out after our appetizers. Very disappointing.I probably wouldn't return in the future, but if I did, I would try either the artery clogging fried cheeseburger or fried Italian hoagie."
"1.0","I used to frequent jb grille alot for years because i liked the food, so i stopped down last monday afternoon to get something to eat and this is what i saw in the bathroom and there was probably maybe 20 people total in the place, the bar incredibly sticky, as in, not clean. I had 1 drink and left, not coming back unless they start cleaning the place better, very very disappointed"
"5.0","The banana chocolate chip pancakes are the ultimate evolution of the pancake. Not since mankind first invented batter has their been a more revolutionary flavor experienced by a breakfast-seeking individual. These compliments are coming from someone who actively avoids breakfast and doesn't take pancakes very seriously. This endorsement could not come from a harsher critic of breakfast.In other news, the corned beef hash is very good. The service is friendly and the space is nice. Protip: Go when they open to avoid the line because they fill up fast."
"1.0","Horrible service at the bar it was like we were invisible. Would never ever recommend this bar what a joke. Manager finally got the attention of a bartender and did not comp our drinks!"
"1.0","One star for good service. My girlfriend and I got day old food. When you can get edible food from fast food, what's the point of eat n park. I could actually taste the cooks hatred of life, and his job."
"4.0","Food was excellent, especially the miso ramen. Nice sake selection. DJ was just getting set up as we left, so I presume they spin some tunes into the night. You lose one star for your pretentious hipster bartenders. I don't like being looked down on while I try to enjoy my dinner; puts my appetite off!"
"2.0","I didn't have a drink at the bar, but one look around told me I would love this place as a bar. It's just the kind of dusty , down to earth, sparsely filled  place I like getting my drink on at and I will surely be back to sit at the bar and slow life down for awhile and have a brew.  It should be also  be noted that I have now found a new location to procure 16oz cans!!! I stopped in on my half hour lunch break and ordered a roast beef sandwich. The roast beef was warmed which I wasn't expecting. For me I like my roast beef served with cheddar cheese...cheddar cheese isn't exotic...but for some reason Sammy's doesn't have cheddar *frown...and I requested brown mustard none of that either. So what I got was meat, lettuce and tomato with a large drink the total for my sammich  and drink $8.00.  That makes for an expensive lunch.  Way more then the $4.85 I'm use to spending on my 6in Italian BMT....I'll be updating this once I see how the bartenders get down...but for now 3 stars the sandwich was way to expensive for what it was. No cheddar no 5 stars."
"5.0","great food. good vibes. chill music. chirashi bowl is amazing. I haven't had a bad dish here. service is always top notch."
"3.0","Really disappointed. Just order chicken tikka for lunch via postmates.  The chicken was dry, minimal sauce (which was probably the most flavorless tikka masala I've ever had) and the salad had zero dressing on it.   Will give them another shot but really disappointed."
"5.0","Went to a late lunch, so my daughter ordered the Greek wrap and I ordered the spinach and feta omelette with mushrooms:) it was very good, we split so we could try both. The Greek wrap is full of flavor. The portions are huge and the price is very affordable. We will definitely come back."
"5.0","Stop by on our way to the Strip District!!! If decor is what your looking for then don't stop here BUT if AMAZING food at a reasonable price....STOP ON IN!!! We had the Chicken Tikka Masala, Spinach Paneer and Lentil Soup!!!! DEEEEEE LISH US!"
"3.0","Redbeard's was definitely a great place to watch some March Madness basketball on big screen TVs and have good food at the same time. I had the tee time burger, which had a beef patty excellently paired with a fried egg. The waffle sweet potato fries were pretty tasty, and the server also was very attentive towards me. Overall, the experience was good, but there wasn't a uniquely different vibe that set this sports bar apart from many other good sports bars."
"5.0","So I drunkenly stumbled into this place a year ago and the tacos were amazing then. Of course, I couldn't remember where I had gone until a friend told me it was right by twelve. I finally made it back and its even better sober. By far, the BEST place in Pittsburgh to get tacos. You will never be disappointed, no matter what you choose."
"5.0","I've wanted to try Arnold's Tea for a long time but I'm never on the North Side. I've heard so many great things about it Arnold's Tea and have heard that it's black owned. I stumbled in on a nice summer day. Perfect for an iced tea. I went with the twisted ginger. It was great and refreshing. Loved the actual pieces of ginger and slices of lemon. There was lots of space to sit and work and the interior looked comfy and inviting. I will definitely be back when I'm on this side of time!"
"3.0","My sister-in-law and i stopped in late night for some pizza and wings. I had never been here before but knew it would be open so we the 5 minute drive here. The menu offers a large list of things.. including deep dish pizza.We ordered a regular pizza and plain wings. The wings were delicious.. crispy and by no means a wing ding. Pizza was average but eh whatever. We were all starving.The guy taking our order was a total sweetie. We enjoyed a beer while waiting for the food. A cool thing about Gennaro's is that they sell (& DELIVER!) beer. You can mix & match six packs or buy them individually (not sure if that option is avail for delivery) Next time i will pass on the pizza and try some thing else"
"5.0","Came here on a fairly busy Saturday night after visiting Grist House in Millvale to satisfy a late night (drunk) craving for some good grub. Had the spicy fried chicken sandwich with french fries, along with their equivalent of an old fashioned (with cayenne pepper), and it was great to keep my buzz going. The chicken sandwich was savory and hit the spot, and the french fries were crispy, salty, and amazing. Would definitely return here when in the area!"
"4.0","Good value for money especially from our experience with Boston and NYC restaurants. Service could be better, nothing major but small things that matter - like getting all food out together. Food is tasty and authentic."
"5.0","We visited the restaurant this past Friday and the food and service were so excellent that we decided to return today Sunday during our short visit to Pittsburgh. Tonight we were greeted by Aisha who remembered us and welcomed us back. Our server Keith was professional and gave great menu and drink advice and the GM Blaze came to see that we were satisfied with our meal. Food was excellent, drinks were great, attention was exceptional without being oppressive, space is well designed and inviting- i hope we can return in nicer weather, all aspects of service were outstanding.Over the two days we had the octopus and beef tartare (twice), the meat and cheese board, sausage fennel pizza and the shrimp diavolo."
"1.0","This review for the management. I ordered  whole sheep as meal for my friend as graduation celebration. It started when i agree with him for 4 dishes for $400 and i told management that on Saturday some one will pick up the meal. On Saturday my friend went to pick up the order and the management played him and told him that they didnt make the meal but they will give another one for $477. I was really angry for playing me and cheating on my friend. My friend agreed to pay the extra money so he would get the meal so the invited people can eat. At that time when my friend picked up the meal, i called the office to get explanation. He said i saved your situation and get another sheep for extra money' i was like what without telling me or calling me'  i said to him my deal was $400 and not $477 , he said i ll give you credit for $77 at that time i knew he stole my money. I told him i need my money cash not credit he said i wont pay anything. This whole story was lesson for me and i wont back to that thief and liar manager. Be aware Saudi students in Pittsburgh and Indiana not to order from this dude in Salem halal"
"5.0","Great Dogs! Snappy frank's on great bread. All condiments are top quality. Burgers are d'licious as well, uses fresh good beef. Cheese steaks as well are top quality. Favorite food truck in the burgh. When this truck is at a brewery it makes the beer taste better."
"4.0","Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon, moderately busy but they got people through fast.  Ordered a mild chicken sandwich and mac and cheese with a drink. Hubs got 5 chicken strips (mild) with mac and cheese and a drink. It was a bit more expensive then one would have assumed at $26. The place was clean and staff was nice. They give you a round pager and you place it on the little card sensor at the edge of your table..pretty high tech. so they know where you are. The sandwich has alot of seasoning on it and I was thankful I only got mild. It also has coleslaw and a thousand island type dressing which is good because it takes some of the heat away but it was delish and cooked to my liking. ( they don't play with the heat so I would suggest taking it slow at 1st) The mac and cheese was thick but good.  Would go back if I was in the area but not make a special trip."
"5.0","So good and such a cool spot!! We arrived right before 5, and there were a few others. No regular seating available, but we got two seats at the bar, which IMO is always a bummer, but in a small spot like this, you settle for the bar seats because it's actually interesting to watch them cook. We literally purchased one thing per section on the menu because me and my mom DO. NOT. MESS. AROUND. lol but actually we don't. We are pigs. Yolo. A list of the foods we ordered, rated hahah:- beef tenderloin (9/10) sooo flavorful - salmon robata (9/10) perfectly cooked, so much flavor - sashimi maguro (7/10) just plain tuna. Nothing overly exciting - sake nigiri (10/10) my favorite kind of sushi so duh it's 10/10- temaki hamachi (8/10) interesting; first time trying raw yellow fish and I liked it- edamame (8/10) a little undercooked but tasty- pork & shrimp shumai (8/10) I liked it. Mom didn't. Idk how you wanna take that. Personal preference I guess bc they're not like normal dumplings. My mom said it's like a meatball hahahah- yaki udon (10/10) SO GOOOOOD ORDER THIS! Such a cool take on ramen. No brothI recommend ordering one of each if you're feeling like absolutely balling out. It's worth it. You deserve it, tbh. Do it."
"2.0","UPDATE:The management at Prince of India has since reached out to me and said they have made some positive changes as a result of my experience. They have invited me back free of charge to give them a second try. I am willing to take them up on this offer, but I am not sure when my schedule will allow it. That being said, I feel it is important to mention that they took this step to provide excellent customer service. In the meantime, I'll add a star."
"5.0","Wow. Just wow. The food, the service, the ambiance... this place really hits a home run. The happy hour menu was incredible with cheap food, cheap booze, their cocktails were delicious. We had fried chicken and dumplings and different sticks full of mouth watering meat. The octopus balls were sublime. I will shove those balls in my mouth 7 out of 7!!!  It was such a fantastic experience I can't wait to go back"
"2.0","I wasn't really a fan. In fact, this may hae been some of the most sub-par Italian food I've had (it seemed very touristy), and it was definitely my least favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh while traveling there on business the past few months. Cute ambiance! Cute neighborhood! Friendly local wait staff! But kinda touristy & uninteresting food pairings / ingredients."
"4.0","Came in here for a beer before dinner. Bar area was jammed and hard to get a standing spot. I had one of the darker brews, which I really liked. Small selection but all seemed really good and interesting. Bar thinned out as we were there. Didn't stay for food but menu looked interesting."
"4.0","J and I frequently attend this small Southside joint when we are in the mood for tacos. The tacos are delicious here with very flavorful ingredients. The last time we went, I ordered two chicken tacos and J ordered two beef tacos. Each taco is $3, so two tacos each is filling and cost effective. The cooks are very nice and cook your food quickly, despite having a crowd. We definitely recommend this place for a quick bite to eat or for every Taco Tuesday."
"4.0","The mushroom bruschetta and vegan chili was very very tasty.  The soup tasted so fresh and had the perfect seasoning.  The mushroom bruschetta was almost 5 stars.  But the bread was burnt on the one side which made it really tough to eat.  But the flavors of the mushrooms with the onions and balsamic had a great flavor and consistency of the ingredients.  I wasn't expecting such a tasty meal while going to look at plants lol."
"5.0","Meals expertly planned and delivered!  great tableservice and decent pricing for an upscale Steak house.  Chappellet red fusion vino was a perfect welcomed compliment to my Sliced Filet with mushrooms and baby onions and my brothers Filet Oscar was cooked medium to perfection.  The lobster crab cake appetizer was delicious ..homemade tartar sauce was a perfect topping. Fresh made mint lemonade and the dimly lit restaurant and all its beauty sealed the deal for a perfect meal.  When in Pittsburgh this place is a Must!"
"5.0","My husband and I went to Cafe Raymond to see what all the buzz was about, and we were NOT disappointed! We went around 10:30 on a Sunday and it wasn't overly crowded. There were a few people in line ahead of us, but we didn't wait to order our food for no more than 5 minutes. The staff was super friendly from the second we walked in the door to the time we left. Once we sat down, our food was in front of us before we knew it. I got the ham & Gruyere croissant with an added egg, and my husband got the NY smoked salmon platter. Everything was so fresh!! We also split a raspberry and cheese danish, and it was delicious! One thing we couldn't help but notice was how CLEAN everything was. Everything was wiped down, the kitchen is open so we could see it all and it looked like everything was brand new. Maybe it was, but it looks like they run a tight ship, and we were very pleased about that. We will definitely be back soon. I have to try those pancakes I've been hearing so much about!"
"5.0","i was recommended by a friend to try this place. ordered the blackened catfish (recomended by the same friend. and let me just say it was fantastic!!! i ordered the sandwich it came on a french baguette type roll and was topped with fresh romain lettuce, two thick slices of what tasted like homegrown tomatoes and two rings of red onion. atmosphere is casual and the wait staff is great."
"5.0","An Oakland staple. Best tikka massala in the city."
"4.0","I came here with my friends during lunch. The place is set up as a cafeteria which we didn't mind since there were plenty of seats. There was a variety of food which we could pick from. I got the lamb curry which was delicious!! The portions are huge and so worth the price that you pay for. I would definitely go back! Even though the place doesn't look too nice, the food has been delicious!  Everyone liked what they ordered."
"1.0","Waited 1/2 hour for service after seating. Entrees arrived 2 at a time (soup was cold). Two entrees did not arrive at all. Awful"
"2.0","We were in the mood for no-frills Chinese food while visiting Pittsburgh. We found this place on Yelp and gave it a try. It has a parking lot next door which was a huge plus. We were seated immediately upon arrival. We ordered egg rolls for the entree which arrived lukewarm. For my entree I ordered General Tso's chicken which was again lukewarm and soggy. The fried rice was amazing, the best part of the meal. We also ordered egg foo yung. The patty itself was good but the gravy was thin and sweet, I'm used to thick savory gravy for egg foo yung. Kudos for the fried rice, I would highly recommend it but everything else was not memorable for me."
"5.0","This is my favorite Japanese restaurant!I think this restaurant serves the most authentic Japanese cuisines here in Pittsburgh.(I am Japanese... so...you know what I mean?)"
"5.0","Probably the best burger I've had in Pgh. The fries were also perfect. A little disappointed with the chocolate shake. The service was fantastic and the restaurant is very comfortable."
"1.0","Ordered a delivery through Grubhub, as I was in a semi hurry. They quoted a 1 hour delivery and I agreed and ordered. At the 1 hour mark, I received a call from Beta Bites stating their driver delivered my food to another house (not sure I believe that) and that they were willing, yes willing, to make me a new order and send it out. I stated that I could not wait and please refund my credit card. The gentleman suggested I call Grubhub, or he could call. I called, only to be told I could wait up to five days for a refund. HAHAHA. Never again! The shame is.... I liked Grubhub and used them quite often. Really guys, get it together, a little customer service may go a long way. Try it."
"4.0","Very nice classic Pittsburgh neighborhood Italian.  Best choice for hearty, simple popular Italian dishes  I took my parents there for dinner and we all enjoyed our meal.  My mom loved her chicken parm.  My clam sauce with whole wheat pasta was absolutely perfectly al-dente.  Salad is fresh with a very nice balsamic vinagrette.  Wedding soup was a bit salty, but otherwise perfectly fit my conception of what wedding soup should be.  Dad had the tortilla soup (I know; odd choice) and he liked it quite a bit.  Standout item was the beans & greens which were very fresh.  Service was excellent.  Atmosphere is a bit dated and very Pittsburgh, but if you are looking for decent American Italian at good prices with good service, highly recommend."
"5.0","Stopped here for lunch while my son and I were in the Strip district shopping around. The place had pretty much just opened, and we had the place to ourselves for a while. My boy was attracted by the fact they serve sushi (11 year old aficionado), so he selected a tuna roll as well as the salmon with sweet soy for his entre, while I picked some blackened shrimp.The server was very attentive and solicitous throughout the meal, even as others arrived to eat. When the food came, the boy was very happy with the sushi ('This is terrific! Try a piece!'); he really enjoyed his salmon as well. My shrimp was very tasty, and we both enjoyed the jasmine rice and steamed broccoli; the sweet soy feathered across the plates made for a wonderful presentation.I think the lad has a new favorite seafood restaurant, and I'll give him no guff when he wants to return. Terrific food and service, in a venue with decor that, for the kiddo, brought a chuckling Sponge Bob reference to mind.Great place to eat! Well done!"
"4.0","um ridiculously good and so quick and filling. I shared the hotcakes and got a side of eggs and sausage. need both my sweet and savory. This place totally hit the spot.. 930 am SAT morning. um yah, a  short wait witha group of 5+ a toddler seated in about 10 min ! woot The crepes (hot cakes) are delicious her signature one with the strawberries is the bomb. also, eggs, crispy bacon toast not bad either. Came here for breakfast while visiting family in the area and really enjoyed the meal. Only draw back is parking sucks the lot is ridiculous and street parking is hard because of the traffic. Also cash only.. sort of annoying.. but would totally go back and recommend to all ."
"3.0","Stopped in for a slice. Didn't expect it to take a half hour. Kinda weird that their kitchen isn't at all visible. Usually pizza places with slices for sale have their slices displayed right up front and are quickly available.  This was 8pm on a Saturday and it wasn't busy. Got the pizza finally and it was decent, but I wouldn't go back."
"5.0","Great seafood. Friendly bartenders. My gf and I ordered oysters and sushi and it was all fresh and tasty. I will recommend this place to any seafood lovers."
"5.0","An excellent, clean, new alternative to the hum drum choices.  This chicken was juicy and delicious.  The service was excellent and my meal was ready within 1 minute after I ordered it and got my drink.  Make no mistake--their 'Damn Hot' is for real.  I love hot and spicy food, and this was flaming hot.  I recommend 'Hot' if you aren't sure.  I got the tenders and will try the sandwich next time.  Fries were good.  I will definitely go back."
"5.0","George is great. What a great place!  Food is delicious and service is wonderful! We will definitely come back! Ribeye was delicious. Pretzel bites were great too!"
"5.0","Great place!  Workers were nice and food was unique and delicious!  Coffee was described as 'bright' and kind of acidic.  My latte was good.  I also ordered a custard-type Dessert to go which was ah-mazing."
"4.0","Very expensive, but amazing food! Very busy in the bar area while waiting for our table, not a lot of places to stand, feels like you're in the way of servers if all the seats are taken. I'd definitely eat here again."
"4.0","Prince of India offered a pretty stellar Groupon deal. I took the plunge and am glad I did. The first time I went, I had the buffet. The only vegan options in the buffet were chana masala and dal. While not abysmal, the meal was decidedly forgettable, and I was frustrated to discover my discount was not applicable to the buffet as it meant a return trip would be necessitated.As it turned out, the second time was definitely the charm. My girlfriend and I were thoroughly impressed by our (modified non-dairy version of) the mouth-watering veg thali with its aromatic fresh vegetables, savory legumes, flaky samosa, and crisp but tender roti. The meal left us with satisfied bellies, and when the chef emerged from the kitchen, we couldn't help but give him two big thumbs up. Wowza! This is one 'prince' that ought to be king - of the Pittsburgh culinary scene, at least!"
"1.0","The Szechuan Chicken was pretty mediocre. Egg roll was like eating a wet rag and I've made better rice from Uncle Ben'S.If you want decent service w slop for food this is your place."
"5.0","Great food.. Excellent Biryani, chicken tikka and Naan & chicken 65.  Good customer service."
"2.0","Way too salty it was inedible for me because of the salt."
"4.0","Would rate 5 stars, but it's cash-only and the wait for breakfast can take FOREVER. Giant portions worth your money, and the food is amazing. If you're craving a good breakfast diner, this is the place to go! Fun atmosphere & great service."
"3.0","Smoked meats are the star here. For the entrees the chefs try to get too creative without a grasp for the ingredients. Dishes lack proper technique, risotto undercooked, peaches weren't caramelized, shrimp over cooked, the lemon tart is over cooked on the custard and undercooked on the pastry. Very disappointing overall, would go again only for charcuterie and drinks but nothing more"
"2.0","When asked to meet friends before a concert to have dinner I thought I would give it another chance.... should of saved my money.  I love beer battered fish so I ordered their beer battered fish dinner.  The batter was heavy and over loaded, way more batter than fish, very thick, not light like it should be, bake potato was hard not baked long enough or maybe they nuke it vs baking it, mixed veggies where right out of the freezer bag steamed. Long John Silvers does fish better.... The server was ok not great ... kept calling everyone 'honey' someone should be teaching them that is in very poor taste."
"5.0","Had a Schrader one day and been back a few times. Friendly small diner atmosphere. And fast the food is good and a good price! Daily specials!"
"1.0","What is going on here? Worst dining experience I've had in awhile. Where to begin? Daughter's birthday. She wanted crab legs. I looked through Yelp for the best in the 'Burg-when I came across Luke Wholey's & I immediately booked reservations for dinner. Hubby & I have been here so many times & loved it-We arrived on time-7:30 last Thursday night. Stood in the doorway for almost 15 minutes and NO ONE ever greeted us or acknowledged us at all. No one was hosting at the door. Finally brought to a table that needed to be cleaned off. Table was finally cleaned. We wait about 20 minutes for a waiter to come to our table. Drinks took about 25/30 minutes to get to the table. Meantime, we ordered she crab soup and lobster bisque. Took forever-It probably sat under the heat lamps 15-20 minutes, because when a food runner brought it to our table it had that skin on it that forms when it has sat under those warming lights too long. A soup that we had really wanted to be delicious was inedible. It was thick and lumpy, not hot & just gross. My swordfish was over cooked and also inedible. The glass of wine I ordered never came. The mashed potatoes with our entrees were cold. I took two bites of my entree, and although I did not complain, the waiter saw that I didn't eat my meal and offered to take half off the bill immediately...Like it happens all the time. I don't want half priced entrees for food I didn't eat-How about we just wanted good food & good service at a place we have been to many, many times. Not slow, spotty, aggravating, almost-absent service, subpar food, inedible-! What a lovely birthday celebration for my daughter. Everybody was tense, not having the good time we had hoped for. Very disappointed. I don't know what's going on here but it's not good. Really sorry to see this happen. This is not the Luke Wholey's we have enjoyed. The place I just experienced is certain not to be in business long, and that makes me sad. Too bad."
"3.0","This place is pretty solid all in all. I wish they had pineapple as a topping option though. I never understand why places don't have pineapple because you can store a can pretty easily before you need to place it on a pizza. Anyways, the dom is pretty huge and way affordable. we've ordered from them a million times. If you pick up you save a buck or two on your pizza. I always recommend them. Sometimes they are slammed and delivery could take an hour or a bit more, so ask if they don't mention a wait time."
"5.0","Amazing food!! We go here often and have never been disappointed with a dish. They change up the menu depending on the season.  The Brussels sprouts app is very tasty. We always order this. By far, my favorite meal here is the diner burger.  It is the best burger I have ever had!"
"3.0","I think their food is hit or miss, for example, their pizza is like a frozen pizza you get at a supermarket - it's awful. Their fries are very good though"
"5.0","A little slow service wise, place needs to be remodeled but food is heavenly and Salem and the rest of the staff are friendly.  Stop in the store for shopping afterwards."
"5.0","Love going here for happy hour & a night out! Happy hour has some good deals, get the pop corn to snack on! Also recommend trying a new drink! They know how to make a different drink than what your used to! They also have fun games to play while drinking!"
"5.0","I ate here this past Friday evening with my girlfriend and her parents.  We had an 8:30 reservation and arrived a few minutes early only to be told that they were 15 minutes behind schedule and that we could wait outside or at the bar next door.  This wasn't the most thrilling option for us as we did not want to go to the bar which meant that we we stuck outside with all of the smokers from the nearby bar which we thoroughly despised.  At first I was pretty peeved by our wait but as the host repeatedly apologized for the delay throughout the night and I realized that they had a 40+ person wedding party upstairs and a 20 top downstairs, it easily became apparent that they were not really to blame.  The restaurant itself is fairly quaint with the tables being made from slate(?) with some inlaid artwork and also some other local artwork for sale on the walls.Having been here before we knew that Sausilido was BYOB and brought in our own bottle for a nominal $2/person corkage fee which the waiter opened while telling us about the daily fish and risotto specials.  Our group decided to start off our evening smoked gouda.  Before it was delivered to the table we received the local bread and bean dip that is served with all of their entrees.  The bread was nice and the bean dip even better which led to be it being finished before our appetizer even made it to the table.  The gouda was served with a crust on the outside and was topped off by some pesto while sitting on a bed of spinach.  It came sans bread which our table thought was odd but may have been due to the fact that we already ate all of ours.  Once we tasted it though, the bread was not missed as it was both savory and delicious which allowed it to be enjoyed by our whole party.  Shortly after our appetizer was finished, the salads that came with all of the entrees were delivered.  They were decent sized and dressed in a tasty vinegarette.  I really enjoyed it, especially the beets which you so rarely get on house salads.   For my entree I had a tough time deciding between the hangar steak and duck breast before ultimately settling on the hangar steak.  Whenever our entrees came out, everyone at the table commented on how large they were.  I was also surprised to see that in addition to the steak, bacon horseradish creme fraiche and warm potato salad that was described on the menu, they had garnished my dish with a sizable portion of roasted cauliflower and red peppers.  All of my dish was excellent with the warm potato salad tasting awesome while the steak was cooked perfectly and the extra vegetables being good as well.  My only complaint would be the large scoop of creme fraiche that seemed ladled onto my steak.  That in itself would not have been too bad except for the fact that the horseradish seemed to be heavy in it and overpowered all of the other flavors.  Thankfully I enjoy horseradish and so did not find it to be too horrible even though it was even a bit much for me on several of the pieces that I had eaten.  With all of the food that we had eaten, we were not able to order dessert and even passed on our planned trip to the nearby froyo store afterward.The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again.  Every time that I come to this place I am reminded of why I constantly have it as one of my top 5 restaurants in the 'burgh."
"5.0","My favorite Thai place in the city. It's a simple place with affordable and delicious food. The portions are big, and the wait staff is attentive. I've only ever gotten their curry dishes but they are always so good!"
"3.0","3.5 So much potential- just kick it up one more notch. Cute place. Way too bright- dim those lights. The service was good, but you could literally hear the server arguing with the kitchen...? The food was ok. The Brussels sprouts were average. The soup was delicious. The salads were swimming in dressing (I couldn't eat it), and where was the kale? It was basically romaine and dressing. The ravioli was yummy, but the sauce was so thin/ runny that it wouldn't  'stick' to the pasta- I wanted a thicker heartier sauce. If they focused in on a few small details, this place could be 5 Star."
"3.0","[Restaurant Week]  The service left me wanting for more. I didn't care for the decor Grand Manner slavery era portraits adorned the walls along with stuffed deer heads. I felt uncomfortable.  My steak had to be refired. Our bread was late to the table. The waiter complained about how many people were going to be coming through the restaurant for lunch.  The whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth. How many Steak resultants does one downtown need?"
"4.0","I have really enjoyed this place. Believe the spice ratings and when the person at the counter tries you to tone it down, don't be a hero. Listen to the warnings. This is a great change up from the other offerings in Oakland. While they have sweet tea, they are missing a brewed unsweetened tea option."
"5.0","Everything about this place is fantastic! The woodwork, the ambience, the food, service and the boardgames!! Oh and the drinks are spot on and in with the times... Also sliding garage when it's warmer. And the music is dope. Highly approve!"
"5.0","Very very tasty! I went for the lunch buffet (only $10!) and was pleasantly surprised by almost all vegetarian options. The daal and okra were particularly tasty, and they had a mango drink that was out-of-this-world delicious. I wish they labeled things as explicitly vegetarian/vegan, because we had to ask about some things. Also, I wish there were a salad bar like at most Indian buffets I've been to- there weren't any vegetables that weren't deep fried. The inside was clean and the staff very attentive- thanks for a great lunch!"
"4.0","The food was very appetizing and filling! I recommend sitting outside so you can enjoy the hanging umbrellas. Mary was our waitress and she was so sweet! Definitely get the brunch special for a good deal!"
"5.0","I went for lunch this monday and had the london broil, grilled flank steak with roasted sweet potatoes over mixed greens.  I wanted to try their signature capon and ditallini soup but they were out.   Their complimentary starter, white bean dip with bits of celery, red peppers, carrots and drizzled with balsamic vinegar is scrumptious.  The steak was the best i've had in a while although a bit too rare; the next time i go i'll bring along a bottle of red to enjoy with it, obviously i will definitely be going back.  I used to live within five minutes of a walk from Sausalido but had never tried the place out :(.  It's a gem in Pittsburgh and probably the best place to eat in Bloomfield.  I also had their turkey havarti sandwich with asparagus and basil mayo...it was pretty much a perfect sandwich definitely worth nine dollars.  It's a small cozy place with the cutest bathroom for women that I have ever been in.  The bathroom had a canvas of marilyn monroe and her quote 'I am not interested in money.  I just want to be wonderful,' on the wall."
"4.0","I have been wanting to try Luke Wholey's for a while and tonight was finally able to do so. We will be back for sure. Super good. It was a slow night (but also a Pens game- so that worked to our benefit) started with the Shrimp Cocktail and Calamari. Large Shrimp that were very good (just not chilled cold) but that's really my only complaint on the whole meal. Shrimp cocktail, to me, should be very cold. These were room temperature. I had the Shrimp Volcano. Mashed potatoes topped with Lobster bisque and shrimp. Very nice. The asparagus was perfect. My husband had the crab topped salmon and said it was delicious.  We shared the flourless chocolate torte and added a scoop of ice cream. Would recommend this place to anyone in the area."
"2.0","Most definitely college quality.  Look for cheap eats, here you go. Had two slices of pizza, pepperoni and mushroom. Not a fan of can mushrooms."
"5.0","Great place! Wonderful breakfast. Not least: Piri Piri hot sauce on the table. Excellent omelettes, one green omelette, one with chorico. Very tasty potatoes with, and bread with sweet butter. The 'exotic' nature of a Portuguese restaurant might make some folks hesitate, but don't let yourself get into a rut here, you won't regret a thing--you could even order the usual 'American' breakfast, but don't do it. Coffee first rate.I was planning to explain to them that they shoud be selling bottles of the Piri Piri hot sauce when I noticed a barrel full of many bottles right beside the counter. So, stocked up on that. Not able to resist showing off I mentioned that we had become fans of Nando's bbq while in Qatar once. The owner dumbfounded us by saying that she would be bringing Nando's bbq chicken here, soon. Can't wait.Can't wait to go back to The Azorean Cafe for lunch now, that menu looks terrific."
"5.0","Great burger selection along with beer selection. The service was prompt and friendly. What I liked most though was the style of burger they are making. It is not your 'meatball' thick burger that seems to be everywhere. It was the right size and truly delicious. I will definitely be going back to try some of their other fun burger creations."
"5.0","Y'all. This place is standout - affordable and delicious food!!Don't be fooled by the hole-in-the-wall cafeteria style interior, the styrofoam takeout boxes/plastic utensils and tucked away location - the food shines even brighter because it's the star of the show. I got a portion of goat curry for $8.99 and ate it for at least 4 solid meals. The guy behind the case suggested spinach as my side, claiming it was the best spinach I'd ever have and WOW, it was certainly tasty!!It's a great place for friends with varied tastes and dietary needs - my vegetarian friend had plenty of options to choose from and her husband who was craving meat had his fill too! The fries are wonderful too. I've also had their catering and everything is just as delicious plus their baklava hits the spot!Bonus, the parking lot is small but always a win in Pittsburgh and the Strip!"
"5.0","Went with a friend on a Friday around lunch time and was seating right away. Ordered the Two Eggs breakfast with bacon and replaced the toast for a blueberry pancake which was definitely worth it. Also ordered the french toast and the strawberry compote that came with it was not overly sweet and also slightly tart which was a good balance. The space was very open and had a lot of light. Liked being able to see the chefs and the prepping/plating of the food."
"3.0","We were here for restaurant week 2018 summer. Disappointed that they ran out of the soft shell crabs which was one of their features for restaurant week. Got the salmon. Thought it was stuffed with crab but there was a very thin layer of crab on top. The Caesar salad was Excellent. The house cab was nice. Also ran out of the blue berry cheesecake. Suggest that you have some alternatives if you run out of items on the restaurant menu."
"5.0","Best Japanese restaurant in Pittsburgh hands down. Sushi is phenomenal and you can tell the chef takes pride in it's preparation. Everybody was very happy with their cooked dishes as well. Recently had a soft shell crab tempura as a special- delicious! And their miso soup is great."
"5.0","This is the best Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh -- great service and they are not afraid to make it hot (Thai Hot), if requested. Many vegetarian options -- the food is fresh -- the flavor is nice -- and, the wait staff is friendly -- I highly recommend this restaurant!"
"3.0","We came in from out of town for a conference and looked on yelp and found this place.  Upon walking in the vibe is nice.  Open and airy and fun feeling.  We had a reservation which was good because they were really busy.  We ordered the lobster bisque and it was delicious.  We ordered oysters and never received them.  We also ordered the half order of the crab combo with lobster and it was good.  The lobster was over cooked, but edible.  Our server wasn't the best by not being on top of drinks and he was slow moving.  Sorry for the 3 star, I would've given it a 4 but since we didn't get the oysters I put a 3"
"5.0","Many reasons for the 5-star rating. First, service was wonderful; prompt, friendly, and accommodating without being overly intruding. We can to the Caffe for brunch and ordered the Brentwood (bagel), Num Num (French toast), and savory crepe (forget name) with pesto, mozzarella, and tomato, which I added egg. Everything came out quickly and was delicious. It's a small, intimate cafe with art on the wall for sale, and if you blink you'll miss it on Penn Ave but definitely worth it!I'm incredibly picky and brunch is my favorite meal so I will definitely be back and recommend"
"4.0","I had a good first experience at Cinderlands. Bartender was very attentive & friendly. I had a pint of their Cream Ale & then a taster of their coffee porter, which is highly recommended-delish! I ordered a burger without fries & they subbed some of their Brussels sprouts for a small up charge, which was fine by me. I just missed happy hour since theirs is early I think 4-6:30. Food was good, nice atmosphere & place was packed by 7pm. I'd definitely stop in again when in Lawrenceville."
"5.0","Every time, i visit this establishment, actually before i visit, i get the excitement of what i would be trying this time.The customer service is absolutely friendly, the chefs are outstanding.A Fusion of Moroccan, Italian and American cuisines, the result is a mouth watering dishes, salads, sandwiches....    You name it!The prices are extremely reasonable and the portions are very generous.I will be  back, with the same excitement for sure ;-) ."
"2.0","Terrible service, terrible food. We never got our appetizer, 1/2 the table didn't get the correct sides. When the food did arrive, it was tasteless. It was a terrible"
"4.0","Yaaaasssss! I'm so glad this opened in town because I NEVER make it to Lawrenceville on the weekend early enough before they sell out. Came In for some lunch. My coworker and I split the ham and Swiss sandwich and the prosciutto and pickles sandwich. Both were great! The little bit of butter on them just makes them so simple but SO good. We also split a croissant and I had this chocolate lava cake (prob not what it was called but it was DELICIOUS). The staff were all very pleasant and nice. My reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is the set of refrigerators that have REALLY heavy slamming doors and are close to some of the seating (where we were seated) every time they were opened,which was a lot because they were restocking, the slamming noise just was so loud. Prob wouldn't even mention it if it wasn't a Bakery/coffee shop that has more of a quaint and quiet feel."
"5.0","Went to redbeards for my lunch break and the bartender was beyond friendly. Really seems like she cares about the customers and is a great add to the staff. Will most certainly be here again if all the staff is like kortney v!!"
"4.0","The crispy chicken sandwich is not their best dish. It was over fried . Otherwise great ambience. I guess I just ordered the wrong item. It would be good for the staff to guide the new customers as to what their signature dishes are."
"4.0","Stopped in for dinner on a Sunday night at 7pm and Alexander's was about half full. We decided to go simple and stick with the Pastabilities. I choose the Bolognese with penne  (~$12) and mushrooms (extra $1.50), while my husband ordered the Marfredo with farfelle ($11), sundried tomatoes and hot sausage (extra $4). Bolognese was solid though lacked mushrooms and my husband's dish was tasty too though the hot sausage was bland, it needed salt. Portions are huge, mine was easily two meals. Italian bread or rolls (not warmed up) w/ butter balls comes with the meal and there is EVOO on the table. For dessert, we ordered the chocolate chip cannolli which came with two - we enjoyed them but it pricey for the size $7. Aside from the dessert, the meal was reasonably priced.Service was consistent with other Yelpers' reviews - really, really friendly. We liked our waitress. Because there were no mushrooms in my dish, she was suppose to take it off our bill but forgot so ended up giving a cash credit. Also I ended up packaging my Bolognese home since I couldn't eat it all and she asked if we wanted the rolls too and wrapped my pasta in saran wrap for the trip home to prevent any sauce spillage which was a smart move since we had walked here.One comment though would be on the decor. You walk in and the bar area somewhat has a modern feel but then once you go into the dining room it is like you are warped back into time. There is just a lot of visual stimulation - over the top - that just doesn't go together.Overall though, Alexander's just gets it done - nothing fancy w/ home style food and  great prices and service. We'll be skipping other Italian places in the area and will be back again."
"4.0","i enjoyed the freshness of the fish but I did notice a lack of specialty rolls there. The fried chicken appetizer was pretty amazing, much better than chaya's imo."
"3.0","It was a rainy Friday night and while our umbrella kept us (mostly) dry, we used the excuse of 'getting out of the rain for a bit' to stop at a couple of spots between where we were and our hotel. Redbeards was one of them. The staff was definitely friendly, and it wasn't crazy busy, but just busy enough that they were mostly occupied. Their drinks were just fine, and overall this place is A-OK!"
"1.0","I don't even wanna give them one star. I order from them regularly and while never am really impressed, I order again. but after tonight, never again.... After placing a $38 dollar order for a large broc chicken Alfredo pizza, there was barely any broc, almost no chicken, and no sauce what soever... One of the worst pizzas I've ever had. The side salad we ordered with cheese, had no cheese... Two unripe tomatoes and looked like it was sitting out all day.  Finally,,, I called to complain... The rude ass guy on the phone interrupted me mid sentence and said hold on, I'm getting the manager. After ten minutes, he gets back on, says' I can't find him' and HANGS UP on me!!!!!Wtf?!!!!!! NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!"
"1.0","So I haven't posted a review in awhile...usually just do if I love it or don't like it.  This would fall into the don't like.  Tried a couple different crepes.  Really unimpressive.  The 'Holy Crepe' was super sweet and just fair and the savory crepe was not tasty.  Coffee was fine, nothing special, and service was very disinterested.  Maybe I'll try it again but not sure I'd go back..."
"5.0","My boyfriend and I decided to stop at burghers for pittsburgh restaurant week to take advantage of their special deal, and I am so glad we did. Service was great, we were greeted and seated immediately (we also had a reservation.) The server brought us a bottle of water for the table, which I LOVE because I am always guzzling down my water.Food came out quick, I had the fox chapel burger with #theblend patty (50 percent beef 50 percent mushroom) and it was delicious! Fries were good and we had a large helping.This might be the best burger I've had in Pittsburgh so far living here, keep it up burghers!"
"3.0","There was lots of hype about this place so I was excited to try it out. I have had the well known  Hattie B's Nashville hot chicken and was hoping it was going to be something comparable. CHiKN has multiple levels of spice I had the hot it was spicy but not too spicy if I would go back I would try the damn hot. The restaurant was packed but there was confusion everywhere. Some of the tables were not clean and the fountain drinks all tasted terrible. My group all paid  the fountain drinks but couldn't drink them because they tasted so bad. We ended up drinking water. The wait time for the food was long we ate inside. When the food did arrive it was good the fries were  hot not soggy. The chicken had a nice spice to it and was still hot so that was a plus but the Mac and cheese was cold and all stuck together had the potential to be good. I would give it another try maybe they have to work out some kinks but there needs to be less confusion with staff and a cleaner environment. I understand it's Oakland but for a newer restaurant they need to step their game up. Things to know: They do not accept cash - cards only Music is loud & not censored - for me not an issue I enjoyed the music but some might care. They serve alcohol"
"5.0","The real French breeze in the Lawrenceville area. I can't speak highly enough for this place.The taste, atmosphere, vibe, owners, and much more just under one roof! It's a must try for any locals and visitors!"
"4.0","Overall the place was cheap, good tasting, and has good service. The healthyness of the food is pretty questionable, but hey I'm here for a good time not a long time. I had the chicken shawarma and it's big enough to share for 2"
"3.0","My first impression upon walking in was that the restaurant was not very well organized.  They may have had employees call off, which happens, but there were only two people manning several tables and so I had to wait ten minutes to be seated.The service was good, my bread, soup and appetizers came in a decent amount of time and all the food was very delicious and very well made.  All fresh ingredients, quality foods, nothing frozen.  My entree took a while to come, longer than it should have but I was still kept well informed by the young lady waiting on me.  I had the Bucicini which was a type of tube spaghetti tossed with olive oil and butter, garlic, bay scallops, tiger shrimp, mussels, shaved parmesan and arugula.  Truly delicious, outstanding combination of flavors and again, all fresh ingredients.  The only problem I had with the food was the price.  I thought $26 for this plate of food was a little overpriced.  I've had pasta plates in the middle of San Diego with twice as much meat for less than $20.  Final word: the food is excellent, but they're trying to emulate a five star restuarant when they shouldn't be.  They are located in a quaint part of town where their prices are too high for the area.  The price range for Yelp falls under 'Moderate', I thought it was more expensive than Moderate."
"5.0","I think at one point I was eating breakfast and lunch at Craftwork two to three times a week.  Not the easiest thing for my wallet ... but my belly sure enjoyed all the amazing food.  This particular offering is located in the basement of the US Steel Tower along with Istanbul Grille, a pizza place, and Au Bon Poo.  Aside from the days where I venture out of the Tower, Craftwork is pretty much my default lunch option.  Two mains reasons:  first the people, they're all awesome.  And second, the value.  You get GREAT food and it is in line with all the other offerings in that category around the area.  My favorite has to be the Pinkman.  A chicken wrap with cheese, barbecue sauce, and bacon.ps:  quite possibly the best fries in town."
"1.0","Terrible service, refused to apologize for late delivery, rude/dismissive when when questioned on order status. Decent pizza, but will not order again."
"4.0","Pleasantly surprised! Great food and service. My only complaint is the same as other people have said, the wonton soup. The broth is good however, the wonton's are not stuffed with anything so it's basically broth with wonton skins. Everything else was great! Highly recommend if you are in the area."
"5.0","We had an excellent celebratory lunch arranged on a Saturday afternoon. The Sausalido team was very easy to work with over email and phone. The setting was European and family style which we enjoyed and allowed for spirited conversation in true Serbian fashion. The prices were very reasonable for outstanding dishes. Everyone was impressed by the service and quality of food. My family members and friends really felt at home. Also it was no problem to bring our own desserts (as is custom in Serbia) and our own wine and beer with a minimum corking fee. Thank you for a lovely experience!"
"5.0","Service has been aces every visit. Pom mimosa's with veggie sushi is every vegans dream."
"5.0","Restaurant Week really is the best deal of the year. Where else can you experience fine dining for 35 bucks? My husband and I both loved our experience at Capital Grille. We went for Restaurant Week but we really splurged with the upgrades. For my 3 courses, I chose the wedge salad, filet mignon, and espresso cake. I also added a lobster tail for 10 bucks. Everything was amazing!  My filet melted in my mouth like butter and the lobster tail was excellent. My husband upgraded to the Kona crusted NY Strip and omg it was incredible!!! We paid $45 for soup, the steak, and dessert... and the steak is regularly $47 on the regular menu! He also added the crab Oscar and it was a huge portion for $10! He got the cheesecake dessert and it was excellent as well. Excellence all around! Our server, Rebecca was fantastic and treated us wonderfully. Obviously, I highly recommend Capital Grille and will certainly be back!"
"4.0","Visited for the second time for drinks with another couple. Everything was basically the same as our previous visit, a cool environment up here and it isn't a rowdy bar that people get crazy at. The noise level is above average but you can still have decent conversation at your table and not have to yell. I have to comment about a couple of the drinks we had. One of us had the Frozen Merry Berry, and just like the Frozen Rose I had during the summer, it was surprisingly strong! I had the Rusty Rail Fools Gold beer, a peanut butter hefeweizen. Yuck! I am a huge peanut butter lover but this beer was sooo bad lol. We all tried a sip, and that was all that was missing from my glass when we left. I recommend they get rid of that immediately! Why do I always have to try something new?!"
"5.0","My husband and I went here for lunch based on the recommendation of the guy manning the parking lot (and the guy that was pulling in to park) and it was the best recommendation we've ever received. I got the 'Ultra' Cheesesteak and my husband tackled The Roethlisburger. We also ordered a large order of cheese fries. The fries seem hand it and the cheese to dip them in is the perfect mix of salty and cheesy. The real standouts, however, were the sandwiches. First of all, they are HUGE. They come with lettuce, tomato and mayo. My hubby and I are firm believers in not messing with the way people suggest you eat things so we got our sandwiches with everything they recommended. The meats on both sandwiches were so tender and flavorful. The cheesesteak was the best sandwich I've ever had. My husband loved the '#7' so much that he ate until he was over-full. It was a tiny bit spicy and so very good. Don't miss Peppi's. It is perfection"
"5.0","Best authentic Japanese restaurant for miles. I've been coming here with my family since I was little. Sushi is always fresh (with excellent sushi rice) and entrees are super delicious. They upgraded on their house salad with ginger dressing which is my favorite Japanese house salad ever. They make their own soy sauce in house. They added to their dessert menu but I rarely get that far since I usually get stuffed on their amazing food. Their sushi is just as good as sushi at Japanese restaurants in coast cities. They aren't fancy with their rolls with over 10 ingredients, like other places. They're pretty simple, but that's what makes their sushi so good. You can taste the freshness of the fish. Highly recommend!"
"5.0","Great food and service with a large menu and fresh food. Homemade feel, nice pictures. The guy offered me a bottle of water for free. Very nice."
"3.0","With India Garden closed for health violations, and few other choices around town, I've been pleased with our experience at Tamarind. It's definitely better than average.Everything I've had is tasty. Nothing is too greasy or overcooked. The sauces taste like they should. And, if you BYOB, the cost of a meal is extremely reasonable."
"4.0","Wish I could give a 3.5. Service: We waited a good bit before our server coming over to greet us and take drink orders. Once our server did arrive the service was attentive. Atmosphere/Decor: Fun and funky vibe. A bit loud, def not the place for an intimate dinner. Loved the murals and the decor. Food/Drink: I love hot tea and was pleasantly surprised by the tea selection. There was a speciality beverage menu but we didn't partake. There are two dinner menus; one sushi and one house. We started with the lobster bisque fries.  They were great. The bisque was well balanced, the fries fresh and large chunks of lobster. I had the seafood trio which disappointed. The fish was overcooked as was the lobster.  Instead of bok choy I received kale. My husband had the land and sea, again dissappointed. His scallop was under cooked. The steak was cooked perfectly. My son had the crab legs. The sectioning though convenient made them become cold very quickly. The mashed potatoes were a hard rock while the asparagus was perfectly grilled. For dessert we split the flourless chocolate cake which was perfect. It was rich and dense but melted quickly."
"1.0","I never ate here before just drank after work in the old days. So I was in the mood for a pastrami sandwich,  this place is 2 blocks from my work so I went in. The grown up version of bam-bam behind the bar says you can't order food at the bar, go to the back and order. I order a 'hot' pastrami and swiss on rye, lady asks want anything else on it, I ask do you have brown mustard? She says smartly 'it's the only mustard use '. Ask for a ice tea then pay. Guy says ' it will be a minute while it heats up'. I get my sandwich.  Meat was 'cold' & dry, cheese not melted. For the $$ the portion was small. The bread was fresh and the pickle was good. Total waste of 10 bucks.  The only good thing from the experience was the cute girl with the tattoos that works there. They claim to be New York style, bullshit. Don't waste your money."
"5.0","Excellent, amazing, wonderful and any other adjective you can use to describe greatness.. been there tons of times and it's always the same. Great tacos!! The chef is talkative, the atmosphere is upbeat and best tacos in Pittsburgh.. thank you Doce Tagueria!!"
"5.0","This is the cutest cosiest tea shop! They have a great variety of drinks. I got a basil lavender lemonade, the 'lavenade' and it was so good! They also serve a nice selection of salads, sandwiches, and baked goods. I had the happy turkey club and it was delicious! This is a must-do in Pittsburgh!"
"1.0","This subway is apparently 'private' so they don't follow national promotions like the 'buy one get one free foot long if you buy a drink' or accept any coupon that I bring from the mail or from a coupon book. You'll be better off going to the one on Forbes. literally every time I've gone here with a coupon I've had to pay full price."
"4.0","I chose Luke Wholeys for my birthday dinner since I had never been and have heard great things about their lobster rolls and bloody Mary's. The atmosphere was pretty loud, although theydid have three large parties there at the same time we were there. It was very hard to hear each other with everyone talking. I ordered the Bloody Mary with shrimp and candied bacon which was very good, just the right amount of spice and the sky vodka was good. For dinner, I ordered the lobster bisque which amazing and the Baja shrimp which was also delightful. I decided to get the lobster roll, which honestly was my own fault because it came on a nice roll, which I didn't eat because I'm trying to watch with the holidays coming. I chose to dig the lobster out of the bun and eat the meat, which also I didn't realize was going to be cold like a seafood salad. I think I was expecting more of a warm, buttery lobster rather than a cold seafood salad. My fianc√© had the swordfish which was very good.  Overall, everything was good, I just wouldn't order that again if We do go back."
"5.0","This place is amazing! The fries are probably the best I've had in Pittsburgh so far. They also take a lot of care with every order and make sure the customer gets exactly what they want! This is my first positive Yelp review so I obviously really enjoyed my first couple visits here"
"3.0","I would definitely say a 3.5 stars. The food was 5++++, the service was a 0. I got the Morning After Breakfast special with specialty hot cakes and a side of the potatoes, and it was so good. I didn't believe in the hype much, but after going, I can also solidly say that this place has one of the best diner breakfast foods. The eggs were delicious, the bacon perfect, and the banana chocolate chip hotcakes were heavenly. I'm more of a savory breakfast person, but I could NOT stop eating those hotcakes! However, the winner was definitely the potatoes. If you go, get the potatoes. They were amazing! My friend got the chorizo hash and oh my goodness, that is definitely what I'm getting the next time I get back! With a side of hotcakes of course! There is definitely a lot of food. We all had something to take home. Granted, you can see the grease on the plate, but that's what makes it SO good. However, the service was one of the poorest I have ever received. Our waitress came over to get our order- no hi, no greeting, just 'what do you want'.  Then, we never saw her again. We ordered, and she wasn't part of the group bringing our food over. It wasn't a busy day. There were  empty tables, and she spent all of her time just hanging in the back. We were all out of water. No refills. No check up half way to see if the food was good, if we needed anything. Finally, at the end, I tried to make eye contact with her to see if I could get more water and if we could get to go boxes. We actually made eye contact. And held it. She just looked bored and annoyed and just kept staring with her hands crossed. Eventually, I got up and WENT TO HER. Asked her if we could have a to-go container. She asked how many, and just gave us the boxes. I smiled, thanked her, and told her to have a nice day. No response. Same blank stare. Eventually, we packed our three boxes and realized we didn't get a bag. My friend went and asked this time. We eventually realized there was just 1 bag. For 3 of us. At this point we just gave up. We all left a decent tip because I'm assuming they split their tips since other people brought our food over. Had it not been for that, I would have happily tipped much less if any at all. Having a waitress who is busy and can't get to you is one thing. Having one that purposefully lets you know she's ignoring is another. We all left RAVING about the food, but just disappointed at the experience."
"5.0","I was really skeptical about coming here because my boyfriend and I tend not to have the same taste.  The place seems too simple - limited meal options, alcohol.  But the food was fantastic.  I had the Fried Chicken Sandwich and it did not disappoint.  I genuinely enjoyed every bite.  It was incredibly flavor filled and just felt...perfect.We went around 7 on a Tuesday and were seated right away. Waiter was friendly and gave us all the information I needed when I said it was my first time stopping in."
"4.0","The omelette is a little bit salty. Overall good. But the service is not as expected. They can get really busy at lunch time, so if you want to go there, go early in case of a huge queue."
"4.0","I tried this place while I was staying in Pittsburgh, where restaurant options were slim.  Chinatown Inn was much better than I expected; I loved the sesame noodles and hot and sour soup.Interesting point about this place, it's close to either a precinct or something as quite a few customers were cops and there were several squad cars on the street.  I felt much safer in the neighborhood after I picked up my dinner to go."
"5.0","Just had brunch there while in town and could not have asked for a better place! Good service, the menu was simple and straightforward and the food was delicious. I super recommend the peanut butter and banana waffle, which was amazing!"
"5.0","Cinderlands is a welcomed gem in the Lawerenceville neighborhood. They have it all, great craft beer (brewed in-house), delicious food, local PA spirits and televisions! Usually around the burgh you have to choose between a place with a tv and mediocre food/beer or a place with good beer/food and no TVs. Not here!The staff is incredibly friendly and enjoys talking about both the beer and food menus. They must all be very involved in the process because both bartenders I have been served by knew a lot about the beer and food. More than just the normal memorization of the listings. Drink must haves: the Coffee flavored IPA, the regular IPA, seasonal cocktail (can't remember the name but it was made with a local rye whiskey and our friend who is not a big drinker loved it so much he ordered another)Food must haves: Chicken sandwich. The homemade pickles are soooo good! Brisket sandwich was out of this world! I will update this post as I try new items but so far I am thoroughly impressed."
"4.0","Surprised that I never wrote a review for this place so I came again this morning to try it once more. As such, this joint has moved from their old location a little down the block but still on the same street. As soon as I entered, I could notice what an improvement the new place is easily over the old place ... wow. I chose to order the Blueberry Ricotta Pancakes along with two eggs sunny-side up and a sausage. For those of you who don't know, you order at the counter and they'll give you a number plaque and bring your order right to you when it's ready. Bit into the pancakes and it brought back memories of when I had it the first time ... really, just as good as they've ever been. Freshly made, the maple syrup was a wonderful addition, and I could really appreciate the thought of using real fruit (blueberries). Quite yummy indeed. Eggs were also well done. I will ding them on the sausage though as I thought it was a little too hard for my liking ... probably overcooked so if anything, I would suggest taking the sausage out just a little earlier to preserve what would otherwise be a much softer but more delicious sausage. Overall, great place to come for breakfast, brunch, and lunch ... if you haven't been here yet, you should definitely give this place a try for sure!"
"5.0","Very nice place. Decor is beautiful and they have a loft with a large table where you can play games with your friends. Staff was very nice!!! We only stopped in for drinks after dinner somewhere else. Husband loved the beer! I had a cider that wasn't made in house. People next to us at the bar ordered food and it looked excellent. They commented on how good it was. Menu looked very interesting and I will be back to try it.  I'm super excited to try the brunch because it sounds soooo good! Great addition to Lawrenceville!"
"4.0","Nice sushi bar. Good food and good ambience. Friendly people. Reasonable price. Make sure you call in for reservation. We were there on. Saturday without reservation so got a seat at the sushi bar which was not bad at all."
"4.0","We kept it simple: hotcakes, eggs, and sausage. Everything was cooked properly and was tasty in its simplicity. I'm not a big pancake fan, but these hotcakes were really good. The edges had a caramelized crisp, and the rest of the cake was thin and not overly cakey. It was a really good breakfast."
"1.0","The food is here OK, nothing spectacular that would WOW you, basically just good bar food. The customer service is TERRBILE. I ordered a fish sandwich, which was supposed to come with cheese but it DID NOT. Most of the ingredients that the sandwich was suppose to come with where left off, and when I questioned the waitress she replied 'I have no idea what's suppose to come on it'. I had a horrible experience here and wont go back."
"3.0","This restaurant has decent Thai food. When I was there, I could smell the laundromat next door. Laundry detergent and Thai food smells do not go well together.  My husband works near this restaurant and goes there all the time. He loves it. maybe I just have a sensitive nose."
"1.0","Horrible first experience tonight with my daughter!  We ordered a make your own pizza and walked up the street to pick it kral other customers came and left with their orders when finally I got up to ask where ours was.  He grabbed a box off the rack and said 'oh, sorry.  Didn't know you were here'. No apology for the wait or the screw up  or any offer of a discount or dessert.As an added bonus to this sad experience 2 other employees showed up from somewhere and started working.  They couldn't have looked less interested and one of the girls was wearing her 'uniform' black tshirt hiked up over her bare belly tightly knotted on the side.  Not only did we have to look at that, but when she leaned over to select toppings, her stomach laid on the pizza!Sorry...can't make this stuff up.  Will NEVER return!"
"5.0","I would give Salem's 15 stars if Yelp let me. When my wife and I lived in Pittsurgh a few years ago, my wife lived next to Salem's Oakland location, and it was amazing. Everyone was extremely friendly and the meat from their butcher counter was excellent and fresh. We literally saw them bringing in the day's selection. So when we moved back to Pittsburgh and heard that they opened a new location in the Strip, we had to check it out. The Strip location is amazing. I can't speak for the grocery side, but the schwarma, grape leaves, baba ghanoush and curries we've gotten from there have been spectacular. Everything is fresh, hot, and declious. They also give you every dollar's worth of food, along with fresh pita and pita chips. Do yourself a favor and go eat at Salem's. Get a schwarma, a cup of their brewed iced tea, and enjoy. It's totally worth the trip to the Strip, and I definitely plan to be back."
"3.0","Forget corporately-owned/sold-out/portion-controlled Primanti Bros. - Peppi's is more of the deal deal for PGH sandwich-y / greasy / drunk-y food ...The cheese-steak is decent ... Fries are pretty good ...  Word on the street is the North side / Western Avenue location makes the best sandwiches for whatever reason..."
"5.0","I had a great ladies night at Luke Wholey's. And we got to meet Mr. Wholey himself! He was very friendly and outgoing, and he gave us free dessert. The food is really good there. The Lobster Bisque Fries are amazing!!!!!!! I'm looking forward to another ladies night out at Luke Wholeys!"
"1.0","Late at night and hungry, I discovered the Cambodian place down the street is a cash-only business. I chose this place because it was the only restaurant on the block with an open kitchen (many kitchens close at 10PM). Desperate times called for desperate measures, and I really should have taken the time to research a better restaurant.I ordered a seafood deluxe pasta dinner and chicken noodle soup. I was told it would take 10 minutes but it really took 30 minutes. I had planned on eating inside, but since it took so long, I asked for the meal to-go instead. By the time I got my food, I was pretty exasperated. The knot tying the bag was too tight, so I was unable to check the food; this meant I left without ensuring a fork was inside.The food was very bad. I have no other way to put it. The pasta was completely tasteless. I know there was imitation crab in the pasta dish, but I can't decipher what else there was; I ate less than 10 bites. The soup was terrible, and I only had a few sips. The broth looked like Campbell's chicken noodle soup (except it looked like the same noodle as the pasta), but tasted saltier. The salad looked quite plain (seen better salads in an airport), but without a fork, I was unable to eat. The soup, salad, and pasta (with tip and tax) cost about $16, so I expect a decent meal at this price.I realize this is a pizza place and I should have ordered pizza, but I didn't want pizza. I also think if you're going to have a full menu, you should be able to properly present what's on the menu. I would've been better off ordering pasta from Pizza Hut. Attempting to eat pasta with a spoon didn't help either. Next time you're in the area, just skip this place."
"5.0","Really liked it. Had amazing food that some other steakhouses did not. A little small but not crowded. Cannot wait to go back!"
"5.0","Went to the capital Grille last night. Service there is really good and food is also excellent. ordered the medium well steak which is delicious."
"5.0","My boyfriend and I came here on a whim, and it ended up being an awesome experience. I ordered the The V bagel, and since I'm a vegan, I asked for no cheese and if they could do something instead of the egg on the side. They gave me an assortment of delicious fruit (a plum, sliced pear, sliced nectarine, grapes, sliced banana and strawberries). My boyfriend got the Portobello crepe and absolutely loved it. As we were leaving, they offered to give us our coffee refill in a to-go cup so we could head out. It's reasonably priced and the service is good.I'll definitely be back!"
"4.0","Great subs/great stories. I love this place and one of my go too places when I am starving and feel like eating a great sub. Lots of options. I classify Peppi's and Primanti's both in my old world Pittsburgh food places. Places I love to reminisce and places I'd love to always return. It may be blue collar but don't let that deter you (if you are that kind to be easily dissuade). Remember Pittsburgh's roots!"
"5.0","We visited Tamarind last night.. Initially we were skeptic with the experience we had with other Indian hotel the previous night ... But I should admit This is one of the best restaurants that have the authentic Indian taste .. The place is clean .. The waiters were respectful , handled every customers very politely..even those who showed after kitchen close were handled politely and given proper explanation ... ( a elderly couple were taken in though they came very late )  excellent   food for a very low price .. These guys are really awesome ... Will recommend this place for everyone who visits Pittsburgh..."
"4.0","This little cafe is perfect for a quick brunch! We ordered the berries toast with vanilla cream, the apple & brie crepe, a caprese bagel sandwich and chai lattes. I would not order the french toast again, just because it was a little too sweet for me. The chai lattes were served in a little mason jars, and they were good but could have been hotter. Everything else was delicious, especially the bagel sandwich. The staff was very kind and the food came out quickly. I will definitely go back to try more food from their extensive menu!"
"3.0","Let me start off by saying I like this place for its vibe and casual atmosphere, not to mention the Bloody Mary's which I feel are among the best in town. The food is nicely presented. This visit I had the breakfast special, your choice of blackened ahi tuna, blackened swordfish, or steak, two eggs cooked to your liking, and home fries and toast. I went with the swordfish with eggs over easy. I happen to understand how to properly blacken fish. One key is for the filet to be thick enough so that when it's seared in a red hot cast iron skillet it doesn't over cook, is moist and not dried out. They missed the mark with a thin fillet that was over cooked and so somewhat dry. The home fries were good though, and the eggs were properly over easy. There was no options for the type of toast though. - just toasted Italian bread. Others in my family had the longest lobster roll, which my son and wife said was sub par. She knows her lobster rolls!My 2 daughters had the crab cake sandwich and loved it. It's not that I won't go back here, but might limit my order to the Bloody Mary!"
"5.0","Great option for outdoor wedding party/reception! We booked Edgar's to cater for our marriage celebration at Riverview Park. We can not be happier with the reservation process, service, and food! Edgar sent three people to whip up hundreds of made to order tacos in a couple hours. We also had beans, rice, chips and salsa. We had a variety of diet preferences and requirements and everyone was able to get their fill without issue. We received a flood of compliments on the food and atmosphere, but really Edgar's deserves our highest recommendation and gratitude for providing such great food paired with fun and professional service."
"1.0","Yesterday, I went to Cafe Raymond in the Strip District with my friend. We each ordered a scone and a cup of coffee and we're told that we were not permitted to sit down in the restaurant or at the tables outside, because we weren't ordering off the menu. We chose to walk out and not buy anything. I called today to complain and she told me that that's been their policy for two years. I've been going to this restaurant for over 2 years, ordering the same thing, yet never being told that we weren't permitted to sit down. I have never been treated this way, regardless of what I have spent. Needless to say I will never visit this establishment again! They should be ashamed of themselves!"
"5.0","I would 100% go back! Everything was great! Love the atmosphere and food was amazing."
"5.0","Go in late night, tell them you already ordered and they will sling you a pizza on the spot.  These guys are solid, it's a shame nobody tips them more than their spare change.  Don't recommend while sober, but take it home late night with some ranch and hot sauce."
"2.0","I was extremely disappointed w/ my experience at Alexander's last evening.  I had visited this restaurant in the past and remember it being much better?  Also, I can't believe this is all Bloomfield has to offer, being the 'Italian' district of Pittsburgh - are you kidding?  First of all, house Chianti tasted like vinegar.  Pasta dishes were an average of $15 and didn't even come w/ a house salad.  They did come w/ soup? however, we were not offered any and forgot about it until this morning.  All of the pasta dishes my party ordered as well as the  entr√©e salads were mediocre (chicken looked like it was processed?) and didn't have many of the ingredients that were outlined on the menu.  And, to top the night off, I got sick off of mine and was up all night w/ indigestion.  UGH!!  I was looking forward to a low-key family dinner and something good to start off the holiday weekend and this restaurant came up short."
"3.0","The staff was polite for the most part. We were told to sit outside where there were a lot of people, so we picked inside where there was one couple and a single. Not sure why this place was labeled vegan because even the salad requires removing lots of ingredients. My husband got the berry French toast and asked for no chocolate. They still added it. Was concerned when tap water was used for my coffee and the server dropped bottled water on the table. Hoping to not get sick from just drinking coffee."
"5.0","So happy to see this place open! Order the baccalhau! Oh yea,  is great here. Excited to come back. I hear they serve dinner of Friday's. A great neighborhood addition to Liberty Avenue."
"4.0","Came here on a Saturday evening before the dinner rush. Didn't have reservations as they were fully booked but was able to get a seat at the bar after waiting for less than 5 minutes. This is a fairly small place and reservations fill up fast so I would recommend to either come before or after dinner rush or make reservations well in advance. Ordered the chicken meatball which was a special and the takoyaki for appetizers. The chicken meatball had a good flavor but I thought it was over cooked. Would prefer it to taste more fresh. The takoyaki was very interesting. I really enjoyed this dish and would definitely order it again. For main course I took the tonkotsu ramen. The noodles were really good and the pork ribs generous but I though the ramen lacked flavor. The soup itself tasted pretty bland. The pork ribs were also over cooked and were on the dry side. The egg that came with it was delicious and perfectly cooked. Overall, I would come again but probably get different dishes to try. I was disappointed in their ramen as I was expecting this dish to have more flavor. Also, had asked for some chili sauce as the ramen lacked flavor and the pork ribs were dry and was charged $1 for this. I think that I shouldn't be charged for chili sauce at a restaurant especially when their dishes lack flavor."
"2.0","Don't order the mussels. Undercooked and some just didn't taste right. However, service was good and prompt. I ordered the salmon, it was interesting. Probably won't be returning."
"5.0","Such a great date night!Once we arrived our jackets were taken and we were quickly taken to our reserved booth. (Thanks to the FREE Open Table Android App) Our server Melissa S was great! We told her that we were celebrating a late Valentine's Day and she brought us each a complimentary Champagne Toast. We both had the Adults Only Arnold Palmer as our cocktails. The bread basket featured some really tasty bread to hold us over until our salads came out. We shared a delicious blue cheese and bacon wedge salad. The Applewood smoked bacon really made the salad. I just wish it had a little more blue cheese in the dressing. The wife had the Dry Aged Steak au Poivre (Tender sirloin flavored with black peppercorn) with a side of creamed spinach and I had the Dry Aged Porterhouse with a side Lobster Mac & Cheese. They were both superb! My Porterhouse was cooked perfectly and was extremely tender and juicy. The mac & cheese was delicious and had a good bit of Lobster as well. We both shared the mac & cheese and creamed spinach. The creamed spinach is blended with a b√©chamel sauce which is good but, a little too salty for my taste.  For dessert we had the Chocolate Hazelnut Cake. So good.The place was pretty packed our entire evening there but, our service never suffered. Our glasses were always full and when finished our plates were also whisked away quickly and without any fuss. Even the valet guys are nice. I'm having my yummy leftovers for lunch as we speak. I couldn't have asked for a better evening!"
"5.0","Loved the food! Ordered the miso soup followed by the Sushi & Sashimi -- both absolutely delicious. Hands down the best miso soup I've had. I'm not usually a fan of raw fish, but I don't regret my decision. The sushi & sashimi was amazing. The service was also phenomenal. Everyone was super attentive and the food came out very quickly. Overall, an amazing experience. Thank you!"
"4.0","I do enjoy the French fries they are hot and made fresh while you wait. Craftworks also has Cajun seasoning, Old Bay and Frank's hot sauce to serve on fries."
"5.0","A haven for the breathing. Anyone with a pulse will like this place. I personally prefer it over their warehouse brewpub. It operates more as a test house than the permenant brewpub. Beer types are fleeting here, and part of the fun is showing up knowing you'll always get to try something new. That said, there are certain beers (ahemm Whispering Canary) that I wish would remain on the 3705 menu. I was also a bit disappointed to see that the entree menu was taken off. Sandwiches are great, don't get me wrong, but I actually think the intimate atmosphere at this location is better for entrees than the warehouse. Tldr? The beer here rules and they always have something good for the plate."
"4.0","This place is perfect if you've had a rough day and want to go somewhere to have a relaxing, homemade dinner. The people there treat you like family and the food is awesome.You can buy make- your-own pastas and the tomato sauce is the best!!! The fried ravioli entree is really yummy too.The only thing I can say as a semi-'ehh' about this place is that they don't have just a regular meat lasagna!  The appetizers are really good, but for instance if you order their provolone sticks, it only comes with three. Not exactly enough to share with another person. They give you complimentary bread to start though.The Abby Alexandra's Angel Hair entree is very good as well. I should also mention that their proportions are huge! I always have leftovers no matter how hungry I am walking in.All in all, this place is a gem. The people are soooo friendly and it's a really enjoyable environment to be in. Great for a casual drink, a nice dinner with your family or even a lo-key dinner date. The food is awesome and it's well worth a trip to this area of town if you don't live close."
"5.0","Umami, meaning savory, is one of the 5 basic tastes (other ones are sweet, sour, bitter, and salty).  It also translates to deliciousness, which is exactly what this restaurant is, lots of yumminess. Umami Pittsburgh is set up as an izakaya, which are usually casual pubs Japanese businessmen tend to hang out in after work.  This one is a bit fancier and more Americanized.  The decor, including the narrow sets of stairs you have to walk up, tries to mimic that pub environment, making it a fun yet classy place.My partner and I came in early, about an hour before our group's reservation. We came in around 6:15pm on a Friday afternoon and just made the Happy Hour (which ends at 6:30pm). The place wasn't too busy yet so we sat ourselves at the bar without a wait. I ordered the Violet Snow because of  the lychee calpico ofc, and he got the House sake.  Mang, my drink was dangerous, I could not taste an ounce of the rum, just the sweet lychee flavor.Umami has a small separate area to accommodate larger parties. At first, it looked like we had to sit Japanese style, but there is sort of a sub level area for your legs! It was really cool and creative.  I'd highly recommend trying to get that area if possible. But it'd be hard to fit anything more than 8 people, which we had.  It got cozy.My favorite foods of the night were (1) Takoyaki (octopus balls), it came piping hot and full of flavor. It comes 6 per order, we got two plates. (2) Whole squid robatayaki, which is essentially sliced grilled squid, the smokey flavor was on point. (3) creme br√ªl√©e, not Japanese, but better than the fried ice cream imo, which had too much dough and not enough ice cream.  My main entree was the tonkatsu ramen, which is a bit different than the ones I'm used to. It had pork ribs instead of the usual cha shu, also was on the salty instead of creamy side. Good, but not my favorite.I'd definitely recommend Umami for the atmosphere, drinks and 'bar food', it's a fun late night place. Parking seems to be paid street parking."
"5.0","This review is solely based on their food as we only do take out from here. BUT nothing compares in my book to the quality and portion size of their meals. For Chinese take out, it's a bit pricer than other places, but well worth it. Every time I order from here I am never disappointed, and I always have leftovers because it's just so much food Their egg rolls are so big and delicious and they also make their own duck sauce that they always include in the order. The only downside is that their location is not super convenient (unless you live downtown), but worth the traffic and drive to get this delicious Chinese food."
"1.0","I'm not sure who owns or manages this place but it's a hot mess. I highly doubt it will be open in a year despite its strong opening. It's addition to the neighborhood hasn't been fantastic and it's quickly built a reputation for itself due to negative employee behavior and erratic hours.  For example, on multiple occasions, I've gone in to get the family their individual pizzas for dinner. Staff closed early. There is no rhyme or reason to when this place is open. They just lock the doors before the closing time and clean up. No note posted, no reason. It's ridiculous. Another time I attempted to enter and they told me they were closing and to leave. The other issue is consistency. There is none.  There is the potential for a great product but this location is all over the place. Sometimes they serve my kid a pile of mushy bread. Other times the crust is burnt and hard with toasted toppings.  I don't understand how something that is a chain and that should run smoothly is falling apart so quickly.  What I do know is this- despite having liked the convenience and concept of this location, I'm tired of wasting my time & money going here. I won't be returning."
"1.0","Let's start by saying this was my favorite pizza place in the whole Pittsburgh region for over 5 years, but this last experience has ruined it for me and I can promise I will never give them a dime of mine in the future. I ordered a pizza on a Friday night (with my credit card) to the hotel I was staying in. Pizza Romano had my phone number but failed to call me, instead they say that the front desk called my room. Next thing you know two 'older men' picked up the pizza in the lobby and even gave a big tip according to PR. I have given Pizza Romano hundreds of dollars over the years and would never dispute a $21 charge without good reason, such as not receiving it. When I tried to call the next day, they argued with me, swore at me, mocked me, and called me names. They said I was lying and that I did receive the pizza and that I sent down two older men. They never called me, nor did they have me sign a credit card slip. I never received the pizza, I was charged for it and ultimately they hung up on me without solving any issue I had. I have disputed the charge through my credit card company and am completely disgusted with the way I was treated. My family owns a small business and I know how important it is for respect and communication, and I just wanted to be refunded for the pizza I never received. I do not know if they did come and deliver to someone who is clearly not me, or if they just took advantage of my credit card number and ended it there. Beware, because this clearly is not the first time this happened according to other reviews!!!"

"5.0","Oh my gosh - what a charmer ! Cool funky atmosphere , amazing craft cocktails - had the seasonal Boots with the Fur , and an order of smoked Gouda Mac and cheese .Seriously a perfect combo on the top of Mt Washington!"
"4.0","Technically, I think this would be a 5 star review, mostly because I think the price points, particularly on the bevs could be a bit more reasonable and the charcuterie was amazing, but needs some balance.  However, I was in hog heave with the food. I felt like a Griswald and went full on greedy piggy... eating the pigs.  The charcuterie was decedent, though it seemed a bit haphazard, busy, and lacked in some base items. I mean, throw a couple crackers on the thing. The octopus and pork belly were amazing. Rich, decedent, and reasonably priced. I was disappointed in the bone-in pork chop. There was no bone and it took some serious sawing to work through. I have the feeling it was a substitute cut. Still, a lovely dish that I'd be more than happy to order again. I was on a pork high, so no pic available. The desert was solid, a nice rich creamy sweet sense to counter the waves of salty pork goodies preceding."
"5.0","Absolutely delicious food, melt-in-your mouth lyonnaise potatoes and crepelike pancakes.  It's tiny, cheek-by-jowl and often a long line on the weekends, but worth the wait and the cash-only inconvenience.I can't speak to anything but the breakfast food since I've never been able to get past it!My husband and I who lived within walking distance (or waddling distance, when leaving to go home) would normally split a hotcake special with the ham and cheese omelet.  That way we each could get eggs, meat, pancake, and potato cravings fulfilled.  When I went without him, I would either get the breakfast special or the corned beef hash with a side of the hotcake, regular.  My favorite hotcake flavor was the banana and chocolate chip, but occasionally we would get the strawberry or blueberry - don't be afraid by the sour cream ingredient.  It tastes AMAZING, and not too rich. (any richer, with the buttery hotcakes it would be over the top and make it more like dessert than breakfast).Their hot cocoa is probably from the package, but made decadent by the generous dollop of whipped cream that floats majestically on top.I once sat next to Franco Harris at the next table.  If he and Obama eat their hearts out here, you'll do fine.  Come try it already!"
"5.0","Great oysters and lobster mac and cheese. Great place to eat tapas style--they have a long selection of amazing seafood appetizers. Only weakness I would note is that maybe it is a bit too loud."
"4.0","Delicious beautifully displayed matcha cheesecake a bit small for $12. Feels like you walk up 2 flights right into Japan. Will have to return for the food."
"5.0","This is quite simply the best Thai food in Pittsburgh.  I have been to all the other Thai joints in the city, and this one is the best.  The food is consistently good and cheaper than many of the other places.  The curries are nicely done.  The pad Thai is excellent (although I prefer the pad see ew).  Tom Kar soup is awesome.  Service is prompt, friendly, and efficient.  The ambiance may be a little lacking, but the food more than makes up for it.  Almost forgot to mention that it is BYOB."
"1.0","Yesterday we visited Red Beards for a quick lunch before the Pirates game. We got there around noon and proceeded up the steps as the downstairs was full, there was no one at the podium to greet us, and no signage saying to see the hostess. On the second level we were greeted by a clearly flustered server telling us to see the hostess downstairs to be seated. So we went back down the steps. The hostess then took us upstairs to seat us. Okay, fine, I burned a few calories. When we got back upstairs the hostess tried to sit us and the same flustered server stopped her, said some inaudible things about another sever, yada yada yada, so we get led to a different table (maybe in a different servers section but at any rate this should have been seamless to us, the customer). After about 5 minutes a nice young lady comes and takes our drink order. This is about 12:05 at this point. She comes back about 12:10 and delivered said drinks and takes our order. Great! We are on par to make it to the game by 1. She stops back over about 12:20 and delivers small plates, says it should not be much longer. 12:30 she won't make eye contact. 12:40 she breezes past our table and ignores us calling to her. 12:50 and still no food. Now we ordered nachos, fried zucchini, and a chicken wrap. There is no WAY it should have taken 40 minutes to make this food. There were empty tables all around us. Since our server would not acknowledge us and we waited 40 minutes and still did not have food we got up and walked out. Not to mention it was SO LOUD!!! They had the sound for the TV blaring and I had to yell at someone sitting a foot from me. Super disappointing and not going back."
"4.0","Good taco truck in the heart of the strip! We had the carnita on a corn tortilla and it had good flavor. Instead of choosing American or Mexicano toppings alone, we asked for everything on it... that was the right call! The meat was tender and the hot sauce has a nice kick!There usd only one table, so it's a stand and eat kind of place.also, it is cash only, so I was lucky to scrounge up enough to get the $2.50 taco!"
"4.0","Pierogi Pizza. That's all I have to say when it comes to Rialto's, or pizza in general in Pittsburgh. I'm not from the city, so it was a surprise to learn that such a slice of heaven existed. And when I moved to the Greenfield/Squirrel Hill neighborhood - just minutes from Rialto's corner shop - I knew I had to try it. The combination of lightly spread garlic sauce with creamy mashed potatoes, sweet saut√©ed onions, and satisfying cheddar and mozzarella cheeses was the perfect first meal to devour in my new home."
"3.0","I understand that seafood is expensive but man I just can't justify going here.  And I'll shell out for good food.The food is ok, but not the wow experience that I've come to expect from the Pittsburgh food scene."
"5.0","Amazing food . Unlike many Indian restaurant which put oodles of oil and spices, this one cooks in authentic Indian home style with required amount of oil and flavours.worth for money"
"5.0","'Veggie Pizza' I like this cafe because they shave allergy sensitive options and everything is fresh, organic, and great tasting."
"5.0","Delicious tacos! Great price! Super friendly staff! The chicken tacos are my favorite! 2 tacos is usually good for me, even though I really want a third! They make the tacos right in front of you. Quick service. Great tunes. Definitely recommend. Open late on weekends which is a great plus for late night food if you want something light!"
"5.0","Umami 100% lived up to my expectations and more. I've heard people rave about the restaurant and finally got to try it this weekend. Atmosphere is AWESOME. You feel transported out of Pittsburgh. Everything is small plates/shareable for the most part, so my BF and I tried a little bit of everything. Started off with the Waygu and pork belly robatayaki, which was AMAZING. Also had the pork dumplings, soooo good. The salmon and tuna sashimi which was undeniably so fresh along with a spicy tuna onigiri. The magura, spicy tuna hand roll was also delicious. I loved how every item had it's own special serving vessel and each piece was made to order. So delicious. We were so happy to try this place out. It's outstanding!"
"5.0","I can't believe there aren't more reviews for this place... I didn't get a chance to look around the store - I went for a meal in Maria's kitchen upstairs.  It really is HER KITCHEN, not a restaurant... There is only one table that seats 8-10 people.  But her cooking is amazing.  Lots of home-style italian favorites come out in a fabulous 6 course meal.  I could have eaten just the antipasti alone as a full meal; the standout was a baked pumpkin full of gruyere, herbs and croutons... delicious.  For dinner, we had butternut squash soup with gorganzola and pecans, homemade pasta with a pistachio cream sauce, veal chops and an italian vegetable medely that was perfect with everything else.  Tiramisu for desert.  Everything that came out was delicious and perfectly prepared - plus Maria was standing right there in the kitchen to answer any questions we had about the food or cooking in general.  Wine was BYOB, and I think we went through ~10 bottles.  No corkage fees...This is an amazing dinner for those who have patience.  Maria is booked around 7 months in advance for those looking for a weekend date.  Do like I did - make your reservation, put it on the calendar and be patient... it's worth the wait."
"5.0","My goodness! What's to be said that hasn't already been spoken! Thai Gourmet is amazing! The ingredients are quality and fresh, the atmosphere is welcoming and the spice levels are true to expectations! I recently went there for a dinner with some friends and the Thai fried rice was messed up delicious. You will notice the reviews that say that the portions are huge and that is absolutely correct. However, I managed to stuff my face until my plate was empty and I am well known for leaving a plate pretty full! I ordered a 7...solid for anyone looking for as much heat as possible without overpowering the nuances of the dish. Nothing negative to say in the slightest. Perfect meal."
"2.0","Came here for the lunch buffet with a large group and had an okay experience. We were all in a famished state and wanted Indian food, and Prince of India was very conveniently located for us. We were the only party in the restaurant so it was pretty quiet and the buffet was not crowded. However, the food was extremely subpar. Most fried items were over cooked, the entrees lacked flavor, and nothing tasted very authentic."
"5.0","If you're here on a Sunday with a date, get the $25 for 2 deal! You get 2 entrees, one appetizer, and one bread (naan) for only $25. We had the chicken 65 as our appetizer, garlic naan as our bread, and chicken tikka masala and chicken makhani as our entrees (which come with a delicious side of soup or vegetables). The dishes may be somewhat spicy, so ask for mild spiciness levels if you can't handle the spice. There is no extra cost for more rice, and there are huge portions here! We had enough leftovers for 2 more meals, making it really worth the price that we paid. Service was excellent and the location was great as it is nestled in the heart of Oakland near student apartments."
"5.0","We were a party of 13. We got to the bar about 1/2 hour before our reservation. We hung at the bar for a bit. The hostess at first tried to tell us we had to be seated in 6 min. We laughed and told her once seated, that table was full for the night! She came back and said whenever we are ready.What can I say about the food? It's outstanding as all cap grilles are! We had numerous appetizers, hot and cold. Everything was great. The bone-in filet, although not in the menu, is a death row meal. Mashed potatoes were awesome. Everything was great. Service perfect."
"4.0","Decent lunch options and tasted really fresh and delicious. I had the prosciutto sandwich with a green salad. Also tried part of their club sandwich.  Both were a home run. Would definitely return again."
"4.0","I've lived in the area for over three years and I must have passed this place hundreds of times but last week was the first time I dined here.  I totally regret having passed this place up!The problem is, this place is across from Silky's which I know and love, and based on the exterior I assumed this was a very expensive restaurant geared towards the 50+ crowd.  It *is* nice inside, but when we dined here I was in sweat pants and not an eyebrow was raised.  Full disclosure:  I was dying at the end of a long urban hike, and we were right next to Alexander's and I told my friend I would hate him forever if he did not buy me pasta RIGHT.NOW.  :)  Alexander's totally hit the spot.  It was so good!  I was really surprised!  I had the chicken bruschetta and it was DELCIOUS.  I'd had the same item at Del's a few weeks ago and Del's cannot hold a candle to Alexanders.  My chicken breast was only slightly seasoned which is a sign of a good, confident chef.  The chicken was delicious and perfect and came out tasting like well seasoned chicken, not salt.It came with a side of pasta in any sauce I wanted from their lengthy list of sauces.  I chose penne in gorgonzola cream sauce.  The gorgonzola sauce was extremely strong.  VERY cheesy.  I like gorgonzola, but it was a bit strong for me--although it was still very good.My friend had a spaghetti and marinara in the marinara was incredible.  You can tell its made on site.  It was excellent.  Our entrees came with side salads which were very good, and there was bread nad oil on the table for dipping although we didn't get into that too much.  I will def be back, and if you havent tried alexander's, I recommend it.Its good, and you're not going to go broke eating here."
"4.0","Super cute place. Bright, clean and friendly service. I had the bacon, egg, and cheese croissant sandwich which I enjoyed. It was a substantial sandwich for me and quite filling. As another reviewer mentioned, the croissant is not the flaky, puffy croissant that  you would get from a French bakery. I got a delicious chocolate chip cookie on my way out. Happy to have happened upon this family owned eatery."
"1.0","This was the worst meal. I had clients with me so making a fuss was not an option. Two tiny pieces of chicken piccata that was so over-cooked it tasted like shoe leather. A small side of paste with canned red sauce. Bread was stale and not what I would expect from an Italian restaurant. No salad for $18 ... a terrible value.  There are much better options in the city, this isn't one of them. Overall service was marginal, considering they were not busy."
"4.0","I have eaten here a handful of times and the food is good and the staff always makes me smile and have me laughing so hard. I appreciate their energy!!"
"5.0","This place is hands down the best Japanese restaurant in Pittsburgh. It has a calm, relaxed atmosphere, friendly wait staff, and is authentic as you are likely to get this far from the west coast.They offer a wide variety of Japanese dishes. From sushi to sukiyaki to chawanmushi (even takowasa, if you're feeling adventurous).  They offer dishes for less experienced eaters, as well as catering to people looking to try something new. I have never had a bad meal here.I will say it can get pricey, but never unjustifiably so.  Honestly, if you're in the mood for some real Japanese and don't mind spending the extra money for quality, I can't recommend a better place in the city."
"4.0","Maybe 'yinzer good' isn't always such a bad thing. I went here the other morning and was quoted a 25-30 minutes wait time. It took 50 minutes. That seemed to be pretty standard so be prepared for that. Once we got in and ordered, the food came out almost immediately making the wait time more worth it. The hot cakes were delicious but be prepared for more buttery goodness than one should consume in a month. The potatoes were also half butter. I thought they tasted great if not a tad salty. The orange juice is more affordable than in most breakfast places but it wasn't mind blowing, I doubt it was fresh squeezed. My husband ordered eggs and hash which were also good but overly salty. We left feeling stuffed, guilty, and knowing that while the food was tasty our waistlines could only handle eating there once every couple of months."
"5.0","Beautiful ambiance and interior exterior design, unique umbrella sky decor at the patio and elegant collection of art pieces on the walls of dining room. The food is absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, and very pleasing. I especially enjoy the both savory and sweet crepes and the mellow romantic music ."
"4.0","I'll give this a 4 only because I typically reserve a 5 for more 'fine dining'.  But this place is great!Here are the things I liked about it...-Over the bar there are 6-8 very large screen TVs.  I came in on a night when the Pirates had a chance to clinch a playoff spot and asked if they'd turn on another game for me (I'm not local).  They had no problem with this.  And they were quick about it.  They also have subscriptions to many channels, so it wasn't difficult.  This said, if you want to watch a non-Pittsburgh team, this is the best bar in the city to go -I sat at the bar.  Wasn't too crowded on a Wednesday night.  Good service and friendly bartenders-Very good beer selection.  All the basics, a few local brews-Menu was typical 'pub food' but they had a VERY wide range of selection of sauces for their wings to the point they compete with the likes of Buffalo Wild Wings in that regard.  I ordered the cheesy jalape√±o at the suggestion of the bartender, and they didn't disappoint.  Their house made chips were also really goodI'll definitely go back when I'm in town."
"4.0","The burger I ate was great! I cannot give it 5 stars because our food was put in by our waitress in two waves. One person's food came out a good 10 minutes before the rest of ours."
"4.0","Had a nice breakfast with the boyfriend! The food was delicious and cooked in a healthy manner. Everything seemed really clean and not overly cooked with oils.Reason why I took off a star was because the food took over 30 mins to get to us and one of the meals was pretty cold. @theabchick approved healthy restaurant!!"
"4.0","I've only ordered delivery from this place -- and I'm judging it as it compares to other Pittsburgh delivery food (which I sometimes have to order, but is generally disappointing or even gross).  For a positive review this will sound slightly harsh, but I'm trying to make the distinction between real food (fresh, whole ingredients) and other things (like delivery tends to be), so I won't generally say that delivery is the best thing ever.  Ok, on with it...Everything I've gotten from here has been pretty good.  The sandwiches (subs) are actually edible -- and if you like the filling, the panini is way better.  The subs/panini have more 'whole' ingredients, and I like the Kufta quite a bit!Most places get their appetizers from some 'make your own pizza restaurant' frozen food service, and I think these guys do too (onion rings, okra, etc).  But, the food generally arrives less greasy and still crispy.  The pizza crust tastes less like a bunch of spongy preservatives, and more like food.  It's on the thinner side, by the way, and I think their sauce is good too.  Love getting pizza and a Moroccan sandwich in one place!I also have to think that the people that work here are awesome, because both delivery guys I've met have been super nice!"
"2.0","I 'ate' here today for restaurant week. I put 'ate' in quotes because each of the courses was so bad that I only took one bite. The lobster bisque was the consistency of pudding and had very little flavor. The sushi roll had an overpowering bitter taste. And the key lime pie had a disappointing filling, at least the crust was ok. The server did replace the lobster bisque with the Manhattan clam chowder, which was better but contained no seafood. I have two stars because I had been here before and thought it was pretty good. But this experience was one of the worst I've had at any 'higher quality' restaurants. I am literally walking to go eat somewhere else as I write this because I am still hungry. I'd rather go get a pepperoni roll on the street than eat here again."
"1.0","Watching hockey,guy from outside comes in asks to change tv station, staff doesn't ask anyone at the bar if they're watching and changes the station. ( to drag racing none the less) The same guy then goes back outside . Really !!!!  Really need to learn how to make margaritas esp. in summer !!  Customers had to ask for service, place needs a good rocket under the service staff feels like guests are imposing on them.  Won't be back will find sushi somewhere else. Just remember not everyone who enters your restaurant is a tourist, do it right or don't do it !!"
"5.0","Unbelievable drink selection, the bartenders are very attentive/helpful. The food menu is limited but most food choices are really good. They do change up the menu however the pulled chicken sandwiches and pork tacos were tasty."
"5.0","A fantastic place to grab brunch on a weekend! We tried the special Banana Walnut Hotcakes and that was sooo delish! We also ordered the Corned Beef Hash and Eggs and that Corned Beef was even better than the ones from Le Peep back in NJ!SO wish we had a Pamela's back home and the prices in Pitt was VERY cheap comparing to NYC and NJ!  PS: This is a CASH-ONLY place and setting is very much like a diner, but AWESOME food. ENJOY!"
"4.0","Cute but empty.... I had been looking forward to going to this bakery for quite a while and finally went there to get something cute for my boyfriend's grandma for thanksgiving dinner.  I'm not sure if it's because today is the day before the big holiday, but there weren't many things left...  And I was so disappointed. All I got were two boxes of macaroons.  They look cute, but I wish I could have more choices. I'll probably go again sometime later when it wasn't one day before a big holiday, hoping that I could find some cream puffs too."
"4.0","We went here 2 years ago and spent hours here. We loved the open garage doors and small intimate, dim lit setting. There are board games on shelves you can play. 2 years ago we each tried 4-5 drinks (lushes, I know) and they were all amazing. We came back, so excited, to have more delicious drinks. I was pleased to see their cocktails were the same- and they also had new seasonal ones. We love to try new things, so we ordered off the seasonal list. Regretfully, none of those cocktails were as great as their staple ones. So I recommend just sticking to their staple drinks!! We got the cheese board and we were not impressed. It came with white bread toast-  undercooked yet burn lines ...? 3 smelly cheeses and nuts and 3 jellies. The jellies were the best thing about the cheese board but they weren't anything out of this world. Don't get the cheese board, and just stick to the staple cocktails!"
"5.0","The corned beef hash here is the best corned beef hash I've ever had. Everytime I visit Pittsburgh, it's a must-eat! The lines can get long so I try to come closer to closing time when the restaurant is less busy."
"4.0","Hubs and I decided to come here on a Friday night for dinner. We were able to get a seat with ease, keeping in mind it was the weekend before the holidays and we were doing a later dinner.We were seated in the back dining room. It's a flashback to the past in a comforting way, with Fiesta plates. We ask for the drink menu and see a variety of wine and beer options. The wines don't list the vineyards, so it was difficult to discern. The beers included a good number of local crafts.The specials include entrees and salad or dessert. It was a bit more food than we wanted, so we opted for the traditional menu. The seafood Devonshire caught my eye as did the veal diablo. Hubs was curious about the make your own pasta but at the mentioned of the veal diablo and options paralysis, he knew what he wanted.We ordered and the waitress was helpful with the wine selection, noting the Chanti hubs ordered was on the sweet side, so he was able to swap it out for the dryer option. The food comes out within a reasonable time and it piping hot. The waitress realize she forgot our bread and brings it out, very much needed with the amount of sauce in out entrees. The veal diablo is delicious. I took a bite and was wowed by the spicy flavor. The seafood Devonshire is creamy and rich. The tart/pie crust was fluffy. The crab meat is imitation, so keep that in mind.Overall solid meal, good service, and large portions. It was a bit pricey for a neighborhood spot."
"1.0","Do not go here before a game. The food tasted fine but the service was so delayed we almost missed the opening pitch. Our purpose of being in Pitt was the game so this was NOT the place for us!"
"4.0","I'm not even joking best fried pickles I've ever had. Also, our waiter Kyle was so helpful and had a great sense of humor. Go for the pickles, but stay for Kyle.I can't say how good anything else is on the menu, except the sauerkraut and potato pirogies were also good."
"4.0","The tacos are very tasty--I'd say the best you'll find in Pittsburgh. I am docking them a little because I think they are a little pricier than what I would like. But I try to get to their location whenever I am in town."
"2.0","If you are trapped downtown, I can see this being a good place for variety sake, but in terms of Asian food, I've had much better Asian food in desert towns like Reno and Tempe.  Now, I don't think it is fair to stack a business against the comparisons of the best in other U.S. cities, so I really only am basing this review on the moderate level expectations I had after reading the other reviews that made me want to try this restaurant.Unfortunately my experience was so disappointing that I doubt I will try eating here again.  I tried the War Shew duck dish (BREADED) - it was tough which I've never had tough duck to this degree but the breading I didn't expect at all - expected crispy duck from duck skin not weird breadcrumb style. I should have clued in from the 'golden fried' description on the webpage but I was thinking more along the lines of a golden fried duck skin.  I did not finish the dish. The other dish I had was a chow mein dish with vegetables in it but I can't remember what it was because it was just glutinous uninspired slop.Just so disappointing."
"5.0","Every bite at this relaxed open plan restaurant was delicious. Lamar, the server, was energetic and friendly, and there was no drama getting me seated. I had the Polish Hill burger- which has a fried pierogi on top. The burger tasted like a homemade beef patty, the pierogi was fresh and chewy in just the right way, and the fries were superb (and salty). Really just a delicious meal."
"5.0","I had this amazing curry at a different restaurant and I was raving about it to all my friends, most of them just smiled and said 'oh really?' But the REAL Thai food lovers all recommended me to try Thai Gourmet. My one friend, who was born and raised in Thailand told me that TG is the most authentic, best Thai in Pittsburgh; usually when I have THAT high of expectations t's usually not up to par BUT TG blew me out of the water.The food? Oh my goodness gracious... My friends and I ordered summer rolls as an appetizer, Pad Thai, another noodle dish, and panang Curry with a side of Tom Yum soup and fried spring roll. Let me ask you, how can EVERYTHING be SO EXCEPTIONAL? I was shocked of the deliciousness level of every single item.. I felt like a queen. My friends and I (who were all first TG timers) all agreed that this is the best Thai restaurant in Pgh AND the best Thai we've ever had.The staff was so kind and considerate. Prices were very fair, this place has me sold I'm a regular now!!"
"1.0","Very dissatisfied! First meal did not taste good. Asked waitress to have them bring something different. The second dish had a fruit fly on the plate. Four people walked over confused by what was wrong and an employee asked if I wanted her to replace it. She said she would still eat it with a fruit fly because it's 'nature'. Then gave an example of finding a ladybug at another restaurant as she still ate it. Ummmm, I'm good-I don't want it! I didn't know what they would do with the food back I. That kitchen!"
"5.0","Chinatown Inn is great! Service is great and the food is amazing! The atmosphere is very relaxed. I love eating at the restaurant more than when we have ordered take out..it just tastes better when you eat at the actual restaurant! The prices are affordable, and they offer a giant eggroll as well as a normal sized one! Everyone should support this Chinese restaurant, especially if  you want quality food!"
"5.0","Chinatown Inn is defiantly my favorite Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. My family had been coming here since it's beginning, the staff is always very friendly and positive. My favorite dish is the Spicy War Shew Guy Chicken (No Lettuce) the pieces of chicken are lightly fried and are always juicy, this brown sauce that is on the chicken is the perfect combination of spicy and savory. They also have hands down the best shrimp egg rolls in the city. The Szechuan Chicken is also delicious. Take it from a Yinzer, give this place a try!"
"5.0","Salem's has my favorite chicken gyro (and I've tried quite a few).  Most places seem to treat the humble chicken gyro as an afterthought by chopping up some chicken and putting it on pita bread, but Salem's has a delicious blend of spices and is juicy even without the cucumber sauce.  Plus it's HUGE!  First time coming I got the combo with fries, but it was way too much food for one meal (still delicious, I just didn't have a way to keep the leftovers).  The restaurant itself is plainly appointed with rows of tables.  It's been busy every time I've gone, but that's a testament to the food they serve."
"2.0","Had been wanting to try this place for a while but did not want to venture into south Oakland. It kind of just pops out of no where on south bouquet street. There is some seating, but I opted for take out. I came for lunch and it was pretty empty. I ordered the lamb kufta panini and then waited about 10-15 minutes. I didn't mind because at least then I knew it was fresh. Once I got home and opened it though I realized that they had given me a chicken panini instead of lamb. I guess the person taking the order didn't quite understand since English was not his first language. The chicken was alright nothing special had some type of seasoning on it. The panini was pretty good with the star being the beta bites dressing. It's a creamy dressing made with garlic and cilantro. The fries were also fine but pretty oily. Overall, a mediocre place to grab a bite but nothing special. Very greasy so did not feel great after."
"4.0","This is our favorite for Indian food.  Prices are good.  It crazy busy for lunch. Portions are large. Service is fast. Customer service is lacking. Sure would be nice to be greeted properly."
"1.0","The food tastes like barf (coming up, not going down). Yesterday I ordered a dosa that came with a small cup of vegetable soup on the side.  The soup tasted a bit off, and I only had a few bites, but it was enough.  Today I have done nothing but puke.In fairness, we ordered three different dishes last night, and nobody else in my family is throwing up today, so if you think that two out of three ain't bad, Tamarind might be just the place for you."
"2.0","Decided to stop by for lunch with a buddy.  In terms of being a celiac.... this place may raise your anxiety, but in return you'll be able to try some tasty food.  So, my encounter started a bit poorly with a small language barrier with the waiter.  Basically, I tried to explain that i was gluten free, which somehow turned into him thinking I wanted my food for free and that I was a student.  I will say he did cheerfully address my perceived questions, even if the explanations made no sense in terms of my actual questions.  Before we both became overtly frustrated I asked to speak to someone else, which resulted in me speaking to the chef.  The chef said ' everything is gluten free, ' and then rolled back to the kitchen.  So, like many in the celiac community, this made me rather uncomfortable as clearly there were items containing wheat ( the naan).  Anyway, I was with a buddy and decided to be brave for once ( while still picking a relatively safe menu item).  I chose the chicken tikka.  Though the waiter did offer me naan with it (which i declined), and growing anxiety I did try the dish.  The chicken tikka was in a thicker sauce (looked like it might have been reheated, but no judgment) than I'm used to and I had approximately five chunks of chicken in total in the dish... The rice was well cooked and when paired with the sauce it made an addictive combination.  The chicken chunks were rather large, moist, and shredded well.  Best of all, to my delight the chef was correct.  No contamination issues and i'd vouch for the gluten free nature of the chicken tikka.  In review, if you are gluten free and feeling brave you might want to try Prince of India.  If you aren't gluten free... well the buffet looked really nice and as I was informed by my buddy it was pretty tasty."
"4.0","The restaurant is nice and spacious. The staff is friendly and attentive. If you go for lunch during the week, they make sure to get you your food quickly, however it is very pricey. It's a nice date night for dinner and the food isn't bad."
"5.0","Love this place. What a gem. It's like local bodega meets Whole Foods what with the feel of the place and the quality of the products offered. Feel so lucky to have them in my neighborhood. The staff is friendly, the Goodness Grows eggs are fresh and flavorful with bright yellow-orange yolks, the sandwiches are delicious, and the sun-dried tomato spread and hummus are out of this world incredible. The cheese selection is AMAZING, too!! Think ricotta, mozzarella, and so much more. Plus, there is a seed library for any budding gardeners! The walls near the coffee station are replete with info about upcoming neighborhood events and groups. Just walking in this place always makes me smile.Love that this is a woman-owned, locally-run business that features local goods including local meats, eggs, vegetables, honey water (!!!) and even ice cream. I only wish they were open more hours of the week!!"
"3.0","My girlfriend brought me a few tacos and a bottle of white wine to keep me company during an extra long work day that required me to be there thru dinner. She had been craving tacos, so asked which proteins I wanted for my two tacos. I chose chicken and pork. It was my first time eating Doce Tacos take out and I was very excited as they have always been delicious on site. Was it because I was sober that they weren't as good as I remembered them to be? The corn tortilla shells were good, the toppings fresh and flavorful, but both the chicken and pork were dry and not good. The meats were served in nice portions in the tacos , and should have been the star of the show. Sadly, no. I will give them another chance and go back to eat a few tacos after a few strong drinks to see if it helps their review.I gave them three stars because they have always been good before so I have not written them off."
"1.0","It looked so promising. I saw the cute outdoor counter/walk up window the day before and thought I'd give it a shot. Walking in, staff seemed a bit frazzled and there was small confusion about seating. They were apologetic and I was seated.I ordered a coffee as I looked over the menu. Another waitress came by and asked what I wanted. Mocha French toast, please. I sat and waited and watched more frazzled encounters with other patrons. I checked in on Yelp (free coffee) and was playing with my phone. A waiter comes by and asks about my check in redemption on Yelp after I've toggled away. It was a bit creepy watching what patrons are doing on their phones.After that strange encounter and over 30 minutes later did the two slices of French toast arrived. It's covered in chocolate syrup and that was all I could taste. I move some of it off while cutting the toast. Not exactly what I was expecting, but at this point, I've waited long enough and needed to get on with the day. The first slice is fine, but then here's where it went bad. Into the second toast, I tasted the egg batter and spit it out. Thinking it might have been a bad edge, I cut another piece and more egg batter and I immediately spit it out. I'm done and worried. A waitress sees my expression. I informed her it wasn't cooked completely and another waiter comes to examine the toast. Odd, but they take it away. I'm done.Yet another waitress comes by to check on me. I'm done, I say (Really? Why would I want more?). She comes with the check. Here's the kicker, they charged me the full amount even coffee! It wasn't edible! Raw egg batter!!Ugh. Tired of the experience, I pointed out the coffee check in and was told it'll be taken care of. I was still charged for the French toast. That's when the waiter comes with fruit and gummy bears to apologize for the toast. No, grapes, slice of apple, kiwi, nectarine, and a couple of gummies doesn't make up for it. I'm already worried, a hodgepodge of stuff isn't what I want now.Staff tried, but missed the mark. The French toast was covered in chocolate syrup for anyone to notice it was still batter. Avoid it. I ended up getting sick. Also, they charge 50 cents for water, without telling people. It's a mini 8 ounce bottle. So much hope for this neighborhood spot and it failed in many ways."
"5.0","This place is awesome! Really cool vibe-casual seating, laid-back place to grab some good food. The service was extremely quick and efficient. Everyone was really friendly. The food was awesome. I got the chicken and waffles-the chicken was really good. It reminds me of chick-fil-a chicken with the southern fried style of cooking. I got them with the mild sauce-i like spicy so I might try medium next time. The waffles were very airy and delicious with a ton of maple syrup (if you aren't a fan of maple syrup, ask for it on the side). I was sad to see Qdoba go last year and wasn't sure if anything could replace it but I'm glad CHiKN has come around. Can't wait to come back!"
"5.0","If the place specializes in tea...I'm there! I found myself on the North Side and I just had to stop here.When I first walked in I'll admit that it's not what I expected. It was rather large and very inviting. I was greeted by the cashier and, after learning it was my first visit, she made some recommendations. Since I've been drinking hot tea for a few months now, I decided to go with their iced peach apple cobbler tea. My drink arrived with a few dashes of cinnamon on top. It was very, very good! I was surprised by the strength of the flavors since it can be hit or miss with some teas. This had the flavor of your granny's church cobbler and while it's unsweetened, the cinnamon lent a nice sweet flavor to it. This would be a great place to have a meeting,  map out a project or just chill. Chill was my goal today....mission accomplished. Very nice place with friendly and engaging service. I shall return."
"4.0","Who ever thought as a native Floridian that one of the best broiled fish sandwiches I've ever enjoyed would be in Pittsburgh? I sure didn't but that was certainly the case here.They serve a very large portion of fresh cod with Parmesan cheese, onion, lettuce, and tomato on fresh bread. This sandwich is a must try and comes with pretty good fries.The service was a little slow but that was okay since we were there with friends.I really enjoyed this place and will be back when I'm in town."
"4.0","Alexander's is a family/group-friendly restaurant that serves large portions of Italian-American food. The only person who was able to finish their meal was the one who ordered the asparagus salad. Everyone else took home copious pasta. Honestly, the calamari and fettuccini dish was enough to feed 3 or 4 people. The bread they serve is huge chunks of white Italian loaf. Service was good. Alcoholic drinks (beer, wine, cocktails) are available. Parking on the street (free on Sunday)."
"2.0","I really wanted to like this place because of all the positive reviews.  I love breakfast, and I am a sucker for corned beef hash (I order it pretty much when it's on a menu).  Sadly, I walked away from my meal with a 'meh' feeling.First off, I kept hearing about these pancakes I gotta try.  Well, I figured what better way to experience them than to order a short stack, right?  They were super buttery... Too much so.  I loved the thin fluffy texture, and the crispy edges were a unique touch, but those flap jacks were oozing butter (despite not using the included butter 'pat' that comes with them)... It's all I could taste.  Too bad.  People generally recommended the stuffed pancakes... Perhaps this well teach me not to listen to the suggestions for the banana chocolate chip pancakes (next time).My real disappointment was that the corned beef hash was probably just a few points above the stuff you can buy at the store.  If it weren't for the large pieces of crispy potatoes, or the sauteed onion... I would have sworn it came from a can.  Plus it was super salty and the meat over-ground... Kinda looked like pet food.  What happened to using chunks of real corned-beef and making the dish look like a hash?I'm a transplant to pitt and I'm still figuring the place out.  Nevertheless, I'm still looking forward to trying some the other recommended food items... But... If you want really good authentic corned beef hash: Tasty Diner in Silver Spring, MD.  Can't beat it."

"3.0","What burger joint charges you for a side of Mayo?  When you pay 13.00 bucks for a burger you expect condiments for free.NOT COMING BACK"
"5.0","By far the best tacos in Pittsburgh! Order the barbacoa,carnitas,or fish tacos! They are very authentic and I love that you can customize them with your own salsa at the salsa bar. Highly recommend going to the strip just for the tacos here!"
"3.0","I always go there since it is down the street from my job but they were off today. First they gave me the wrong meat in my sandwich which I did not notice until I got back to my desk. I went back to get the correct sandwich which they were great about correcting but it was cold.  my office is literally 2 mins from the store so I cannot understand how my food was cold when it's made to order. Other than today I enjoy their food but I will not be back for a long while. It left a bad taste in my mouth"
"2.0","Anyplace that has pierogies on the menu and brings me Mrs. T's frozen pierogies deserves a two star or less rating.  As someone who makes pierogies from scratch paying homage to my heritage, to say I was disappointed is an understatement.  I understand taking some short cuts here and there but I have a hard time believing in a city known for pierogies that some better local options aren't available.  Other than that, the service was fine, we had a larger group and our waiter kept up pretty well and was very friendly.  Drinks and the rest of our food was okay but nothing to write home about.  If you want standard bar food and aren't fussy about sourcing or who makes it then here's your spot."
"2.0","Really wanted a great breakfast including a great cup of coffee. Got a limp, bland omelet with steamed broccoli and clots of cheap chaddar. Im pretty sure it was flozen broccoli and bagged pre-shredded cheese. And, most sadly, the cup of coffee was weak.  My food was cold within 5 minutes of arrival thanks to the overdone air conditioning. My husband and I had to raise our voices to speak over the music... very loud in there. Sigh. Not keeping with the the 4 star yelp review that brought us here."
"3.0","Came here for dinner on a Sunday night, our second time since first eating at Tamarind last April.  Due to a few miscommunications, our second experience was a bit more negative than our first, after which we had initially felt as if we had found our go-to Indian restaurant located very conveniently near us.We had a reservation for our party of 6, which turned out to be handy, as the small dining room was full throughout most of our meal.  We loved the ambiance of the space in a renovated house, which was a bit noisy with all the tables filled but very homey feeling.  Our group of 3 couples each opted to do the Sunday night special of 'Dinner for 2' for $25: 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and a bread (lamb, seafood, and bread basket excluded).Chose the Chilly Gobi for the appetizer, expecting a stir-fried dish, as the menu describes this as 'saut√©ed.'  It came battered and deep-fried.  I verified with a server that this was the Chilly Gobi, as I thought maybe they had given me the Gobi Manchurian instead, a dish that the menu describes as 'battered cauliflower,' which I would understand to denote deep-frying.  The server responded that my dish was indeed the Chilly Gobi, and that it was typically deep-fried as all 'Manchurian-like' dishes tend to be.  I was disappointed, as I find this assumption to be a disconnect from how the menu describes the preparation.  If one dish is 'saut√©ed' and another is 'battered', it does not logically follow to me that both would be deep-fried.  The dish tasted great, but was just not what I wanted--I would have ordered something else had I been aware of this ahead of time.We ordered the Kadai with okra and the Tikka Masala with paneer for entrees.  The Kadai was a repeat order from our first visit, as I had enjoyed it immensely, but it came out much oilier than I had remembered.  It was still tasty, but after eating about a third of the dish, the rest was just sitting in a pool of sauce that was essentially just oil, rendering it a bit unappetizing.  Our Tikka Masala was tasty and fairly standard, but could have used more spices and depth of flavor, rather than just being very plainly sweet.Our friends ordered a Saag, an Aloo Gobi, a Vindaloo with chicken, and a Madras Masala Dosa, and seemed to really enjoy them.  In particular, the Saag was raved about, and the Dosa came wonderfully presented as a huge serving, cut into 4 pieces, though we were told it was the 'small' portion.Our table received our 3 orders of naan (2 garlic, 1 onion) combined in one basket but was not informed whether the basket was a single portion or combined for our entire table until we asked for verification.  The naan was very pleasantly fragrant and a great complement to our saucy Tikka Masala.Our final small miscommunication came with the bill, on which I tried to use a Restaurant.com deal I had purchased: $6 for $15 worth of food.  I was told that I could not combine this coupon with the Sunday Night 'Dinner for 2' deal.  I understand that it is often the case that discount offers can be combined, but I had verified this before purchasing the Restaurant.com coupon, and neither the stipulations for said coupon nor the 'Dinner for 2' deal on Tamarind's menu stated that either offer couldn't be combined with another.  Such restrictions should be made transparent.TL;DR the food is decent, but service leaves something to be desired.  We might be back due to its convenient location, but I now feel much more incentive to try All India one block up Craig St."
"2.0","Restaurant was slow, bunch of workers were standing around. As you can imagine service was not great. Food was ok. Wouldn't get pierogis app. Shrimp was great. Overall just so so."
"5.0","Three words: Peach Cobbler Tea. Yeah, that's a thing. I didn't know it was a thing until I walked into tea heaven. We need more dedicated tea houses like this gem. I absolutely loved that there were so many varieties to choose from. The Peach Cobbler Tea can be served hot or cold so since I'm weird, I got it hot in ninety degree weather. Not once did I feel like I needed to add sugar. I had no idea how I was going to top peach cobbler tea but to my surprise they did. I got a sandwich and when I said 'no bacon' they informed me that they have turkey bacon. This is no ordinary turkey bacon either. It's thick and it has a crunch that I've never had with turkey bacon. I need to know the sorcery behind the bacon because it was pretty life changing and changed the dynamic of this sandwich. Last but not least, the staff was so nice and knowledgeable of the menu. Great food, tea, and customer service isn't something you can fake so they've completely earned this five star review."
"4.0","A very good restaurant in the strip district.  Their seafood is fresh and they have an amazing burger for those who aren't interested in seafood.  They have a couple of local beers on tap.  The interior has a cool warehouse vibe."
"5.0","#1 go to brunch place in the city.. no matter what you choose from the menu it'll be great, beautifully served dish... make sure to check out the gorgeous back patio, rainbow umbrellas, nice service, the best coffee will give you all the vibes! P.S. Einstein is the sh*t"
"5.0","Outstanding food, lovely ambiance, and excellent service. Had a truly delightful evening thanks to Sausalido! We started off with bread and hummus-like spread, which was fantastic, and the smoked gouda and zucchini appetizers. The smoked gouda was basically a big fried melty gouda ball with pesto, and the zucchini was sprinkled with parm and had marinara sauce on the side. Delicious!The main courses-- which were the best part, although it did take a little while to come out so be patient! It will be worth it-- were the pork, salmon, strip steak, and crab cakes. I tried a bite of everyone's entree, and each bite was  phenomenal. The pork (my favorite) was juicy and tender-- cooked perfectly. The prices are a little on the higher side, but worth it especially for a special occasion. Reservations are highly recommended! They accept credit cards as well, which is another plus.I can't wait to go back!"
"4.0","My nephews birthday celebration was my reason to get me into the Azorean Cafe at his suggestion.  I was impressed by the decor and the thought put into it.  Very restful and calming.The food was new for me.  My nephew had the cod casserole which came with roll and it must have been great because I never heard a word out of him and only saw the top of his head until he was finished!As a new-comer, I opted for the American breakfast which came with a side of Chorizo sausage which is never a bad thing.  The eggs were perfectly cooked to order and I had those great homefries which have a bit of spice to them with the onions and the spicy red peppers.The coffee came in huge mugs and was always filled.  The service was pleasant and courteous.  They spoke about their cuisine and explained the origins and resources for their dishes.  It was a great experience and a first time exposure to food of the Azores.  I will be back."
"5.0","There were 7 of us in town for a ER nurse's conference and we wanted someplace for a happy hour. This place was great!!! We even threw our server off by moving tables together and adding 5 people to the table. He was totally cool with it!!! The food was excellent and we got a conference discount. Great place!!"
"5.0","I ordered this today for delivery. Absolutely delicious. Took about an hour from order until they got to my door. I live about 15-20 minutes away so I think that's pretty reasonable!!!! Highly recommend you try this food out."
"1.0","I was very disappointed in the lack of communication by front counter staff and 'I don't care' attitude. I ordered a sandwich from the children's menu and after I paid for it I noticed that I was charged for an adult sandwich. I also noticed I was charged additional for getting a different cheese when the menu states choose any cheese you want on your sandwich. When I asked about the kids price, I was told it's the same price as adults just a smaller portion. So why have a kids menu and now your cheating me out if my money cause your charging same amount for less food??? Makes no sense. Then I ask why was I charged for changing my cheese option when menu says I can. Answer, fresh mozzarella is more expensive. Why didn't you tell me that when I ordered. Your menu doesn't say that. Oh sorry. Ridiculous. It's not that I mind paying money for good food if warranted, but give me the facts and let me decide then. These are things that will make me never come back!!"
"3.0","I am not a huge pizza connoisseur, so I didn't find anything that terrible about their pizza. I got a deep dish, and it was pretty good. The small was more than enough for one person. The cheese was plentiful and the sauce tasted just fine for me. Maybe it's not the most authentic pizza in Pittsburgh, but it sure hit the spot!"
"4.0","Full disclosure: My first visit was a post-MRI treat and a Mediterranean diet cheat meal, so there was a lot riding on this outing!  The restaurant is shiny and new on the inside. I ordered a chicken sandwich meal with a spice level of 'hot,' crinkly fries, and lemonade. The cashier warned that the spice levels are a step up from usual spice, so she steered me to medium level spice. I obliged.   The order was 11.21 total. My order arrived at my table before I was done grabbing napkins and utensils - Impressive. And the sandwich. My goodness, the sandwich!!!  It was sizable and appealing to the eye. The first bite was superb - great blend of spices and the cole slaw and pickles provided a wonderful contrast to the heat. In certain bites, I thought the chicken was too salty, but overall the flavor is a win!  The fries were well-seasoned and crisp.  The medium wasn't all that spicy to me, so I'll level up next time I pay a visit. I didn't opt for a beer this time, but I think a nice, cold can of Rhinegeist or bottle of Purple Haze would brighten this otherwise excellent meal. Needless to say, I'm happy to have CHiKN as an option when in Oakland. What a great addition!"
"5.0","I have been a fan of the original Burgh'ers, located in Harmony/Zelienople since they first opened.  This new location in Lawrenceville, brings delicious farm-to-table burgers into the city.  This location is in a brand new building, and has a modern look, with a little bit of Pittsburgh flair to include black & gold seating.  Today was the first day of their soft opening to the public.  Most of the burgers on the menu are named after Pittsburgh neighborhoods (They do have some other items on the menu that are not burgers also).  Today I enjoyed a 'Bloomfied' burger, which has Swiss crisp saut√©ed greens, caramelized onions, fennel, mayo, and pepper flakes, and a side of fresh-cut fries.  The service was fast and friendly, and owner Chef Fiore even came out to ask me how everything was . . . it was excellent.  Look forward to coming back again, especially after they complete their liquor license so I can have a craft beer to go along with my burger."
"4.0","When I see that the food served is locally sourced not only am I delighted with it but I know I have to pay extra for it. This is the 2nd location of this restaurant that has the original in Harmony, PA. I liked the motif with the black and gold chairs perfectly arranged so that each table had at least one of each color.My waitress was very friendly and helpful in explaining the menu to me. One of the things of note is make sure you ask when ordering because there is an up-charge for most everything whether written or not. For example when I was deciding the type of bun I wanted for my burger I learned that a whole wheat bun would cost $1.00 extra. Most of your sandwiches come with a side of either French Fries or salad with dressing of your choice. If you want cole slaw then it is a $3.00 upcharge along with macaroni and cheese. Those are written on the menu. You can order sides but if you are price wary then make sure to ask before ordering.In addition to burgers you can order chicken sandwiches, salads,  BLT, or grilled cheese.You have several options when it comes to ordering burgers. You can either order a premade burger from their list or build your own burger. Your additional choices for an upcharge give you the following options: 'the blend' which means it will have part mushroom filler, 'the double down' which is about 1/2 pound of ground meat, and 'wild game' which would be another meat. In today's case it was bison for a $4.00 upcharge. Some of these burgers are can be veggie burgers or have no meat in them whatsoever.I decided to order the Forest Hills burger which came with blue cheese, sauteed mushroom. mixed greens and honey. I actually didn't have to wait too long for it. The salad side was indeed generous and the burger was cooked just to order and I could taste the freshness in it.  I had the feeling that even though the fries were good I knew I wouldn't be able to finish them.In addition to milkshakes made with Millie's ice cream, today they were offering ice cream sandwiches. The cost was about $7.00. The ice cream sandwich consisted of two cookies supplied by Mediterra bread and Millie's ice cream as a filler. I was told it would be large enough for two people to share so I decided to pass on it. Behind me stood the bar with hand crafted brews. At the far end was the chef's prep area. The place was very clean and I was very pleased with my lunch. I am looking forward to trying out their other location in Harmony, Pa when the occasion warrants it."
"4.0","Have been here during and after football season and it always busy with pre and post gamers along with tourists.  The bar and waitstaff is very attentive and willing to please.   The mens and womens room have an added feature. Enjoy!"
"5.0","Awesome food, great service and great people. I don't usually write reviews but I am a big foodie and love this place. Some dishes are as good as food in Thailand"
"5.0","So, so, so delicious.  Tasty, spicy, hot, sustaining, succulent, savory, all the descriptive words please.   Can I say I was so sad it was closed last night?  It's not open on Mondays.  It's just a little clean Indian food restaurant on the edge of North Oakland.  Wood floors in an old Victorian home.  It's like you are eating at someone's house, which is really cool, cause honestly, I prefer eating at home or at someone's house as opposed to a restaurant.  I've eaten at People's in Garfield and the old India House, and they don't even begin to compare.Their portions are big, and you always have some leftover at the end of the meal.  And I eat a lot, so that's saying something.  I basically gluttonous as an eater.  Anyhow, I digress.Go there, it's not too pricey, the service is ALWAYS good, and they always make sure you have enough water.  I wish I could remember what I get, but I can't.  It's always something Paneer (chicken or cheese).  Their nan is always perfect, like they just baked it in a old hearth.YUM!"
"4.0","Came to Burghers Brewing with my partner, craving burger, fries, and beer. Got a flight and then two full beers for $4 each thanks to the all day happy hour. We also tried the fried goat cheese, and each got a burger with rosemary fries. Everything was good, though I wouldn't order the fried goat cheese again -- too rich for my blood. The burgers were really soft (I had the shadyside and really enjoyed). The fries were pretty good too."
"5.0","Beta Bites has the best fries I've ever had. I tell everyone and I've gotten so many people addicted to them. Also their paninis are perfect, their sauces are amazing!"
"2.0","Redbeard's left much to be desired. I wanted the experience to be good but it really just wasn't. My fish sandwich though large was inedible. The staff was nice but seemed unphased by my displeasure even after I expressed my experience. Doubt I will return"
"4.0","The third floor is the place to be. As long as it's not raining or the movable roof is broken. Then it gets a little hot up there on the rooftop. Both of those things happened to me during recent visits but I will say that it didn't stop me giving this place a four star review for their happy hour.Their appetizers are half off and they have $5 drinks. This is an awesome deal for downtown happy hour and the atmosphere on the third floor is actually beautiful. We recently had a work happy hour here and it was awesome. Other than the roof not working. But we may do and got tables closer to the opening.They do not have reservations for the third floor so it's just come one come all. But there is a lot of seating so it shouldn't be an issue to find a c or to find a place to set your drink if you do have to stand around a table. And the tables are pretty long so just pull up next to someone and make a new friend.My favorite drink is a frozen rose there. It is refreshing especially on a hot summer day. And it is part of the $5 happy hour special so really you can't go wrong. My favorite snack is the carrot hummus with arugula pesto. I know it sounds super weird but honestly it is delicious and I keep on suggesting it to everyone including the people who are sharing our table not part of our group. The pretzels with the governmental cheese are definitely the second favorite on the list. The cajun fries are always going to be a favorite because fries are delicious and a little bit of spice is awesome. I didn't think like the brie as much as I wanted to or the artichoke crab dip. But I will say that on the Brie I did like the the fruit.If you are downtown and want something interesting and different go and have a few drinks and appetizers on a rooftop bar. It is fun and a good way to pass some time after a long day of work."
"5.0","My friends and I looove coming here. Whether for happy hour or after dinner drinks. We've done birthdays and other celebrations here as well and ALWAYS have a wonderful time. One time there was a totally creepy dude we caught trying to take pics of us and the security team (Dan, Christina, and Cody) took AMAZING care of us. They kept an eye on us all night and even walked us out at the end of the night to make sure we made it home okay. I love coming here and I love the staff. Favorite  bar in Pittsburgh!"
"4.0","Delicious, unique, amazing hotcakes!!!! Crepe-like and thin, buttery, and exceptionally crispy edges. My first bite was to die for. They're really filling and really buttery so after awhile you feel a bit gross stuffing your face, but it's really, really, really good.I got the 'morning after breakfast' which is two eggs, a meat, and hotcakes. It was a perfect combo meal, and I ordered a side of the breakfast potatoes. The potatoes were greasy and not as crispy as I would have liked, but the breakfast overall was really good.Quick service, busy place, and delicious food!!! It's definitely worth waiting to try the hotcakes here!"
"5.0","You've got to get yourself down to Salem's. This place is hands down my favorite in the city for Indian/Middle Eastern food. The ambiance is cafeteria, as other reviewers have noted. However, the food more than makes up for the unassuming digs. If you are lucky enough to come down on the right day, you can get their saag paneer, which is creamy, tasty and full of paneer cheese. If not, do yourself a favor and order the shwarma (my husband's fave) or the chicken tikka. An interesting side note about this place- we originally heard about Salem's when we were discussing urban chicken rearing with a friend. This is one of the few places in the city limits that will process your chickens for you for a very reasonable price. What this means for you, the restaurant-goer, is that your meat is guaranteed VERY FRESH. Like, processed on the premises fresh.Also, if you have extra time, check out their market. They have an excellent selection of meats, as well as a great array of middle eastern spices, fruits, candies, and so on. Check out their Ramadaan break-fast meals in the evening around August-October - it's basically an all-you-can-eat meat buffet for under 20$/person.I've taken pretty much all of my extended family here at one point or another, and everyone has loved it! You have to be a bit adventurous, and don't come here dressed to the nines on your way down to a play or evening downtown - you'll definitely get some weird looks."
"3.0","I've been to Sausalido several times over the past few years but have never written a review. We decided to go for restaurant week. The menu on the restaurant week website looked good. Two appetizer choices, a salad, and two entree choices for $25.14 including a corkage fee (BYOB). Hubs went with the restaurant week menu. In the mood for pasta, I went with the bolognese. The server brought over bread with their white bean/balsamic spread. Very yummy, as always. We started with the quinoa meat(less)balls which was easily the star of the show. Anytime a healthy ingredient like quinoa is transformed into something so delicious that I can't even tell it's healthy, that's a homerun in the food world. Quinoa, cheese and marinara sauce, who would have thought? The next course was a salad with their white balsamic dressing. A standard salad topped off with blackberries, a nice surprise.  My bolognese arrived soon after the salad was cleared. Unfortunately, this is where the meal went downhill. The pasta was tender but the sauce lacked flavor for me. Although meaty, I was hoping for a more of a tomato base. I ended up taking most of it home for hubs who really enjoyed his risotto with bacon, arugula and blue cheese.  The service was also lacking. At the beginning of the meal we spent a significant amount of time looking around and waiting to order. When asking questions about the menu we were given either  a short answer or said he didn't know because he never tried it. Overall, some parts of our experience were fantastic while others were lacking."
"4.0","Arrived about 8:30am on a Saturday. It was early and still fairly empty. You order first downstairs and then you're given a table number where your food will be delivered. We sat upstairs outside on the balcony.Ordered the coffee, a half order of French toast, the ricotta pancakes, and home-fries. Also tried the rosemary walnut scone, pecan bar, and the oil cake. Everyones food arrived to the table hot, and all of the pastries were wonderful. The coffee was strong and hot. Coffee and water are self serve. The only con is the where and the way you order your food. There's a counter with the menu posted on the wall not very far from the entrance. There are people waiting behind you while you order, and it makes ordering fairly tense. The door to get to the steps to go upstairs is right at the front entrance near the counter. By the time we left, the line was out the door and you have to be careful not to hit the people waiting in line with the door. Overall it the food and the service after we were seated  was good. If I'm in the strip district again, I'd definitely go back."
"3.0","My colleagues and I chose to dine in super late after a long day of meetings. Nonetheless, the service was exceptional. The food however was just ok. I ordered scallops which were not served hot. I also got potato and leak soup, which was different than expected (no chunks of potatoes, all pur√®ed). On top of that we had several different appetizers at the table, but none stood out. Overall, I feel like the meal was overpriced for what I received."
"5.0","Love Nata! Last day in Pittsburgh for this term. Online order is really convenient. Good place to enjoy your breakfast and try new style of breakfast. I ordered Nata and the Ezgg&Cheese in Azorean Speciality Breakfast Category. Portugal roll was so soft and tasty, blending with medium eggs and melting cheese. Recommend!"
"1.0","Members of our party said tap water was fine. Told the filter was broken and that if they give us tap that we could get sick. Gave us the option of the smallest water bottle for 50 cents or a bacterial infection. Their words not mine. Member in our party was given coffee with flakes in it. Asked for a new cup. While up their he asked how they made their coffee. It's was with the tap. They also filled up a bowl for a dog with tap water. Nice gesture but isn't that dog going to get sick? Some of our food was tasteless. Some was really good. Not worth the $70 we spent for 6 people. Would have rather of gotten fast food for $20I fully understand the 50 cent bottles over not wanting to give out free water. Totally a cash grab. I would be ok with it too if they were honest about it. They either lied to us about the tap water or got a dog and everyone drinking coffee sick. Either way I don't support going here"

"4.0","**This review is for their food truck**This is probably the best thing on four wheels. They offered about 5 different tacos and a few other items such as beans, nachos and walking tacos. I ordered 2 carnitas and 1 chicken on corn tortillas. They were $4 and very filling. I would've liked the corn tortillas to have been a little crispier but that's just my preference. They were still delicious! The guac on the chicken taco was so fresh and garlicky. And the cilantro and cojita (I think??) on top of all of them just really made them amazing. The meats were smoky and tender and a little juicy. If you see this rolling by, follow it and get some tacos!"

"4.0","Dined here Saturday 8/6 for an early dinner. The wings were top notch. I got them plain, but asked for three sauces on the side: redbeard's signature sauce, jalape√±o and cheese sauce, and a Horsey sauce that was the surprisingly best sauce.Our server Cindy was perfect. She recommended the Horsey sauce and although I was skeptical about it at first, I was glad to have tried it. I also got an order of the nachos (pulled pork). While decent, the chips were salty AF. There is no question that I will return for more wings next time I need to eat downtown."
"2.0","We went to this establishment because they said they'd change the tv to the World Cup. Everyone was excited about this... This isn't just our table but the other tables on our side of the restaurant. Joe (the manager) decides to walk over and change the game. His reason being ithat there was a Pirates game on. Someone just asked for the World Cup as I'm writing this and they said they were threatened with being written up if they changed the game.Joe is a jerk and wouldn't even compromise or anything. One star. Our waitress Sydney is awesome. Joe is awful just plain awful.Update: Dustin came in and changed the TV back to Fifa World Cup. He's awesome.. It only took 30 extra minutes of missing the game because of Joes selfish, unreasonable decision.   I'm giving this place a two star now instead of one.  Thanks Dustin."
"1.0","Great beer!! The service was terrible. Asked for a booth and was told it was for 'paying customers' which my group was. We were there at 930PM and we blown away by the little service they cared to provide."
"1.0","This is the worst service that I have ever received from any restaurant.  Slow service - poor methods of payment - lost my credit card and eventually they found it. Peace - we done Jerome Bettis Grille."
"4.0","After coming to Umami three times and not being able to get a seat, I finally learned my lesson and reserved a table -- this spot is popular! The atmosphere for this place is everything a millennial dreams of. The DJ is always playing amazing music, while the interior is decorated oh so 'Instagram worthy.'  I was pleasantly surprised by the price of this place. It's also very affordable during happy hour! The sashimi was fresh and cut into pieces that weren't too thin or too thick. This was my first time trying scallop sushi. Where has this been all my life?! The Hokkaido scallops was a huge mouthful of soft buttery goodness. One of my favorites! Besides sushi, we got the okonomiyaki and wagyu beef. It was also my first time trying okonomiyaki and it was DELICIOUS. Very filling topped off with okonomiyaki sauce and Japanese mayo. The wagyu beef was a disappointment however. We were surprised by the price when we saw it on the menu, but it turned out to be four pieces on a skewer and burnt. Honestly tasted like something my dad would burn at a church barbecue. Lastly, we got the fried matcha ice cream for dessert. It was very interesting and would be great for someone with a huge sweet tooth. The toppings were very mysterious to me and was basically sugar styrofoam. Besides the wagyu and the ice cream, everything was delicious. The drinks were also strong yet bet drinkable and pretty!"
"5.0","This is my first time eating at Freshii. I chose to get my lunch through takeout and it was ready before I even arrived which is very nice especially at busy lunch hour. I ordered the Teriyaki Twist bowl and it was delicious and exactly as I ordered it! I will definitely be returning!"
"5.0","Man, I don't get how so many people down this place. I've never had anything but great experiences, whether ordering for delivery or going in.Their pies are the best that I have tasted in Pittsburgh (so far). So many other joints I have tried mess up the crust, which once you've screwed up the base you've got nothing else. But their pizza crust is thick and chewy, just the way I like it.I love how they load their pizzas up with toppings (another thing that some pizza places skimp on, which makes for an angry Quay!). Everything tastes fresh and incredibly flavorful.We ordered in from Genoa's on the nights where we really don't feel like cooking. They were a godsend when we were in the process of moving. We've always managed to get our food delivered well before the quoted time, piping hot, and the delivery guys and the guys who take our order are always pleasant."
"1.0","I waited an hour for a pizza for them to say there was a mixup with the delivery. They said they would send me a fresh one asap only to take 40 mins. One hour and 40 minutes for a pizza and I asked the delivery driver to ask his boss for it to be on them. Boss said no. Terrible customer service. Pizza looked good but didn't get to taste it."
"5.0","I wandered in here after bar hopping. The food was so amazing, I decided that I had to come back when I was sober to make an actual judgement on if it was as delicious as I thought it was.It was.This quickly became one of my favorite places to grab food on East Carson. I honestly think this taco place beats out the famed Las Palmas, in Oakland, as well as Reyna's in the Strip. The tacos offered here may not be as 'authentic', but the fusion of American and Mexican in a no-nonsense way is kind of really amazing. I think I've tried every taco offered, and they're all good. However, my favorites are the pork tacos, and the chicken nachos. The prices are extremely reasonable ($3 a taco, $5 for nachos), and they take cards! They also serve soda in glass bottles, which is nice. The place is open late on weekends, making it the perfect drunk munchie sort of place."
"5.0","I've never had a single hint of a problem with these guys (and gals). The food is always delicious, the fries are amazing, the prices are reasonable for the area, and everything works together like a charm.I typically go with the Porkgasm, the Pinkman, The Sloppy Top, or the PGH Cheesesteak, but all their salads and other options are delicious as well. If you're looking for great food served with a laid-back, yet obviously attentive attitude, hit this place up.Not to mention, they have a healthy respect for all things Lionel Richie, which can only be a bonus in my book."
"4.0","corned beef hash: none. however, they do have high quality, unique breakfast and lunch sandwiches. they serve non-pittsburgh fries -- not fresh cut, sans skin -- tossed in some delicious salt mixture."
"1.0","Week. We put money in the juke box and allegedly the owner shut it off because a retro basketball game was on."
"5.0","I stopped into Redbeards for a few beers before dinner recently. I was overwhelmed with how great this place is!  They had excellent beer specials and extremely classy decor.  I'd like to give a special shout out to Kourtney, Who took care of everything I needed. Everything.  They have quite a few TVs, I think this place would be great to watch games at on the weekends.  Overall: great place to have a few!"
"4.0","Such a pleasant surprise.  Recommended to us by Indian friends as the best in Pittsburgh.  Authentic South Indian cuisine, great deals!!! nice service, strong flavors, very fresh.  Even love the wall art!  Second visit just as satisfying as the first.  We'll be back for more dosas/ sambar/ coconut chutney soon.  Thank you Tamarind."
"5.0","My family lives on the South SIde of Pittsburgh so we find ourselves ordering out quite often.  You know I've come to not really expect much from these pizza joints.  Like warm food and maybe 3/4 of my order correct.  However we've ordered from this place about 5 times so far over the past 6 months.   Their customer service on the phone is 100%.  They are always so polite to me when I call.  And trust me sometimes I have a fussy newborn and/or a 7 year old who changes what she wants a few times when I am ordering.  But each time they are so patient and they even suggest things to me.  We are now hooked on their Spinach and Feta Pie.  This time we ordered that Pie and a Six Cheese Pie.  Oh and we cant forget the Steak Deluxe Hoagie.  Everything is just so yummy!  The ingredients they use are fresh.  And each item has so many flavors not just your bland tasting pizza.  The pizza came to my door in under an hour!  Also the pizza guy was extemely nice when he got here too.  He was a cute one too ladies! hahah ;)  So my experience with them as usual is awesome.  I probably should call them and tell them how much I appreciate their food and customer service.    I guess the only negative thing I can think of is their pricing.  Gourmet Pizza sm. $10.99, med. $14.99, large $17.99, ex Large $19.99.  But honestly I dont care to pay more if the quality is there too!  YUMMMMMMMMMMMY"
"5.0","Had the Ahi Tuna for lunch on a salad with the Lemon Ginger dressing...seriously the best salad dressing I've ever had!!!"
"5.0","OMG I feel so missed out for waiting so long to try the restaurant out. I've been hearing so many good things about this place and I finally get to try it out. It is AMAZING! I love it. The best fish is the chili chicken, of course who doesn't love it, I think that is everybody's favorite. I always get the mix plate, you will 2 choice of meat and 1 vege of your choice of rice. The portion is huge, defiantly enough to share. I always get the chili chicken and change the other meat choice, I've got the lamb, curry, the pink chicken(I forgot the name), chili chicken is still my favorite. Maybe next time I will just get 2 chili chicken instead? Haha The other thing we usually get is the shawarma, it is kinda like gyro, also taste great and huge portion. The line is always long and try to order on the iPad to avoid the line. Defiantly recommend anyone to go!!"
"3.0","For those who remember, the previous occupant of this space was Eclipse.  Cinderlands has transformed the space in a very appealing manner.  The bar area is nicely done and the back room has an impressive mural.  To start, we tried a couple of the beers.  They were good but nothing really stood out.  On to appetizers....The perogies were exceptional.  The mustard  creme fraiche really made the dish.  The brussels sprouts were also an interesting dish.  The addition of the pomegranate really changed the flavor in a good way.The red lentil falafel was rather disappointing.  Just bland.  No flavor here.  I could not finish it.  The fries on the other hand were way too salty. My friends had the burger and seemed to like it."
"5.0","This place makes me feel like I'm in NYC.  The outside and ambiance aren't anything special or spectacular but the food is unbelievably good.  I strongly recommend the Thai Style Fried Rice.  The yellow curry and cashew tofu were also very tasty.I normally don't review places that have over 20 reviews but I figured I had to give a shout out to the vegans / vegetarians.  The tofu is really tasty and if you order the fried rice with tofu they automatically leave out the egg.  Lots of other options available for vegans.  The parking is street only.  Credit Cards are accepted.  Good place to bring a date or a group of friends for a casual yet tasty meal."
"2.0","My boyfriend and I were excited to try this place since it's so close to our apartment and have gone a couple times now. Unfortunately, it's just ok, nothing great. It probably won't become a regular spot we check out very often.Our first visit was during their soft opening, my boyfriend had a basic double cheeseburger and fries. I had the Mexican War burger without the chilies and paid the $1 extra for the rosemary fries. We split a chocolate milkshake. The milkshake was made with Millie's ice cream, which was the selling point. However it was kind of poorly made, it looked kind of like the blender was broken, it was kind of just mushed up ice cream with some milk added to it. It was thick in parts, but then super soupy in other parts. We decided it wasn't a big deal since it was their soft opening, it was still decent just because it was made with Mille's ice cream. My boyfriends double burger was huge, despite the pattys being a little thinner than some other places around town. He said that the burger itself was very salty though. My burger was ok, but nothing super great. I felt like that patty was a little thinner than I was used to. It's honestly hard to compete as a burger joint in the city now when there are already some places doing REALLY good burgers. (Burgatory, Smoke's Burger night, The Vandal, etc) I wouldn't pay $1 extra for the rosemary fries again, they were literally just the same fries my boyfriend got with rosemary flakes sprinkled on them. There were a couple other items on the menu we wanted to try, and it was only their soft opening so we decided we'd be back.On our second visit, the service was kind of slow. We waited close to 20 min before someone came over to us to ask for our drink orders. When we did get to order, both of us got chicken sandwiches. My boyfriend got a simple grilled chicken sandwich and I got their fried chicken sandwich. He got fries again, I asked for mac & cheese but they were out, so I got a side salad. Since they were out of mac and cheese we decided to try the fried goat cheese bites as an app, I love goat cheese! The goat cheese bites were $9 for 4 little bites, which is a little on the pricer side in my opinion, especially because they weren't that good. When I bit into them they were mostly hollow with some goat cheese attached to the breading on the inside (think a mozzarella stick that the cheese has slipped out of). I only had 1 bite that had much cheese in it. The goat cheese is also herbed goat cheese, which isn't explained on the menu. My boyfriend said his grilled chicken was salty again and it was pickle brined as well, which isn't explained on the menu. He doesn't like pickles. My fried chicken sandwich HUGE, but it was just ok taste-wise, the breading kept slipping off as some other reviewers mentioned. The side salad was ok, the ranch dressing seemed like it was missing something. Overall we found this place to be kind of mediocre so we unfortunately probably won't be back much."
"5.0","I haven't even gotten my food and I already love this place.  The strip is super busy and we lucked by this place at 10:30AM on a Sunday.  All eight of us very hungry.  Thanks to a very nice gentleman already sitting at a table who offered to move, they were able to seat us together.  Most would find the menu delightful, unless you are an 11 year old who just wants cereal.  Nevermind that... that is my personal little crisis (she got toast - wheat as no white was available - and milk; she'll be fine). The food is gorgeous.  The blueberry ricotta pancakes were no less than divine.  Staff super friendly and attentive.  Many places in the district were way busier than this and I have no idea why.  This place is a must.  So glad I made this local place a part of my out of town experience.  Oh and that 11 year old.  Yeah, she loved my pancakes, too."
"3.0","A trendy Japanese spot with many different options from sushi to ramen/noodle dishes to seafood to other izakaya dishes. We got takoyaki, a grilled fish special, udon noodles, and a savory egg custard. All were good, though the fish was very underwhelming and not that tasty for the $18 that it cost - it was accurate in the description given by our server, but we were hoping for more of a miso cod style dish (which is not on this menu - I hope they add it!)Note that if you go during dinnertime, you'll be surrounded by red lighting. Not ideal for food pornos."
"5.0","Very positive and nice ambiance. Caner and the rest of the crew are very friendly.  The menu has a wide variety of crepes and omelettes. Mediterranean omelette is particularly my favorite. I tried pesto as for the crepes, and num num and berries for the desert. I enjoyed all the food I had  each time. I would recommend this place for having pleasant time, thanks to the very friendly staff. Keep up the good work guys!!!"
"5.0","A friend introduced me to this spot and i am not lying when I say this place has the best tacos I've ever had!! Super welcoming staff and ALWAYS serving food on point! I will give this place my business any day of the week!"
"4.0","I drive past this restaurant everyday on my way to work and we finally had a chance to try their burgers.  As it says on their website they take pride in their craft burgers and beer.  We were expecting that with their burgers but we didn't know they brew their own beer too.  That was a pleasant surprise.       We walked in on a Saturday evening and it was busy but we got a table for two.  We wanted to go to the bar but it was full.  We waited at our table for five minutes and nobody stopped by to get us drinks or to greet us.  We saw some spots open at the bar so we just left our table and sat at the bar.  They were busy but somebody still could have greeted us.  The bar was much better.  There was a TV and the bartender was good.  He was busy but we got service.  He told us about their beer and we got to look over the menu's.  I went with Maggie's farm burger cooked medium.  My wife ordered the Animal.        The beer that we ordered was a New England Ipa and it was good.  That night they were on special for $4 which was great.  You rarely see something like that.  Our food came out and I really enjoyed my burger.  It wasn't a big burger like I was thinking it would be but it still was a good size.  My wife didn't like her burger as much.  It came with cream cheese on it like she wanted but it was a huge slab.  It should have been thinner and probably more melted because it came cold.  The meat was good just need to fix the dressing I'd say on the whole burger.  I didn't ask for lettuce and tomatoes but it probably could have used that. Overall we had a good time here and I would come back.  I do recommend trying this place if you want a good burger and really good local craft beer."
"4.0","Had lunch today July 4. Everything was presented nicely and tasty. If not overpriced but that seems to be the trend in the strip District. This place has a warehouse decor acoustics are pretty bad music is pretty bad I think you're trying to be too many things either sports bar or a seafood restaurant. They should pick one and stick with it. Nothing was really terrible but the large warehouse atmosphere leaves a bit to be desired as it's pretty noisy and then the music added to the noise"
"4.0","This is one of my favorite places to go for a nice drink - with both local friends but especially out of towerners. The Summit features a diverse and rotating draft list, and extensive catalog of bottles and superb cocktails. Prices are standard and they have plenty of table games, which makes the atmosphere lively. They recently added a food menu, with offerings a little more up scale then I was expecting. Highly recommended."
"3.0","My husband and I dined at Sausalido with friends and everyone was pretty disappointed with their meals. As an appetizer, we ordered the baked gouda, which was breaded (?) and not very tasty.  I ordered the evening fish special, which was bland even after I spread the accompanying curry butter on it.  My husband ordered a different fish, which was heavily battered, though not described as such by the waiter.   On the bright side, my meal was relatively healthy and Sausalido does permit corking.  Aside from the intimate atmosphere, there isn't any reason I would return."
"5.0","In my opinion TCG is the best of all the upscale steakhouses in Pittsburgh. The waiters and waitresses are professional, super friendly, and know everything about the food they are serving you, as they should. Their assistants are also very professional and attentive, You'll never ask for a refill of water. The atmosphere is dark and sexy, many beautiful paintings hang on the walls. Best steaks you can get in Pittsburgh, hands down. I recommend the filet, gorgonzola and truffle crusted with cabernet reduction. The lobster mac and cheese is sinfully rich and filled with huge chunks of lobster. The truffle fries are as addicting as crack cocaine and the lobster bisque is perfect. One of my favorite restaurants in any city."
"3.0","First time there..I had the cod with the mashed potatoes..I was very disappointed, no flavor to the cod or the potatoes..I also had the lobster bisque, now that was very good! My husband had the blackened sword fish that was delicious, but he also had the garlic mashed potatoes and they had no taste."
"5.0","I really enjoyed Cinderlands Beer! The atmosphere and workers were all very respectful and helpful! I loved the beer as well...highly recommend."
"4.0","I was very impressed with the food at this joint. The only reason I give 4 stars is because you have to walk up so many stairs to get there, so that means it is not handicap accessible, and you could potentially sweat out your look before even getting to the restaurant. It has a cool hipster vibe and the music is awesome. Was there for happy hour. The food presentation is beautiful and the craft cocktails were delicious. The deviled eggs were sooo good!"
"4.0","Cafe Raymond was great stopped for breakfast. Cafe was clean and the employees were very nice and helpful when ordering. Food was good would like to go back to try lunch options as well. The blue berry ricotta pancakes were wonderful light fluffy and flavorful must try!"
"3.0","A decent lunch spot. Service is friendly though a tad slow even if the place isn't busy.The pizza is average at best. It comes out hot, the crust isn't that crisp and as another reviewer said, it lacks flavor. I've also had the fish sandwich which was good; a decent-sized piece of fish that's not greasy. The french fries are pretty good."
"4.0","Lovely warm place and nice staff. Beef corned potatoes are very good. I have been their twice and still want to go again. ONLY CASH IS ACCEPTED"
"1.0","The worst food I ever had in Pittsburgh. I tried it the first time after seeing positive reviews of it for a very long time. But it was pathetic! I ordered Samosa chaat which had Potato and Green peppers. Who puts peppers in a chaat? Looks like he used leftovers to make chaat. Second thing I ordered was veg biryani which was stale. I threw up almost 4 time after having that last night. Pathetic food. I would have given -5 if there was an option. Health loss + $20 wasted!"
"4.0","I am so happy to be able to write a good review for a locally-owned higher end restaurant.  I ate here last night with my boyfriend and thoroughly enjoyed my meal and experience.  When we walked in there was only one other table of guests there (which worries me somewhat) but I am going to start telling people to go there so hopefully that will change!I ordered the mushroom ravioli with caesar salad as my starter.  My boyfriend ordered the salmon with the beet salad as his starter.  We brought a bottle of wine and I was happy that our corkage fee was a reasonable price ($4).  We both really enjoyed our meals.  I also really liked our waitress, who was very attentive and friendly.  The atmosphere is fine: not great, but not bad.  I would say there were a few too many fake flowers for my liking but honestly it didn't overly detract from the dining experience. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal and will definitely be back again!  We just need to start getting more people here to ensure its success!"
"5.0","One of the better Indian restaurants in the Pittsburgh area. My experience at Tamarind was great. All of the food was very fresh and flavorful. The restaurant is nestled in a cute house in Oakland and the inside has pretty decor. Our server was friendly and gave us many recommendations for what to try. For appetizers, my dad and I split the ethnic sampler which comes with fried hot chili peppers, samosas, and vegetable pakora. We also got the lentil patties. The fried hot chili peppers were amazing, because they had a tiny bit of heat to them! The samosas were flaky and crispy, and they weren't dry. The lentil patties were served with various sauces that each had a unique flavor to them. For the main course, I had the lamb vindaloo which was so yummy. The vindaloo sauce was almost like a thick tomato sauce with some spice to it. It was a generous portion that came with vegetable daal and basmati rice. Also, the entree came with garlic naan, which definitely hit the spot. The naan was soft and chewy and had the perfect amount of garlic. I want to come back to Tamarind, because everything was outstanding and satisfied my Indian food craving :) I would highly recommend."
"1.0","Terrible service. Ordered a late night pizza and told 45 minutes. Driver calls close to 90 minutes later with lame excuse about getting sent the other direction and still 7-8 minutes away. Called the restaurant to request 50% off and no deal. Then, after asking who the owner is so I can lodge a complaint I'm told by someone with an accent that they don't know, call back tomorrow and after asking several times I was hung up on, twice. I was assertive, and angry, but no cursing or yelling. Terrible, terrible, terrible!!! Hopefully with my Hilton status I can have them removed from the hotel's recommended listing. I would not give this place any business if your counting on them, unreliable to a fault."
"3.0","I was in the mood for Chinese food and it was limited to what was opened after 10 pm on a Friday night in Oakland and downtown Pittsburgh so I decided to try Chinatown Inn.  I got the mixed wonton soup which has wonton, noodles, broth, snap peas, water chestnuts, bok choy, Shrimp, and Chicken, it was very tasty.  The second thing I got was the all white meat general tso chicken and it was ok, the thing that was different is that there was pineapple in it and the sauce wasn't even really spicy  like it normally would be it was a toss between sweet and sour chicken and general tso chicken.  I can't really say much about the service but it was fast and efficient because I placed my order to go."
"5.0","I've heard sooo many good things about this place and when my friend suggested it, I could not say no.We got the chicken tikka masala combo with a side of spinach. Both were so freaking delicious and they give you SO MUCH FOOD! Like they're literally packing the container with rice and just drenching it in sauce and I loved every moment and bite of it.We each got a chicken and a beef samosa which are heated up fresh and are packed with meat. Even better than the samosa is the white sauce that they give you. There's like a hint of garlic to it and it's just phenomenal.The photos don't look to appetizing but this place is definitely worth it, I swear. It's a must if you're looking for a casual dining option in the strip."
"4.0","Stayed down the street and found this place on Yelp & gave it a shot. Friendly folks, quick service & tasty tacos. I got the Americano, Pollo & pulled pork tacos & all the meat was flavorful. Pollo probably was my favorite & the toppings were fresh. Loved that they were only $3 apiece, so we grabbed & went. Good stuff."
"4.0","service was great. staff was really friendly and the owner was very out and about. the home fries that came with the sandwich were good. the steak sandwich itself was ok. the meat may not have been cut right so it was hard to bite of a piece and it was super chewy and pretty tough. would probably not get the same dish and try something different when i go back. atmosphere/space was really nice. good amount of seating and the area in between the kitchen and bathroom is a great little area with the big table and tv."
"4.0","I hate going to Oakland, but I've been finding great little gems, and this place is one of them. The restaurant is in what looks like an old home. The area that's converted into the dining space isn't very large, but it's cozy. We were seated promptly and given water and menus. The waiter never asked if we wanted anything else to drink but water sufficed. The menu has plenty of choices without being overwhelming and there is something for everyone. We had plenty of time to look it over, actually a little too much time, it took a while to snag someone's attention to take our orders. Our food came in a decent time and was a good portion. I ordered chicken korma, it was mild and probably a new favorite dish! I loved the flavors. My boyfriend ordered the chilly chicken and said it was incredibly spicy but he was equally as satisfied with his choice. We will absolutely be back for another meal soon!"
"1.0","Met a group of people on a weekday late afternoon.   People in our group kept coming and going for a few hours, all buying drinks as we stood near the bar. About every 5 minutes one of the waiters would start harassing us because someone had either set a drink or laid a coat on one of the unoccupied tables or its chairs next to the bar.  He kept saying he needed those tables for people that may come in for food.  There's about 10 tables. Two had people at them. He never came close to needing the table.  Yet he harassed us for the 2 hours we were there."
"5.0","This was the best arepa I have ever had! It was fresh and delicious. The staff were friendly and the place was nice and clean. I wish I lived close to Pittsburgh. I would eat here regularly!"
"5.0","All I really have to say is...this place is AMAZING. Classic ambiance, Delicious food, fantastic service, potent wine and dreamy dessert. The food at the capital grill is well worth the price. I ordered the balsamic wagyu burger. It was heavenly. I decided to have it served medium and this was the perfect choice.  It was so savory and juicy. I also elected to have the truffle oil fries. OH MY GOD. I think they were the best fries I've ever had in my entire life. For dessert, I ordered the cheesecake. The cook fired the top to give it a small crunch. I'm not a huge dessert fan, so I don't think I really appreciated the time it took to create such a beautiful dish, so I'll include a photograph. I don't think I've ever been in a restaurant that has made me want to come back the very next day, so props to the capital grill!"
"4.0","This place was highly recommended by a family member so after a trip to the incline, we came here for dinner. The atmosphere was great. Not to stereotype, but when i see asians dining in an Asian restaurant, it tends to put me more at ease about the food. Instead of looking through the menu, I went the lazy route and got the Lovers plate for two. The place was fairly packed for a Sunday evening, so the sushi chef was a bit backed up. Our waiter was one of the best ive ever had. If I remember his name, i'll be sure to update and post here to give him kudos. I use to work restaurant so i was patient for our food, I peeked around to check out other people order, and i saw the dessert that was brought out to our neighboring table and I told myself that I must have it too! the sushi was fair and the both of us were stuffed.Still, I MUST have the dessert, so we got the fried ice cream.  It was on a plate with red bean sauce, 2 oranges, and 2 c antelope slices. YuMM! Theres still much more that I want, so i will def come back to try the other desserts. and hopefully, request the same waiter!"
"5.0","I can't say anything about the food here other than the sushi. I come for sushi and nothing else. This is one of the very few places around that even has rice at the proper temperature. The rice is also beautifully balanced between sweet and vinegar flavors. The sushi chefs are observant -- they watch how you eat and how you respond and tailor the sushi to your habits. For example, if you dip the fish side into the soy sauce instead of dunking the rice, they will form the rice loosely so that it dissolves in your mouth. Ahhh!Ask the sushi chef what is good that day and follow his advice! Service otherwise is friendly and unobtrusive."
"4.0","I have eaten here many times. The food is really good but a little too pricey for what you get. Their wedding soup is delicious and I have enjoyed most of their soups of the day. The house salad is my favorite with the candied nuts... very delicious. I've had a few of the pastas and sandwiches. Like I said, it's pretty expensive but the food is pretty good."
"5.0","The people that gave this place four or less stars are fucking idiots, easily the best fried chicken sandwich I've ever had.  They should give the option to add bacon though"
"4.0","Great taco restaurant on Southside. Their ingredients always taste fresh, and everything goes together very well. Prices since this review are $3/taco. All of their tacos are phenomenal (beef, pork, chicken, never tasted vegetarian). Nachos are decent, but I think their strength lies in their main course. They offer corn or flour tortilla which can be grilled to perfection. The only gripe I have is that their seating is very limited to about 10-12, and they can get super busy!"
"5.0","I want to give a shout out to George our waiter at Jerome Bettis' Grille!  He made my lunch with my niece that was having her birthday today very special,not only did he come out with some delicious ice cream and sang Happy birthday to her but he also let us visit Jerome's personal mancave at the restaurant and let us take some pictures!  Thanks again George for helping me make this a day to remember for my little Bitsy!  Almost forgot the food was great too!  We Love the bus#36! Steeler fans for life!"
"2.0","Visiting from Florida and we didn't enjoy this restaurant. It requires cash only and the food was below average. Our table and chairs had food crumbs left on it when we were seated. Food came and it was pretty greasy and not flattering. Our server was just that 'a server'. Pancakes were so thin that it was pointless to try to cut. We won't be back and I believe ppl only go to this restaurant for the history ‚Äç."
"4.0","Awesome food -- affordable and oh-so delicious. My friend and I often make the trek from Murrysville to the strip just to indulge. One thing you can count on is people of all walks of life dining here: the  Pakistani women in elegant shalwar kameez and matching hijab, the recent migrant from Jordan, dressed in jeans and a t-shirt and hanging out with his buddies, and the Pittsburgh-area foodies who have been turned on to this place."
"5.0","Friendly service. Clean. Seated quickly. Great buffet and breakfast. Attentive waitress. Highly recommend."
"4.0","I came here for the french toast, but it was the 'cherry' egg white omelet that I devoured. The omelet and coffee are fantastic, the french toast, not so much! I ordered the berry french toast topped with goat cheese and whatever the berry sauce that was concocted to top the french toast was awful to me, it tasted like artificial science. Additionally, I don't like french toast that's topped with fried egg, I prefer dipped in batter french toast. The waitress was very pleasant and dutiful. Before I conclude, allow me to share an oddity, the waitress unprompted brought us two small bottled waters, and to our surprise, a cost for the same appeared on the bill. I would return because I love small businesses, and the coffee and omelet were great!"
"3.0","Stopped by for dinner after a night class. They were still quite busy for the time of evening and had only two people working, so it took awhile and a few tries for us to get menus and water. Since we had a groupon, we ordered off the menu versus having the buffet. It appeared that the dishes we ordered overlapped with the buffet offerings, as we felt the dishes may have come from the buffet line. However, the dishes we ordered (Saag Paneer, Biriyani, and garlic naan) were all still very tasty. We also got chai tea (which we saw did come from the buffet line) and a Rasmalai for dessert to share. Was a bit difficult to get the attention of an employee to refill water cups. The flavor or everything was quite good, however, it seemed almost a waste to order off the menu and pay more for what was included in the buffet."
"4.0","It has one of the best restaurant week menus. In summary, the food was decent and the indoor decor was classic, but we felt it was a little overpriced with the regular menu. I was expecting more carefully designed dishes, in the sense of more delicate flavors and more beautiful plates. However, it was a good deal  to come on restaurant week. Clam chowder: very creamy, thicker than others I've had. Bleu cheese salad: it was half a cabbage with salad sauce and some bleu cheese. It was fine. Nothing special.Filet Mignon: I had better and cheaper(in regular menu, it is almost 50) filet mignon before. It was soft but I felt they only use salt for the flavor. NY strip: Tasted similar as the filet mignon, but it was a little burnt outside.We liked the sides for the steak. The smashed potato was very creamy and buttery. Cheesecake: a little too soft. Chocolate cake: very bitter, I can tell it was made with pure dark chocolate."
"4.0","So far the best wings I've had on my short trip to Pittsburgh. If you love beer they have more than enough options on tap for you to indulge. Great vibe and of course all games present on multiple TVs across the venue"
"4.0","We've been here on several occasions, and the service is either great or so-so (never bad), but one thing is consistent: The 'Over 9,000 roll' is absolutely EPIC.Ever since we first tried this place, we always order the Over 9000 roll. Not just because it's REALLY FUN TO SAY. One of us ordered it that first visit, and now we can't stop in without getting it. Also noteworthy: The Shrimp Po Boy is a great comfort food option. Generously shrimped (I know that's not a real verb, nonetheless) and perfectly piled up with fresh toppings. Same goes for the Lobster Bisque Fries: Comfort Food for your inner Beach Bum.Any seafood you get here is delightfully fresh tasting and so perfect in texture... They always just blow the preparation out of the water! (Ha)Definitely a great go-to for a trip to the Strip!"
"5.0","Just got done with a tour of Heinz Field and we were looking for a bomb place to eat around the stadium and locals recommended Jerome's quite a few times. Coming from Cali on a red eye not even 12 hours ago we were starving so we made a decision and it was a great one. It is literally a 10min walk from the field and the menu is extensive. Lots of tvs were playing NCAAF and not bad pricing for the food which was very tasty. There are alot of signed plaques from athletes and celebrities as well as Steelers history glad we came in! #HereWeGo"
"4.0","Salem's is interesting.  It is a grocery store and cafeteria.  Styrofoam and plasticware.The food is very good and the portions are huge.  If you are a big eater, you are going to be stuffed.  If you are a smaller eater, you will be taking half your meal with you.Their tandoori chicken is amazing.  Their gyros are also good."
"4.0","Sushi cravings are inconvenient in Pittsburgh. I wanted a hand roll. So that limited my options. I decided to give Umami a try because I was truly in need of raw fish. AMBIENCE B-Yikes. I kept looking around to see if anyone looked liked they belonged in that strange atmosphere, and I can't say anyone did. We went on a weeknight without a reservation and were seated at the bar. I had a prime view of a glass display case of precut fish. The place had neon lights and an indoor grill that accommodated the few hot food items. The only other time I've been so bombarded by an Asian neon stereotype is when Hot for Chicken was open in Ktown. But that place billed itself as a hangout. This place was not that.SERVICE A-It was fine, the guy was nice enough but considering we were ordering small plates as we ate, he didn't come around quite enough and so dinner lasted forever.DRINKS A-I ordered the ginger ginger which was fine. Tasty and not too sweet. But it was tiny.APPETIZER A-I insisted on getting appetizers so we didn't have to declare bankruptcy from our sushi needs. So we got the takoyaki, which again, was fine. Are you starting to see a theme?MAIN COURSE A-There were multiple rounds of nigiri and a salmon hand roll, which set us back enough that I threatened to fly to LA next time I wanted sushi. The fish was fresh enough and a decent quality. The hand roll was as expected. Everything was...Fine.DESSERTI cannot for the life of me remember if I had dessert. So in conclusion, this satisfied my sushi cravings for a total of 48 hours, after which I found myself needing it again. Was it worth it? Maybe?"
"3.0","3.5 starsThe sister restaurant Savoring India is much better, but this place was pretty solid. We came on Sunday for a lunch buffet. I usually avoid buffets, but after an amazing buffet experience at Savoring India, I wanted to try Flavor of India. The service was quick and friendly. The food was good however extremely limited compared to Savoring India's buffet.I loved the eggplant pakora dish with fried chickpeas. The dosa was also crispy and delicious. The food was spicyyy which I LOVE. The price was right too ($10 for a lunch buffet). Compared to NYC where I live, the prices on the regular menu don't seem too bad but maybe it's steep compared to other places in PGH. My boyfriend was disappointed that there were no lamb dishes at the buffet which Savoring India had at theirs.I'll be back for sure to try other things on the menu."
"5.0","This restaurant is not in Carnegie it is in downtown pittsburgh- why say its in Carnegie Ill never know? But Ive eaten there and it is sooo goood like Chinatown in San Francisco! I lived in San Diego Ca & missed that food! This is sooo goood! I love the real chowmein not other places dont make it at all! EggRolls great! But remember this isnt In Carnegie!"
"4.0","Came by here on a Tuesday circa 8:30 am to place an order for take-out. The staff was very friendly and my food was ready within a few minutes."
"4.0","This was my second visit to BullDawg's. The first time I had the cheese steak. I would not recommend it. The cheese was not evenly spread. The second time was yesterday. I ordered the classic burger which is mushroom and provolone. I made a point to order it well done because I've noticed a lot of food trucks do not cook to well done. They said it would take an extra few minutes which I don't mind waiting for something to be well done. It was delicious!!!! I think they are a little pricey for a food truck. $11 for a burger and fries. But that wouldn't stop me from getting it again. I heard several people go up and order a veggie burger which they do not have on the menu. Note- they do have them in the back."
"5.0","I really enjoyed this place! Went last night for a couple of drinks hoping for a cool vibe and good cocktails.  That is exactly what I found.  I had a Moscow mule which was a little too citrusy for me-- but still good--I prefer a stronger ginger flavor-- and then a super delicious cucumber vodka drink off of the specialty menu. The smell of spiced cider infused this place. I think it is a great place with a good crowd. By good crowd I mean not too young or old and definitely not a hook up spot.  In the background old hip hop was playing... Tribe called quest... The fall decor was a nice touch too. I recommend as a place to catch up with friends or to go on a date. They even had board games in the corner!!!!"
"5.0","I had brunch here yesterday. I'd messaged them through Instagram on Saturday since I wasn't sure if there was outside seating available and I wanted to take my dogs. I'm one of those people. Turns out they have 2 caf√© tables. They thoughtfully reserved one for me and had a dog bowl of water ready for them. So kind. Staff is kind, attentive and eager to answer questions about all the selections. Had the French toast. It was delicious. Not soggy, like some places, but creamy texture. Perfect amount of cinnamon. It was served with island jam which tasted, to me, like fig, maybe with some berry mixed in, and maple syrup. Both the jam and syrup were served warm so they didn't adversely affect the French toast. I had the ginger plum tea to drink. It comes unsweetened and is so good that it doesn't need anything added. I'm coming back for lunch very soon because the sandwich all sound delicious. The gentleman at the other table had one of the breakfast sandwiches and he said they're great. He comes every weekend for one."
"4.0","Definitely don't come here if you're expecting traditional Moroccan dishes. However, if you're looking for a good sub on-the-go, would recommend this place. Other yelpers mentioned getting the Chicken Sharmola, and I'd have to echo their recommendation. The sub came in a good-sized portion - couldn't even finish the entire thing actually. The chicken was not dry at all, and was covered in just the right amount of dressing that gave it a delicious savory flavor that kept you coming back for more."
"5.0","This is as fresh as it gets! No freezer burn here like some other bakery's I have went to, la gourmandine claims fresh and they are on it! Great place great service fresh food!"
"4.0","A really nice brewery in Pittsburgh's hipster neighborhood, Lawrenceville. While I enjoy the beer at Cinderlands, the food actually steals the show for me! They have a fried chicken sandwich that is absolutely phenomenal. Overall a really nice location to grab dinner and a few drinks with friends and family. The missing 5th star is simply because there are many other breweries I prefer in Pittsburgh when it comes to beer selection and taste."
"4.0","Traveler ReviewFood (3.5/5) we ordered smoked salmon sandwich and blueberry ricotta pancakes. The sandwich had fresh produce and the salmon was good too, the pancake was delicious make sure you pour a generous amount of honey on top. Coffee was not good.Service (4/5) - we went for Saturday brunch and the food was out in less than 10 minutes. They have a ton of tables on the top floor. It is kid friendly with capacity to host large groups.Took a star for the bad coffee."
"4.0","I haven't try any indian food before. This restaurant refresh my thought on Indian food. They are great. The narr is a must-try. The sauce of the entree is delicious. Eat the sauce with narr. One thing you need to note is that the meal comes out quite slow. Maybe i came quite early at that time."
"4.0","Good variety of food for seafood and non-seafood lovers alike. Lobster bisque was amazing, I could've ordered just a bowl of that. Also tried the crab cakes which were satisfying. Fianc√©e had the kitchen sink sushi which was a good variety. For a cocktail I had a pear martini which tasted amazing! Daughter had grilled cheese and fries and she enjoyed it."
"4.0","Yummy Thai food in a very casual atmosphere.  The eating area is very small, but takeout is quick and easy. I keep going back for more because it's so darn delicious!"
"4.0","** Pretty good tasting tacos but portions are on the smaller side and the chicken tastes salty. Still prefer Las Palmas in Oakland in my personal opinion, but worth the shot.Went here for my friends 21st birthday, and I ordered two beef tacos and one chicken, all on flour tortillas. The added guac on the chicken taco definitely caught my eye (as a true California native), and it definitely packed a punch. I do have to say however, that the chicken was pretty salty, and overall I left feeling pretty thirsty. The meat was pretty good as well.I do have to say that the portions are a bit of a setback. I paid $9 for three tacos, and didn't think it was enough for a whole meal. Luckily, I went to Benny Fierro's for some jumba pizza slices after for that bang bang (a term I learned from another Yelp eliter - funny reacts if you get the reference). This place is technically a sit down place but you can also get the tacos to go. Seating however is very limited as it is a small restaurant. Personally I like the fact that you can do your own add ons for salsa, cilantro, etc. at Las Palmas, and I definitely think I am a lot more full after eating Las Palmas. However, Doce offers inside seating which Las Palmas doesn't have, and hasn't been shut down for having sanitary issues."
"5.0","Great food! Really loved the brisket hash! That was delish. It was a little different to stand in line, order, then sit down. Definitely worth it. Wife's blueberry ricotta pancakes were very good too."
"4.0","I randomly stopped here while passing through Oakland. I noticed it was a new place and heard pretty good things about it. I ordered the kabob panini and it was pretty good! The portion size was just okay for the price, but it did come with fries. The sandwich was hot and fresh. The fries were well-seasoned. The service was good and the restaurant was relatively clean for a south Oakland establishment lol. I'll definitely return to try their pizza."
"4.0","My sister had recommended checking out Umami so my boyfriend and I decided to go for a date night. It's tucked away behind Round Corner Cantina, I never even noticed it was there. It's up two flights of stairs and the vibe is super trendy. We were told there would be at least a 45 minute wait since we didn't have reservations but then got seated quite quickly at the 'kitchen bar.' My one suggestion would be for the staff to ask guests if it's their first time so that they could explain the menu. We told them it was our first time and she said the style is order as you go and the food comes out very quickly. She also explained the menu to us. We started by ordering Waygu beef skewers and a sushi bowl. The skewer was delicious! I wasn't crazy about the sushi bowl but was happy to try something new, as it was straight raw fish rather than sushi rolls. We ended with the pork gyozo dumplings which were so tasty. I was so impressed. I would recommend trying this place for a new experience and next time will try one of the ramen bowls."
"3.0","I wanted to give more of an explanation of this place so that someone can make a better decision to try it or not (their site doesnt fully explain).This is a fast food restaurant, but slightly nicer than the normal (more like a Chipotle or 5 Guys). You stand in line, order, sit and someone brings you the food. The place is BUSY with 99% college kids. If you are a college kid, great! Just a heads up incase you planned on going here if you were seeking cozy, quiet, or relaxing..this is not the place. Not a knock, just informing. Its busy, crowded, and loud and uncomfortable seating with no backs..communal tables and a few booths.The food was good, but fast-food good. I had the salad which was fresh, no complaints for what its is..fresh fast food. All the food looked very good. Kinda disappointed no healthier options, only friend foods, no grilled chicken..again, not a knock but dont go if you are seeking low calorie or low carb!"
"5.0","The menu looks busy at first but is simple enough to easily understand the choices of ingredients. I went with the carnitas tacos with corn tortillas and no pico de gallo. I asked the waitress if my tacos could go light on the mexican slaw when a young chef cheerfully insisted that I should go with the usual amount since it's so good. And omg it was. The meat was a little dry in my opinion but the lime given along with the slaw added enough moisture to make up for it and the flavors were just mouthwatering. I ordered 2 tacos but I wish I had the stomach for more. They got nice music in my personal opinion.They use the electronic-tip choice for when you pay, which I'm not a huge fan of because that's before the experience so how will I know if the food and employees are above and beyond like this! Next time I'll leave a tip for sure!"
"5.0","The food and service was outstanding. The Szechuan Chicken was delicious and perfectly spiced. The Shrimp egg roll was huge and the hot and sour soup was some of the best I've ever had."
"1.0","Arguably the worst food I've ever had. Chicken was dry, Flatbread was atrocious and the service was sub par. The only amiable thing they have to offer is good TV's and a good location."
"5.0","i've tried them all and this is the best thai food in town. the prices are reasonable considering that splitting an appetizer and an entree between 2 people is more than enough, otherwise, you've got your late night leftovers.lunchtime there is the best deal around. i'm not a vegetarian, but i always get the tofu option when i eat here. the lunch starts you off (price included) with lemongrass or wonton soup and a springroll with sambal(?) (a spicier, more delicious version of duck sauce). i've never bothered with the wonton, because the lemongrass soup is flavorful with a definite kick to it.if you're not too adventurous with thai food, the general tso is pretty delicious, but you might as well try something new. the curries are always spiced how you want them, unlike the lemongrass cafe's downtown, and their noodle dishes are awesome. my personal favorite is the pad kee mow. whoever decided to cook with lemongrass is a total genius.at dinnertime, the green papaya  salad is delicious. shredded green papaya, chunks of shrimp, and a peanut sambal sauce. the appetizer sampler platter is great for sharing. hopefully, you'll still have room for the main course.the service is friendly, casual, and all family as far as i can tell, unlike thai cuisine up the street. the decor is fresh, cute, and a little bit campy though sometimes there's a musak soundtrack on featuring simplified james blunt and celine dion. strange as that may sound, it enhances the experience."
"5.0","So in my second and third visits I decided to update my review from yes to *insert expletive here* yes!The place is consistently good. The special changes and the quality remains the same. Ownership clearly gives a care about the satisfaction of their customers. This place doesn't over-brand and then push the price based on it being a trendy cool spot. They should change the name to hey man, here's a taco, I hope you enjoy it and also your day. Granted that wouldn't fit on the sign and is a mouth-full(pun intended) so Doce Taqueria is fine. A place like this deserves the traffic simply because it 1. Is simple and priced accordingly2. It is quick and convenient and tasty(quality meat). 3. It's a pleasure just visiting when the staff and ownership are chill chill cool beans.Bottom line go to Doce if you're hungry and want a taco man.Go if you're not hungry and want a taco. Just go!"
"5.0","First day in Pittsburgh I was looking for a bar that served good cocktails close to my hotel. The Summit popped on my search and it didnt disappoint. Daniel was our bartender and did a great job executing the drinks. My Gimlet and the Amabel were spot on. Food wise we had the Smoked Gouda Mac and Cheese (fantastic) Spinach Artichoke and Crab app (Good). Vibe was awesome and I would highly recommend to anyone."
"4.0","Lovers of food love to hate Subway, and I grew weary of them over time as well, but I have a hot tip for y'all regarding this particular franchise.It's right down the street from The Original Hot Dog Shop, and anyone who knows 'The O' knows to avoid their bathrooms. I lunched there yesterday afternoon for the first time in over 20 years, and while the bathroom was not as foul as I remembered, the gentleman's stall had no door on it.So to Subway I walked. The chap behind the counter didn't even ask me to buy anything in order to use the restroom (many Subway proprietrs want you to purchase something before they'll give you a key), but I advise you to at least purchase a cookie (just 52 cents) in order to keep management copacetic about area diners using their facilities. And MAN, was that bathroom cleaner than a drill sergeant's private quarters!Whew! Thanks Subway. P.S. There are 4 Subways in Oakland! 4!P.P.S. Consider my rating one based on sterling customer service and convenience alone. Those cookies aren't half-bad either."
"5.0","I pick a different place for brunch each weekend. I really enjoyed Cafe Raymond. You order at the counter, pay and get assigned a table. Food is good. Portions are ample. I will return!"
"2.0","For the money, go somewhere else! I ordered the mussels with white wine and it was ok, they need to learn how to cook shellfish! For my entree I order Caesar salad with Shrimp and Shrimp was cold and like leather!I was disappointed...."
"5.0","The chicken is good. BUT I Just tried damn hot chicken tenders. Let me say this, if you just 'like' or good at eating spicy stuff, DONT EVEN TRY THIS. This is for someone who LOVE, I mean LOVE and ABLE to eat VERY spicy thing. I got my friends from India, Mexico, Sichuan China, Hunan China tried this, they were scrolled up. BE CAREFUL before you order this even they do not require you to sign some wave.It burns your mouth first, then stomach, and a** the next morning. Other than that, this place has the best chicken I've ever eaten."
"5.0","One of the best meals I have ever had! Great food, prices and service! Awesome little gem with amazing gourmet 'fast food'"
"3.0","Decent food. Not the greatest customer service. I had their lamb bulgogi and coffee. It was tasty but I felt it would've been better without the gristle. Never received a refill on coffee."
"4.0","Had lunch at Luke's. Enjoyed a great salad topped with Wild Alaskan Salmon. Wife had a great fish sandwich. Service was very good as well. With the check I used a $12 off Enjoy Coupon Book coupon. When server returned with the adjusted check, he pointed out restaurant's policy when using Enjoy coupon was to automatically add an 18% gratuity to the subtotal before discount. Not only is that not stated on their coupon but when calculating the 18%, they do it not just on the subtotal before discount but they add on the 7% sales tax. Tipping norms are that you don't include the amount WITH tax, when calculating tip, but it's the amount WITHOUT tax."
"4.0","The restaurant is a little small but the food is great. I was in Pittsburgh for just a weekend but had such a great time at breakfast on Saturday that I came back the day right after. Everyone's reviews and recommendations for the hotcakes are correct - my favorite was blueberry! If you come at peak hours be prepared to wait a bit but what can you expect with such a popular place? I felt like it was worth the wait and it's a plus that it's on a nice street with lots of unique boutique shops where you can look around. The only bummer is that it's cash only."
"3.0","My go to place before afternoon classes at Sennott Sq. It gets really crowded during day time, sometimes noisy. Otherwise a good place to do some last minute study before your midterm or final."
"5.0","I only had a dessert but oh what a dessert it was--chocolate mousse and wafer with a bit of chocolate sauce drizzled on and a bit more in the way of tasty goodies that might spike your blood sugar but will at least make you happy in the process. It's a delicious dessert and I'd go out if my way to get it again. If that is indicative of the rest of their menu then I'd certainly try more."
"3.0","I stopped by here last night with my wife for dinner.  The Prince of India is located right on Fifth Ave and was easy to find.  Upon entering the restaurant we saw a sign telling us to wait to be seated and within 30 seconds or so were on our way to the table.  We ended up in a booth but there were also some regular tables as well.  After getting seated we were asked whether we wanted the buffet or regular menu and we both choose the regular menu.  They also had a decent happy hour going on (4:00 or 4:30 - 7:00 PM) which had Yuenglings for $2 and Dales Pale Ale for $2.75.For dinner on this evening I decided to go with the chicken curry while my wife went with her standby, the chicken tikka masala.  Both my wife and I were asked how spicy we would like our food and My wife went with a mild and upon my choice of Hot, I was told to give the number between 1-10 and chose 8.  We also decided to split some garlic naan and I ordered a Dales Pale Ale while my wife went with water.  After a short wait all of our food came to the table and it was definitely the naan which looked the best.  On my first bite of chicken curry I realized how hot they had made the dish.  It was hot to the point where I could hardly taste the spices in the chicken.  That's not a complaint about Prince of India as that's how an 8 probably should be, but more of a comment about how most other restaurants won't give you a super spicy dish.  The chicken in my dish ended up being cooked nicely and was hot temperature wise and juicy.  My only complaint about the dish was that there wasn't enough of the chicken, especially for the $12.50 price.  While eating my entree I also dug into the naan which ended up being fantastic.  It had a nice texture to it and was covered with a lot of garlic which gave it some great flavor.  My wife enjoyed both it and her entree.The bottom line for me is that I might stop by here again in the future.  The Prince of India has a nice happy hour and I appreciated the fact that they made their food spicy when requested, now if there was just a bit more of it."
"5.0","Food truck only:I went to Thrival Fest last weekend and tried a taco after long last!! I have followed them on Instagram for some time but never got around to it. Boy was that a mistake! I don't think I can say enough wonderful things about the taco I had, but I will try. They had a very small and to the point menu, with one vegetarian option, so that is what I ordered. The tacos were $4 each and absolutely perfectly sized for the price. They don't short you on the filling! Enough filling that I ate it with a fork. You have an option of corn or flour tortillas, which is also excellent. Although I have heard good things about their corn tortillas, I opted for the flour just because I like flour tortillas better. I'm a poser, I know! The filling for the veg taco was perfectly spicy and all around a really excellent taco. They seem to have a different sort of taco for their restaurant menu as opposed to the food truck menu when it comes to vegetarians/vegans, so I will have to swing by the southside and try it! Definitely recommend!"

"4.0","Oh my GOD. Get on line. Let Pamela's seduce your tastebuds into your imminent food coma.The wait & service: Pretty decent considering the overwhelming flow of people in and out of this fine establishment. The evil part is that they make you wait outside while you stare at the unlucky window-seaters chomp away at their food. Service was a little shoddy and unresponsive. I had to steal syrup from a neighboring empty table. -1/2 star.The hours: This is delicious, greasy, goodness. It'd be amazing drunk food if they were open late at night -- closed in the middle of the afternoon...what gives? -1/2 star.THE BANANA WALNUT HOTCAKES:ARGHHHH SO FRUSTRATINGLY GOOD!!!! They are delicious, filling, crispy, succulent, flavorful, and so addicting. The only thing missing was the jar of Nutella that I should have brought. THE CORNED BEEF HASH:This i saved for later, as the hotcakes were surprisingly filling. The potatoes were well cooked and it was a great salty break from my assault on the hotcakes."

"1.0","You only come here for one reason....the $5 large cheese pizza. It's carry out only and anyone who lives within a 4 block radius of this place knows all about this. The pizza isn't that great but if it's midnight, you're piss drunk and need some food....this is where you come."
"1.0","Was verbally assaulted by the owner DO NOT GO HERE!!! Following our extremely long wait to order, we were seated in the worst table in the entire restaurant. When we moved to a better table we were told we could not sit there (the place was EMPTY) because they might fill up. Asked to speak to a manager and was aggressively met by the owner, Raymond. He began yelling and cursing at me. Asked him not to yell at me and requested my money back. He continued on for some time yelling and cursing at me before instructing an employee to provide a refund. Debated calling the police to report this assault, however did not want to wait and gamble further escalation while we waited for officer response. This is unacceptable behavior for anyone, especially for a business owner to aggressively intimidate and assault not only a paying customer but a woman as well. Will be reporting this experience through all means of social media, travel sites, and making formal complaints through AAA and the Pittsburgh department of tourism. No one else should have to go through this experience and be threatened by anyone. Will never be back and work to spread the word to all who will listen."
"5.0","Ate here years ago and thought they closed but I have to say it was the best sushi I ever ate.  They use to have every 3rd tuesday was all you can eat sushi and tempura and the sushi rice was different than any I ever had.  It was probably over 10 yrs ago and I still remember.  Wow is all I can say!"
"5.0","Love this place! I live in the neighborhood and it is a huge bonus to have these folks around. They have a decent grocery selection, great sammies, good coffee, and a free seed bank for anyone wanting to garden or wanting to share a surplus of seeds they may have. The place is really cute and the staff is just lovely."
"5.0","Every time I stop here for dinner it is a pleasure. Excellent service, good food. Green salads, tasty pastas, warm atmosphere. A bit difficult parking on Liberty, try a side street."
"5.0","The wait staff is so friendly. The Menu has a lot to choose from. Sometimes they run of things - but they always have great replacement options and work really hard to accommodate you. There are wine specials a few times a week, and always plenty of parking. I love it here, it's my go to for me and hubby's date night."
"2.0","Hearing about Il Tetto & seeing it for the first time gets you very excited. Then you talk to the people who work there. I have tried it three different times & every time the experience is the same. I have asked several other people their opinion & they agree with me. We went up there waiting for our table at Sienna Mercato & are always treated with disrespect & eye rolls. They act like their tables are gold plated reserved for royalty. It also takes ten years to get a drink at the bar. The tables are always dirty with other people's drinks. It's definitely not worth going there. Next time I will go down the street to Seviche until No Wait says my table is ready. If they don't cleanup their act they will close. The bad service baffles me because it is so great at Sienna Mercato & Sienna on the plaza. I heard mezzo is great too. Il Tetto, get your act together & Fire your surly hostesses."
"4.0","We had been here for dinner. We had tomato soup and sweet corn soup. For appetizer, we had papdi chat. For the main course we had veg biryani. For dessert we had gulab jamun, rasmalai, gajar halwa. The food quality was good overall."
"5.0","Delicious food, fun bartender, cool decor! Highly recommend checking this place out if you're in Pittsburgh."
"5.0","My boyfriend and I came here for the first time today for our 1.5 yr anniversary and we brought our puppy, and it was AMAZING. The staff was great with our dog! Everyone was so friendly especially our waiter George! He was very prompt, friendly, knowledgeable and GREAT with our puppy. Brought him water and ice frequently! As a young couple about to relocate to Pittsburgh, this was the experience we needed. We would highly recommend this place to everyone and anyone! Can't wait to move here and come back!!"
"5.0","Awesome authentic tacos. Omg. It wasn't until I finished eating that I realized I should've taken a photo.  I savored every moment while eating. Not only are they friendly but their tacos are packed with flavor. I'll definitely make this my go to spot on Carson. You can't beat three dollars tacos."
"5.0","Cool place. Small and simple but really tasty from what I can tell. Got bowl instead of taco (I know, it's a taco place but cutting carbs). Really good. Can't wait to come back and overdose on tacos when I'm off this carb thing! Need a fish taco though."
"1.0","I finally got sick from this place.There is a MAJOR cleanliness issue.  Picture dirty trays used by other customers piled two feet (yes) high on top of a trash can overflowing with garbage, immediately next to the utensils and napkins you're supposed to use.  I've never seen a single table wiped down between customers.There are flies flying through the dining room.There is the overwhelming scent of raw meat that wafts in from the equally disgusting grocery store.  The refrigerator coolers they keep raw chicken kabobs and such in are WARM to the touch. If this is what we see front of house, I dont want to know what goes on in the back.  I was extremely ill within an hour after eating here.  The food is good but I did not enjoy it the second time.I just can't ever bring myself to come back here.Also the high chair is covered in filth.  I can't imagine anyone seating their child in it."
"2.0","Lousy experience at this Taco Bell. I visited on Sunday morning during football season and this place was short staffed. After cashier eventually came and took my order, it took several minutes for it to arrive. Condiments were filled, but there were no napkins in dispenser. Workers also had to explain how to enter bathroom since new sensor and lock were malfunctioning. I previously worked at a Taco Bell franchise in high school and saw exemplary service. It sadly was absent at this location."
"1.0","1.5This place is definitely aimed towards college students. The music is incredibly loud and you could barely hear your conversations; however, the atmosphere and decoration were pretty nice. As for the food, I would not come back to eat it again. The chicken was overall bland and flavorless, and you can only actually taste the heat. The french fries were below subpar and their waffles acted as a vehicle for syrup and nothing more. The service was good and you definitely got your meal fast."
"5.0","Best wedding soup you'll ever have! Maria is such a good cook, it's always a treat to head to her bakery in the back and pick out something savory.  Giant pepperoni rolls, she's amazing - I'm willing to put money down that she is the best cook in Pittsburgh!!"
"2.0","My first visit to this V3 location will also be my last, as that visit was difficult and chaotic. I walked in wanting to get dinner to-go. Note that when you walk in, you walk past some tables and a biiiiig menu on the wall. Since the line was moving so slowly, I went ahead and read the menu on the wall while I waited.That was a mistake, since the big menu that grabs your eyes while you're in line is NOT their daily menu. The items on it are available on rotation, as a Special of the Day sort of deal. Why in the world they've designed their eatery to prominently feature food that's not constantly available, I don't know. They have printed menus as well, so...put the specials there, too?But whatever. Since I'd been thinking of two different flatbreads, I went ahead and just ordered the one. Honestly, since I was trying to get home I don't think I had the energy or desire to pick something else at that point. Let alone making something else, since one of V3's claims to fame is the ability to make your own customized flatbread. By the way, V3 does deserve credit for having so many food options. A regular menu, the make-it-your-way menu, and a rotating specials menu. That's a lot of flatbread possibilities!So. At this point in the visit, I'm ready to pay and to get my food. However, I kid you not, the man running the register literally turned away from me after ringing out the person in front of me; watched the other workers making flatbreads for a minute straight; and then strolled off to the back. Not once did he look at me or speak to me about why he was waiting, what was on his mind, where he was going, etc. Let me be clear - being on your feet all day is hard. I don't mind someone walking off and getting a drink or taking a minute to let the staff 'catch up' on an influx of orders. Just. Tell me that's what you're doing. Communicate. Keep me as the customer posted on what to expect.Eventually another lovely gentlemen got me through the payment part of the visit (honestly he was the nicest person in the whole place), and he gave me a number for my order. I have no idea why anyone bothered assigning numbers, though, since not a single person actually called out the numbers. Instead they began scrambling and shouting out the names of the flatbreads being finished. I even had to remind them which order was mine a couple times because they would try to bring me the wrong one.The whole visit was a mess, and I was so happy when I finally left with my flatbread box in hand. If this was a new eatery, I'd be more understanding, but clearly given the dates on their reviews, they've had more than enough time to work out the glitches in their system. Disorganization plus rude staff? I don't care how good the flatbread was in the end (which it was) - I won't be back here."
"3.0","Went for lunch with my boyfriend, since we both work downtown and like to try different places on our lunch hour. The food was ok. I received a different flatbread than the one i ordered. The one I got was fine, and, good thing, because I didn't have time to wait for another to be cooked for me. When I told the waitress (which I HATE HATE HATE complaining about stuff like this anyway, this is what years of working in food service does to a person), but when I told her, she didn't apologize or anything, she just sort of stared at me. And I still got charged for the item. I thought courtesy would at least mean you get your incorrect item half of, at the very least. That's what a lot of other places do anyway. Just sort of a ho-hum place. Boyfriend ordered a turkey sammy on ciabata bread, and it was nearly all bread. He complained about it being very bland and the turkey not having any flavor. For $25 for two people, we could have eaten at Six Penn, Cafe Amante... both of which have better service and quality of food."
"5.0","I visited about 2 weeks ago with a friend and we ordered a variety of foods to try. Both of us had never had Portuguese food before so everything sounded and looked enticing. I've had a typical Chinese egg tart before but the Portuguese egg tart or the nata was a lot more creamy and soft-tasting. The cinnamon cappuccino was really warming and had a great presentation. The shrimp entree and the sauce that came on the side were well-seasoned and flavorful. It was bit of an annoyance to pull the shrimp tails off, however. The chorizo omelette was pretty standard and straightforward and the home fries are different from typical but was still pretty good. I would definitely return to try the other drinks on the menu as well as the other pastries."
"1.0","Absolutely disgusting. Entrees arrived with a full inch of grease pooled on the top and the sauces were gloppy and unappetizing. I had Malai Koftas, and the koftas were like giant balls of flavorless paste. Even the naan was bad. Naan is easy as hell for even this home cook to make, there is no excuse for that. Never ever eat here."
"5.0","A gut truck no m√°s! This hombre is living the American dream and turned this into a full fledged restaurant. It's still in the works, but has so much potential. You still have to order from the front cashier, but it looks like they'll be taking tableside orders soon. It also looks like they're about to have a bar soon! There's still a steel encased salsa bar, a schmattering of Mexican refreshments, and all the Mexican meal basics. This place is legit. Bring your hankering-for-Mexican ass down here and give them your money so they can take this restaurant to the next level!"
"4.0","I've never ordered something that I didn't love! The French fries are the best I've ever had!! Everything is so cheap and you get a TON of food! The staff is so friendly"
"1.0","I was expecting really great food from the ratings but this was basically cafeteria food. The teriyaki chicken tasted like something I ate in high school 10 years ago. The tonkatsu was almost inedible as the meat inside was so chewy and stiff that the breaded outside kept falling off. The miso soup was bland and nothing to talk about and the sushi was really mediocre, especially for the price. They had a good crab/potato fried side that was pretty good but that's literally all. Not to mention the prices are outrageous and the meal doesn't even come with salad. I don't know if we went on a bad day but there was hardly anyone there and it was hardly worth half the price we paid."
"3.0","Is it the best Indian food I've ever had? No. Does it get the job done? Absolutely!My BF and I go here regularly.  I always get chicken makhni with garlic naan and he will get vindaloo, mango curry or tikka masala.  Most of the time it's really good and fulfills the craving.  Service is also good."
"4.0","We went there at 6 on a Friday night and it had many space left.We had the popular lobster bisque and stuffed salmon. They were fine. No mistakes but also no surprises. The bisque was not as salty as others I tasted in other restaurants, instead they had a very salty bread to mix the flavor. They clearly designed the sauce for the stuffed salmon carefully. However, it made the salmon taste like fried ribbonfish? I was disappointed by this. The kale was good though. That is my favourite among these two dishes. It is sweet and buttery. Not bitter tastes at all.However, the crusted ahi tuna was definitely a 5 star dish. With the right amount of caviar and wasabi, the lighted baked tuna had a special texture and taste. The  fried asparagus was also a suprise. It was like eating tempura but with veggie inside. Totally worth the 30 bucks.In summary, good place. Generally I like the eating experience here. But some dishes may not worth the money."
"5.0","Good food.  Great service.  Nice and fun.  I really enjoyed everything.  I will definitely come again.  Yum yum yum.  So come on down and enjoy the ride."
"5.0","Absolutely Amazing Fine dinning Steak house! Took my Husband for his Birthday dinner was so delicious! We started out with Appetizers we had Cast Iron Garlic Shrimp with olive oil crostini (5) and Tuna Tartare with Avocado, Mango and Sriracha both were very good. We both had Filet Mignon 10 oz with Au Poivre with Courvoisier Cream. One of the best steaks I have ever had. They brought out my husband a Birthday dessert plater with Flourless Chocolate cake and Cheesecake Br√ªl√©e style with Berries. It is pricey but it is a very classy upscale steakhouse with very attentive and friendly staff. Very nice place for special occasions I highly recommended going to Capital Grille"
"4.0","Walking along the strip unsure about what was going to be eaten for lunch. Delucas vs. Primanti Bros vs. Peppi's. Peppi's won probably because it was so simple. Food: I got the Steak/Sausage sub with no cheese. It is called the Big Wheeler. The bread was nice and soft but it held the meat within (Pause). I was just eating that sandwich shaking my head because it was so damn good. I think next time I will just get a sausage sub because I think the sausage was the MVP of the sandwich.Workers: They seemed like down to earth folks. We thanked them for making such good food and they seemed appreciative. No issues here. Atmosphere: Small little spot. Nothing jumps out here but that shouldn't matter. The food is on point. If you are around The Strip, please go."
"3.0","This place needs to decide if it's a juke joint or a sports bar - constant interruption of the Army Navy game audio with jukebox selections ...I love the Eagles, but I selected this place to watch a football game not listen to the 70's greatest hits!"
"3.0","My review is more of a 3.5 instead of a 3, but alas there is no such option. Went to this place on a Tuesday night and was pleasantly surprised. The interior is small and sort of kitschy with the decor, and the service was very attentive and friendly. We had an order of the fresh summer rolls with chicken to start. They weren't horrible, but there was too much iceberg lettuce and the chicken was dry, but the sauce made them passable. I got the red curry with pork and my friend got the fried rice with pork. My curry was thick and creamy but the pork was very dry. I loved it anyhow and would probably get it again with a different protein or stick with the veggie version. I was able to taste the fried rice and it was yummy, although heavy with sauce so I probably wouldn't order it for myself. All in all I had a good experience and am definitely excited to try something different."
"1.0","Antoons sucks. It's just a shit dough pizza wit butt ass cheese and zero sauce. I don't care that it's $5. Id rather spend that $5 on a Red Baron than eat this garbage pie"
"5.0","Most underrated place.  Totally awesome customer service.Me: Hey, remember that drink you made me last week?  Bartender: Yep, let me get that for you.Literally happened to me the second time I went there.  Just awesome.  Food is amazing also."
"5.0","Classic Pittsburgh staple for breakfast. 10/10 when you ask where is the best place to get breakfast in Pittsburgh, you're going to hear Pamela's. It's no surprise when you walk in and eat why this is the case. There are a number of Pamela's throughout the city, each with its own personality and vibe. But at the end of the day, one thing remains constant and that's the quality of the food.I'm personally biased towards diners, and being to so many I've seen it all from down right disgusting to practically perfect. Pamela's is practically perfect when you think of a diner. Quick, delicious, no-frill American favorites. Two things that are a must every time you come are the Lyonnaise potatoes and the crepe-style hotcakes. Trust me, you will not be disappointed.I wish that I could keep going on about how great it is here, but I think you should come and see for yourself. Happy dining!"
"5.0","Easily 5 stars: delicious food, salad/bread included in the entree, attentive service, and BYOBTheir prices are extremely reasonable for what you get - huge portions that you leave more than satisfied and every entr√©e includes a starter salad and bread with bean dip, similar to a hummus, that's loaded with tomatoes and balsamic vinegar.I feel like the majority of BYOBs in Pittsburgh are a range of Asian restaurants or generic Italian, but Pittsburgh needs more BYOBs like Sausalido. Their menu is creative and well-rounded with seasonal specials with something to please everyone - seafood, pasta, steak. I ordered the crab cakes - crispy on the outside with the perfect ratio of crab to filling, and it comes with a rich and flavorful risotto. I would definitely order it again, but I'm also tempted by almost every entr√©e on the menu!"
"3.0","Bettis Grille is just alright in my opinion. No wow factor here, just typical bar food. I've been here twice and the food was good both times just nothing to rave about. I had the southwest club last time and it was just what I was craving. I would def go back and get it again. My brother had the fried deviled eggs and really liked them. They also have a deep fried Italian hoagie and cheeseburger which sounds interesting. On my last trip the service was ok. Our waitress seemed busy but still attentive. Food took a while to come out. They sat us in the back dining room all in one cluster. The back side of the room wasn't being used so it was a little odd. All the tables were kinda crammed together. The bar area is nice. It def a nice bar to sit at for a few beers and to watch football. Im sure I'll be back at some point. I'd recommend trying it at least once."
"1.0","Do not waste your time coming here! The food is not good and the service is even worse. The girls that work behind the counter are extremely rude! I was rushed and talked down to when I wasn't sure how to order. What's worse than the service is the time you have to wait to get your items! I waited over 10 minutes to get an iced chai latte, 10 minutes!!! When I finally got the latte is was by far the worst I've had!"
"5.0","I was in town playing music and saw this pop up on Yelp so I decided to check it out since I absolutely love tacos. It was definitely the right choice. But before I talk about food, I kind of want to give it a 4 star only because of how small the location was. It seems popular and the food is very good, so I would imagine it's pretty crowded more often than not. I like sitting down to eat and I ended up having to stand outside and eat over my to go container unfortunately. Hopefully they can expand to a larger location because the food definitely made up for it.Onto the tacos.. The portions were very fair for a taco spot. Normally i go for 3 tacos, but two was more than filling. I went for pollo and carnitas and they were both very tasty and surely a little more unique than your standard street taco because of the ingredients. The chicken taco had avacado and a cholula cream drizzle and the carnitas had a Mexican slaw; and they both came with cheese, pico, cilantro, and lime. I also really enjoy yellow corn tortillas over white corn, so that was a great little surprise. They also had a vegan option available along with a walking taco in a Doritos bag. Pretty awesome! If you are in the area and overwhelmed with all of the choices nearby, this is a great quick or late night option."
"1.0","It is great if you are looking for old fashioned Italian Cusine. I am 55 and I was probably youngest patron. Big portions reasonably priced polite service but food was good for senior citizen. If you are looking to fill up go for it. If you are looking for culinary experience avoid it. Have a good day"
"5.0","Stopped here for dinner with a friend one night. I was greeted upon arrival and given my choice of table, since the place wasn't super busy (I went on a week night). Our waiter was attentive and willing to answer any questions that we had. After reviewing the menu, I decided on the blackened swordfish. It came with a side of asparagus and mashed potatoes. *oh and the best part, is that the swordfish is topped with lump crab meat! The food didn't take long at all and before we knew it, dinner was served! I was pleasantly surprised at the portion of food. I was able to take half of the swordfish and mashed potatoes home for my lunch the next day. Everything was seasoned perfectly and cooked just right. This wasn't my first visit to Luke Wholey's but it was my first time trying the swordfish. I will definitely get that time and time again!"
"5.0","This is a great sandwich place! They use the softest Mancini's rolls and grill up your order fresh. I always get the pepper steak. The staff is friendly. Make sure to get there early because this place gets busy quick!"
"3.0","Straight down the middle.I tried the lunch buffet to get a sense of their style of Indian cuisine and found that it was well stocked; appeared to be clean and sanitary; and with a good amount of options. At bat for the veg team were vegetable korma, palak paneer, channa masala, and pakora masala. Assisting were vegetable pakoras, plain naan, basmati rice,  papadam, raita, salad fixings, a good assortment of chutneys (about 5), and fountain drinks included in the buffet price. Batting cleanup were galub jamun and rice pudding. Quite a spread, especially considering there were also about 4 meatalicious entrees all for about $8.99. I'm not sure if the special runs everyday, but 10% is taken off if you are a local student and show ID.So, why the A-OK rating? While items of concern such as service, cleanliness, atmosphere, etc. were as they ought to be, the food taste didn't have the spark that I look for in my dining experiences. I honestly appreciated that there were veg dishes that had a little spice to them and that there were so many options, but their curry interpretations are very creamy, which just isn't my bag. To each their own, and this may be right up your alley."
"4.0","Excellent cocktails, great beer selection, and great food. The location is fun. Easygoing staff. Take the monongahela incline from the station square area to the Mt. Washington neighborhood. There is absolutely nothing of interest in station square. It is just a bunch of chain garbage, So take the trouble and go up the hill. The Summit is worth it."
"4.0","If you enjoy a good Moscow Mule, this place should be put on your 'Must-Try' List. I'm a girl that enjoys a good Moscow Mule, and this was one of the best I've ever had. The house-made ginger beer was exceptional, but the house-made ginger CANDY it's garnished with really made it.I also tried the goat cheese fritters (to die for!) and even had them make me a drink that wasn't on the menu... I wanted to utilize the espresso maker behind the bar!Great drinks, food, and service, but it's kind of small, so get there right before happy hour starts!"
"4.0","I came here on a Friday night for a bit to eat. They have a wide menu or burgers to choose from with different meats, and of course you can build your own burger.  The burgers come with a side of rosemary fries which are very delicious. I got a build your own burger for $10.  The burger was good and cooked to my liking, but the toppings looked like they were just kinda tossed on without care.  The red onions where chunky and not cut into small slices, which I hate because most people don't like biting into a big piece of onion. Over all the place is not horrible, but if you want a great burger I would recommend going somewhere else."
"4.0","Took clients and their wives for dinner.  The experience was over the top.  The service the minute we sat down to the very end was exceptional.  The food was outstanding and the portions were very good.  Everyone at the table had a great time.  We definitely plan on going back......if you want to make a positive impression on someone special in your life......bring them here."
"4.0","When you don't even like pancakes, but the blueberry ricotta ones at Cafe Raymond speak to you????   They were delicious - light, fluffy and simply amazing.  Friendly staff.  A great cup of coffee too.  When the weather is nice you can sit on the rooftop with the hustle and bustle of the strip on a weekend morning."
"2.0","Definitely was a let down. Nothing was delicious, all food was just EH, okay.. Nothing I would go and purchase again"
"3.0","I really wanted Alexanders to be great - like a hidden gem in a sea of Big Burritos and high-priced Shadyside Italian joints. Well, it was well priced, but the food was just... okay. They didn't go that extra mile to make it great. I had the blackened ahi tuna salad - the tuna was fantastic, but the dressing came in a plastic condiment cup with a lid and the tuna looked real lonely on some standard dark salad greens. Pasta portions were generous... but again, not fantastic. Joe Mama's actually has better pasta. Half-priced wine by the glass - also generous. However there was lipstick permanently imprinted into the glass I got. The bar looks really nice and the dining room was more like a living room painted warm colors and filled with booths. I really wanted to like it. But I also wanted to comment on how the stellar review from an unknown source underneath the glass table top to read while you dine made it feel like some substandard tavern. I wanted to tell the waitresses screaming across the dining room to quite down because I can't hear the strangely out of place pop and rock music coming from the quality sound system over her asking if her customers want coffee with the dessert. I wanted a nice dinner at a beautiful restaurant. I got an OK one in a wonky dining room. If they take a step back and consider what they could do to make the place better, I think they can get there. However, that's not likely to happen without new management."
"5.0","This place was unbelievably out of this world !! From the moment u pull up to the place! Non stop service! First let me start off our waiter was absolutely amazing! Ask for Horacio!! He's great!! I ordered the filet 10oz and it was cooked to pure perfection! With sides of Au gratin potatoes and spinach! Which were also out of this world !!! For starters we had the calamari! And there's not enough stars here to give that order! My counter part ordered the filet Oscar med well- which is topped with fresh crab meat ... Soft like butter and fresh !! Amazing experience here! The ambiance is wonderful! This is a high end steak house!!! Loved it!"
"1.0","Worst Experience, I have been here 2 years ago and didn't like the food, I made another visit couple weeks back to see if things have might changed but they haven't . The food is terrible and so is the service, the place and bathrooms are dirty. I ordered Kadhai Paneer, Fried rice, Chana masala, Naan etc, none of them taste even close to good. For Indian dining I will recommend Mint, Tajmahal or udupi I think I am not going back again.."
"3.0","Really enjoyed the beer but the food just wasn't that good. They clearly put a lot of thought and effort into the menu, there is just too much of everything. Had the schnitzel sandwich but way too much mustard, giardiniera and capers. Served with a side of fries just hammered with salt and vinegar.I appreciate the unique menu and the thought behind it, and the base ideas sound good but are overpowered by the accompaniments."
"5.0","Honestly, subway is subway. No surprises about what you're getting. But in the whole scheme of subways, this location goes above and beyond. I walk away impressed with the staff and overall experience every time I go here. They are friendly, accurate, and make excellent sandwiches, even taking care to spread the tuna salad I ordered evenly on my bread. It's a welcome contrast to not only other subways, but the general experience I have at other places in the area employed by unfriendly/rude college kids."
"5.0","So delicious. Variety selections on the menu including pizza, wings, fresh salads and baked hoagies. Everything we ordered was fresh and hot out the oven. I would definitely recommend it."
"4.0","This is definitely one of the best taco places in Pittsburgh! You can't go wrong with any option. I came here on a Friday night around 9pm. It was just fully occupied, but we only had to wait literally one minute for two seats to open up. I tried the carnitas and ground beef tacos on corn tortillas. Both were awesome. All the ingredients worked really well together. And each taco is only $3! I definitely prefer Doce Taqueria to Las Palmas. Also, the service is great; everyone is clearly happy to be there.

"3.0","If it wasn't for the manager and server I would be leaving a 1. I won't say what happened with my food but they took care of it and went out of their way to give me extra fries and an on the house beer. They handled the situation great."
"3.0","OK - first the good news.  The food is very good and I have been there just twice.  But the service was pretty close to awful on my most recent - and last visit.  Was there for take out and after waiting over 40 minutes I asked if someone could check on my order.  One of the staff came out shortly with my food.  You would think they would have wanted to check me out as quickly as possible - but that took another 10 minutes to accomplish.  Not good because I made the fact that i was not pleased pretty obvious to a nearly full dinning room.  Eating out is a choice for us we love to cook - and I am too old to spend our money where the food and the SERVICE are not good."
"5.0","Very reasonably priced and great food. There's really nothing to say about the ambience. It's school cafeteria kind. I usually take out the beef bacon burger(All halal) or the curries or grilled fish. The naan is amazing! So is the tandoori chicken and mutton curry.The butcher section has marinated meat that's super helpful for a weekday meal. I go here once a week."
"5.0","You gotta have a bloody mary! The best!I had the crab sandwich & fries.Best crab cake ever. Didn't even need the bun!"
"4.0","I've been here several times and I have to say that they serve the BEST bloody mary's! Located in the Strip district, visitors and locals walk the streets to grab a bite and drink til their hearts desire. We decided to take some friends here this time during Memorial Weekend and it was crowded. I did see one empty table up front and quickly claimed that spot and told the hostess. However, she said that the wait time would be 30-45 minutes. Say what? I ain't got time for that. It's a good thing we got a bite to eat before having our second breakfast. I told the hostess that we were only there for drinks and we would be ordering quickly. She obliged. Yippie! We quickly got seated and ordered right away!Robert Wholey was walking by and stopped at our table to greet us. He was in civs so I didn't recognize him with his coat and hat but proudly stated that this was his son's place and that we needed to sit here as long as we liked because they need good looking people in the forefront. LOL I died... What a friendly man and yet he has a heart of gold!Anyways, because it's not in season we weren't able to order the softshell crab with our drinks. But we enjoyed the tomato-y peppery taste of our bloody mary's with candied bacon, a large stalk of celery, and chilled shrimps. It was delicious. (mine virgin of course) It was worth it! I'm buzzed off my baby so it is all good! My friends really enjoyed themselves.Other things that I have tried in the past were the lobster rolls (a must) and the key lime pie (better than the south! don't tell anyone i said that) and some other stuff. Overall, this place is a great place to hangout for brunch, grab a drink, and enjoy the day with your friends."
"5.0","I have been going to chikn for the past several weeks now and the food is wonderful. The hot chicken sandwich is amazing and the special coleslaw and sauce make it even better. I like the simplicity of the menu. This place blows chick fil a out of the water food wise. The reason for the low rating is the service.  The last time I went a few days ago I ordered 3 combo chicken sandwich and fry meals to go of course once I got a cashiers attention they are usually on their phones with their backs to the register. Anyway, they kindly bagged my boxes up and sent me on my way. I get home and they completely forgot 3 orders of fries. I tried calling and the phone number listed is just a recorded message and you can't talk to anyone. Then they said to contact them via email which I did and got no response. Going to Oakland is never a convenient experience for people who don't live there. The parking is always a huge hassle and expensive. I'm usually willing to suck it up and go here anyway but after this experience I don't know if I will do that anymore.*update the owner got in touch with me and refunded my money for the order. I highly recommend chikn. Despite my hiccup, they corrected their error and I will be sure to go back."
"5.0","This place is so lovely - what a beautiful space and awesome tea shop!  I'm so excited that my friends introduced me to a spot in the nearby neighborhood.  The place is bright, spacious with comfortable seating, exposed brick walls and a really great atmosphere.  They have a great selection of hot and cold tea and coffee beverages as well as baked goods and some great sandwiches, soup, and salads.  I love that everything is freshly made and I love to support a small business in my community.  I had the 'Just salad' which is a generous portion of mixed greens with tomatoes, olives, and some shredded cheese (you can get it without) and I had it with their delicious balsamic vinaigrette dressing!  I also had a chai latte which was perfectly steeped and had the perfect amount of spices.  I can't wait to go back for breakfast some weekend, and spend more time just hanging out at this wonderful local business!"
"5.0","Easily one of my favorite spots for a few delicious cocktails! I recently had a peach manhattan? Maybe old fashioned I can't remember... But it was tits! I'm not even an avid bourbon drinker but I was feeling risky that night and I'm glad I did! The bartenders are awesome and know how to perfectly interact with their guests. Such a perfect addition to Shiloh!"
"3.0","Ordered delivery to my hotel tonight.  Not sure why they didn't give me plates for my pizza.  Anyway the seafood pizza was decently tasty (not very hot when delivered and unfortunately I don't have a microwave in my hotel room).  No complaints with the seafood salad too.  For $9 I received a decent sized salad with shrimp and imitation crab. Took about 40 minutes for delivery which is totally acceptable.  They should try using non-generic pizza boxes to promote their name."
"4.0","Our waiter was great, the food was good! The burgers were really good but they seemed a little small, but maybe that is just because I'm not used to being able to even get my mouth around a burger from most places. The fries were eh, tasted a little old and getting the rosemary fries wasn't worth the extra $1"
"5.0","My mother visited this restaurant and couldn't stop talking about how good everything was.  That day I also went to the restaurant simply on her word. She also asked for more lol.  We picked up a beef burger, chicken burger, tandoori chicken, and chicken curry.  Everything was very good!  The place is clean, staff friendly, and it's busy busy busy but fast.  We had a few questions and they answered them and explained a few things in a friendly manner.  Absolutely recommend and I will return."
"2.0","Eh. This place is definitely not a destination for me when I go downtown and we only stop in when ... actually, I have no clue why we stop in. Maybe because we don't do Olive or Twist anymore?Anyway, the beer selection is ok, the bartenders I had last time were awesome, and the decor is odd. It's so sparse, I feel like something's missing. Like, the walls need 'something.' It's hard to explain.I have not eaten here and don't really have a desire to so I'll leave food reviews for others. I guess if everywhere else is packed, try here?"
"5.0","Great food and awesome service. The ambiance is also amazing and it is a fun place to go! The pumpkin risotto, salads, and cheese plates were all so delicious. Will definitely be back!"
"4.0","Small and neighborhoody, this is a 'joint,' plain and simple. Tacos are $3 a piece, drinks are $2 (oh, and no fancy pants cocktails here ... just sodas--all made with cane sugar--and water). And folks, it'll be the best $10-$15 you ever spend on tacos. There are 5 choices: carnitas (pork), chicken, spicy beef, American (read: NOT spicy) beef, and vegan. Dear GOD, are these tacos good. We (my adventurous eating kids and I) had an assortment, but agreed that the carnitas was far and away the best. We also had some refried bean dip, hot and steaming and yummy on a cold fall day, to mix things up a bit. There are just a few stools to sit on around the counter, and the folks who create this delicious goodness are friendly and chatty (and who totally indulged my daughters games and party tricks, which are endless).Super solid choice of yum in the South Side (I want to go back today!)"
"4.0","The best food you are going to get for your money anywhere near town. The Restaurant is set up Lunch room style. So get in line and pick your selections Middle Eastern foods. Great prices and great food."
"1.0","Don't go here. It is owned and operated by an Indian, and as a fellow Indian I know when I see a cheap Indian. The owner makes the subs and tries to put as little as possible on the sandwich. Your paying money for the guy to half way fill the scoops with meat and sprinkle a few lettuce on. Food is good, Clean environment, Cheap Owner. Don't go you won't get your moneys worth."
"5.0","Sincerely the best food truck in Pittsburgh! I've gone places just to eat their food. Highly recommend the dumplings and spicy Pork rice bowl. Amazing food and service!!"
"1.0","Went for lunch today, tables were sticky and the menu had dried food all over it. Ordered a kale salad but got spinach which was fine because I like both but you expect to get what you order.  Was swimming in so much dressing that it was not enjoyable. My friend had a bug in her salad.  Overall, the place felt dirty - I've been there several times before but thinking things may be going downhill."
"4.0","Had to wait 30 minutes to get in but didn't mind at all since it's worth the wait. The strawberry pancakes were so good. They were unique and very delicious! Inside was clean and they served you quick. The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because it's a cash only diner."
"5.0","Went for my anniversary. Everything was delicious! Service was fantastic! The mint lemonade was so refreshing with dinner Thank you"
"3.0","This place is mediocre for Indian food. We had the dinner buffet which comes with naan bread, fountain soda, and chai tea which is real yummy.  The price with tax is $12.86. The lighting is dim in this place. Especially over the buffet which makes no sense. Service is sub par. One server for the whole joint. Atmosphere is decent. They have warm lighting and a brick wall. Over all not bad but not great."
"5.0","Fresh ingredients and attention to detail yield delicious things here, not to mention this place is fun...a great escape from an otherwise hectic workday (even if it only lasted 15 mins)!"
"5.0","Yum! We haven't had their tacos in awhile since we aren't in the area very much anymore. We were thrilled to see them at Little Italy Days and enjoyed every single bite of our tacos. The ingredients are fresh, flavorful and compliment each other so well. The employees are friendly and super willing to make substitutions. As a vegetarian, I appreciate the multiple options and love that they put as much thought into the vegetarian dishes as their others. We never miss an opportunity to get their tacos and hope to stumble on their truck again soon!"
"4.0","I ordered a cheeseburger hoagie, fries and a soda to be delivered to my hotel.  They told me on the phone that it would be 45 minutes and and my food arrived 5 minutes shy of the estimate.    Everything was hot and fresh.   The hoagie roll was one of the best I have had and the hamburgers were much better quality than I usually find on a hoagie.  The fries were also very good and the order was big enough for two people.  I'll order from them again the next time I visit Pittsburgh. ."
"2.0","The food was OK. Expensive, but only OK. Some of the sushi might have been good (the fish was of decent quality), but the chef apparently believes in using lots of Wasabi. That ruins the taste of the fish in my books. A very small amount goes a really long way. Anything more and all you taste is Wasabi. Only places I found like that in Japan served really cheap sushi... So I spent much of the meal wiping down my fish and rice. Then the food was...OK"
"5.0","Rialto is actually my favorite pizza place in Pittsburgh so far. The crust is perfect and I actually want to eat it and not leave it on the plate! Their Sicilian pizza is mouthwatering and I love their regular pizza as well. I've also had their wings and soft serve! Delicious! I get so excited and happy when my sister-in-law walks in the door with boxes of Rialto's pizza."
"5.0","This place might very well be my favorite restaurant in Oakland. Ever single item on their menu is great. Their chicken tenders are homemade, the subs are incredible and the fries are the best I've ever had. I go here at least once a week and I confidently can say they are the best. They actually care about the food they make and their customers. 10/10 would recommend to everyone I know"
"5.0","We had a lunch there today with group of friends, I had Nutella crepe and some salad, it was so fresh and good. They have European ambiance and nice deck with colorful umbrellas, Will def coming back !!"
"4.0","Went last night with my wife for a date night.  We wanted to try someplace new and she wanted seafood.  I stumbled across the reviews here and decided to give it a shot.  I have to say I was quite pleased.  We were quickly seated and our waiter came over to take the order.  He was really good and made suggestions on both food and drinks.  We had the catfish bites as an app and it was excellent!  The fish was lightly breaded and the thai chili dipping sauce had a fantastic flavor.  For dinner, we both had the shrimp and scallops meal with two different preparations.  Both were very good but the blackened one was excellent in my opinion!  The only negative was the asparagus.  It seemed like it had been grilled hours ago and left to sit in a steamer or something for a long time.  It was tough, stringy and tasteless.  When I mentioned it to our waiter, he apologize profusely and offered us a dessert for free.  We ordered dessert but turned down the freebie as the bad veggie certainly didn't ruin the overall meal.I only gave it four stars because: a) it is kind of noisy inside and would be very noisy if the place was packed, b) the ambiance is a little strange, and c) the bad asparagus.I will definitely try it again in the future though."
"5.0","Best sushi I've had in Pittsburgh (and a number of other cities too). If you like nigiri, you're in for a treat. It may seem a little pricier compared to other Japanese places in Pittsburgh, but you quickly realize you're getting your money's worth and that it's a more than fair price for the quality you get. The value you get for what you pay exceeds what I've seen in NYC and the Bay Area. The quality of fish, the level of consistency, and the skill of the chefs is on par with and exceeds that of some establishments in those cities. This restaurant can easily hold its own against those (at the same price point) in London, NYC, SF, and DC (Japan does have better fish by far, but it's also a long flight away -- and it's Japan.) I liked their ika uniae (squid and sea urchin) appetizer, and their hotate nigiri was a unique and refreshing interpretation. I recall that they had sea urchin from Maine, which is rare these days. King salmon nigiri was good too. I sat at the sushi bar both times I've been there. My first time, I ordered the sushi lover for 2, which we felt was good value. My second time here, I ordered nigiri a la carte: I enjoyed the chef's recommendations. The tuna was good, and I especially enjoyed their chutoro. If there was one thing that could be improved, I felt that the nori (seaweed) could have been briefly toasted in the toaster oven to get it a little crisp. The reviewer who commented on the relative temperatures of the shari (rice) and neta (topping) had a point as well. Parking is convenient but unfortunately expensive. This is definitely good authentic Japanese food - I'd recommend it in a heartbeat. I enjoyed their mochi ice cream dessert as well."
"2.0","I'm so disappointed in a delivery I got from here tonight. Soggy cold mass of fries with congealed cheese on them. How hard is it to package the cheese sauce separately. The concoction that resembled a 7th grade science experiment gone wrong also was so salty I gagged. My 8-year-old refused to eat the mess. The burgers were ok but the amount of horsey sauce on mine created a near blowout of my nasal cavities. Finally, the RANCH salad dressing was sooooo off. It was basically a peppercorn dressing and my 8-year-old gave it a try and started coughing wildly. I thought she was exaggerating as kids are know too, but then I tasted it and also choking next to her. What a waste of $40. So bummed."
"5.0","Pete's a gem.  He really hustles for the customer and is doing his best to run a small little spot tucked away on the less busy part of W. Carson St.  Everything I've eaten here as been fantastic and if you come in with the realistic expectation of a diner / sandwich shop for the everyman, you're not going to be disappointed here."
"5.0","Absolutely delicious.  My husband ordered the sandwich ($9) I ordered the chicken & waffles ($8). Both were great potion sizes and very flavorful.  He ordered medium heat for his sandwich and it had a great kick to it. I ordered mild for my chicken and waffles. Full of flavor. I highly recommend."
"3.0","Average. Personally not worth the price. The food is nothing to write home about but the drinks Bradley poured were fantastic. Bradley was very nice and polite. We sat at his bar at 5pm as they opened and he gave us his undecided attention. Thanks again Bradley."
"1.0","Worst experience in a Pitt restaurant in 5 years. No wait seating for 6, great. Told dishwasher broke. Waiting on glasses. Took about 15 minutes to get 4 of 6 waters in plastic. order everything then. Drinks and 1 appetizer. 10 minutes later, told our drink order on 2 of 3 need to change. Ok. 15 minutes later receive drinks. 10 later, waiter asks if we are ok.  NO!  50 minutes. No appetizer or food. He says, now this is our waiter, ' I know dishwasher broken, not sure what's up with kitchen!!!!'  Shakes his head of not knowing. Dude, you are our waiter, you are awful!  We ask to find out because we are ready to leave. 5 later he brings out appetizer  he makes himself. Nachos and cold queso. 5 later food comes out. I have a Luke warm pasta dish. Other person with us, his burger totally wrong. We didn't even ask to fix at this point. Then 5 minutes later as we are eating, they bring out nachos and warm queso. Never an apology, owning up to mistakes or horrible waiter, or a discount. First time bringing  out of town family in town. Definitely made mistake choosing this place to impress family. If I could give it zero stars, I would."
"3.0","Burgh'ers is great if you want to get a burger and fries and that's about it. Although the burgers and fries are really good they are extremely overpriced. Last time I went there I wanted a burger with the game meat on it and it was a $9 up charge on an already $11 dollar burger! Overall a decent restaurant."
"1.0","Worst subway I've ever been to. Bread is dry ingredients are soggy. Employees do not listen and hate life. A little mayo apparently means one fat greasy soggy line of mayo. Dijon and pepperoncinis apparently doesn't mean anything to them. I almost got buffalo sauce when I said spicy mustard. If you come here pay attention while they make it and be willing to walk away from the grease mountain sandwich when they mess it up."
"5.0","Antoon's Pizza is the perfect ending to a night out. On any given week i probably have 2 to 3 boxes of Antoon's Pizza in my kitchen from myself or from having friends over. It's everything a college kid wants after going to the bars: Cheap, quick, greasy, and delicious. For $5 you can get a large cheese pizza and feed yourself and maybe two others depending on the crowd you're with. For those out-of-towners or those unfamiliar with how cheap Antoon's actually is, you become the hero of the night for feeding everyone, and you hardly spent a dime. Highly recommended for any college kid on a budget, and for anyone who for some reason goes to Sorrento's and doesn't know the magic of Antoon's."
"5.0","The chicken shawarma loves me and I love it right back. Yummy! This is a cafe where you stand in line to order and seat yourself.It can handle large groups of people. For our picnic later today we purchased tandoori chicken, nan, samosas, hummus, tabouleh and an absolutely lovely square of baklava. Lovely and friendly staff. Prices were very reasonable. Enjoy"
"4.0","I have been to Salem's before just to get halal meat. This is the only place or the reliable place to get halal meat. A number of choices to select for different meat kind and types. They have a grill next door which I wanted to try before and never had the opportunity to do so. The time came this time and I step into check their menu. They have a choice of Mediterranean and Indian style food options. When I saw the Shawarma on the board, I decided to go for the chicken version of it. I still miss the NJ Gypsy's grill Shawarma and this one in Pittsburgh came close to it. I loved the bread and the fold. The chicken was well cooked and the sauce was just the right amount. No dripping of sauce or any mess while eating. Neatly done. I will definitely go here again and try their other food item."
"5.0","Literally writing this because I can't stop craving their milkshakes... It's kind of becoming a diet. But seriously Eat'n Park is my jam. I'm all about any place that serves veggie burgers and Mac n cheese bites 247. Staff is always friendly and I don't care what anyone says I love a smiley cookie!"
"3.0","Went with a friend for lunch before a holiday performance. We arrived a few minutes late for our reservation, but they had our table prepared and ready. After waiting a few more minutes than I thought we should have, our waiter acknowledged us and, from there the service was fine - attentive without being intrusive.My friend ordered the salmon beet salad and thoroughly enjoyed it. The salmon was cooked to the desired temperature She was pleased with how the citrus worked with the other elements of the salad. I had the crab cake sandwich. While the flavors were good, the middle of the sandwich was refrigerator cold. Hopefully, this was an isolated incident and not a matter of overall inconsistency. I would go back again to give the restaurant another chance."
"5.0","We call this place 'Secret Pizza' because of how amazing it is and how hard it is to find when you're shitcanned. But it's our Secret Pizza, and we love it no matter what. Hoes down, G's up."
"5.0","Just stopped here for breakfast. It was great.. Good scrambled eggs and prosciutto but the hash 'browns' were tremendous. They're made with peppers and have a lovely red color and really rich taste. The coffee is also really good."
"5.0","Fast service, great food, cute atmosphere! The coffee drinks are always great! My boyfriend and I stopped by for brunch I had the French toast, so good loved the jam it came with! My boyfriend ordered a meat and egg skillet it was delicious. Would definitely 10/10 recommend!"
"5.0","I really enjoy this bar. It's a great place to take visiting friends and family. Always get great service from the manager, Casey. Looking forward to my next time there."
"5.0","Over the years, we've stopped in several times. I must admit that I was a bit put off learning their parent company is the same one that owns the Olive Garden and Bahama Breeze, but look: I've been to multiple 'upper echelon' local eateries. The places that have an instant aura of pretentiousness and fresh-faced head chefs who believe they're the best of the best. None of those places seem to deliver for me - expensive, but average food flaunted like culinary masterpieces. This pattern is one of the most prevolent and disturbing in modern dining for me.On the flip side, the Capital Grille has always had consistent, delicious food with attentive, friendly service. Yes, it's a chain and, yes, you're going to pay a bit more than an average night out. The food here is so worth it though! Personally, I don't have an issue splurging if the experience is worthwhile and, for me, it certainly is here. The steaks are fantastic! The sides are fantastic! The service is fantastic! I really have very few negative things to say about The Capital Grille.I guess my only gripe would be the other patrons. They do attract some high profile types; maybe some you'd call yuppies. Generally, people keep to themselves - I had a few people cut in front of me in the coat check line. I guess those big shots had some big things going on - haha! The staff certainly isn't uppity or rude. They are extremely accommodating and attentive.If you're looking for a great meal downtown, give The Capital Grille a try!! You'll pay a little more, but you'll go home happy and fulfilled!"
"5.0","Visiting the area and discovered this spot. The type of shop you always hope to find. I wish there was one of these closer to my home."
"2.0","The food was amazing, however the service is terrible. Do not dine here if you need to be somewhere afterwards.We had a reservation for 2 at 8pm on a Saturday and were promptly seated. Our order wasn't taken until 8:25, and we were told they were out of rice, so no more sushi rolls. We ordered an appetizer and our 2 entrees. 20 minutes later the server came back and told us that they were out of mashed potatoes. I asked about sushi again, and she said they now had rice. I cancelled my entree and ordered 2 rolls. Our apperizer and meals came out all at once at 9:25. The server comped our appetizer and one drink. This was by far the worst service we have ever received and won't be going back."
"3.0","Freshii probably deserves 3.5 stars (or 7/10) but since Yelp's starring system is out of five...The food is fresh and good. The location is convenient. And in spite of very long lines they seem pretty efficient about moving customers on through. I have three issues.For $10+ I would have hoped for a lunch that didn't leave me a bit hungry 90 minutes later. It just wasn't filling enough.Add-on prices should be listed with each item on the board! The guy at the till asked if I wanted 'protein'... Sure, I said. Whatcha got? The tofu sounded good, but I wasn't expecting $2.00 to be slapped onto my tab for a rather paltry amount that (see above) left me unfulfilled.The set-up is confusing. If I go back (and I'm torn on whether I will) I'll know better. But I felt as though I was obstructing other customers while waiting for my order until someone pointed the 'waiting line' to me that was not super-obvious. It would be nice if cashiers/order-takers were trained to tell customers where to wait.Also, it might be nice if they had an additonal sauce offering to Sriracha.Having written all of this, I still might consider returning now that I know how things work there."
"3.0","I decided to stop at CHiKN on my way home because I had an odd craving for fried chicken. The environment was pleasantly clean and modern for Oakland. The service was also friendly and their electronic table delivery system was smooth. The food itself was just ok, though. The heat all came from a dry rub. On the fries, this was fine, but it was unappealing on the sandwich when I didn't get any sauce or slaw in the bite. It tasted grainy. Overall, I'd come back if someone else wanted to or if I was in the area, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to visit again. PS - They don't take cash, only cards. I personally didn't mind, but it is an odd quirk"
"3.0","Easy to see why Cafe at Phipps was named one of the best museum restaurants in the US. The food is fresh, with options for everyone in the family and the prices are reasonable. one tip - if you order the red or green juice blend, be aware it is served at room temperature. The red was good, but I think it would have been even better if served cold. Next time, I'll ask for ice."
"2.0","Hadn't been here in a year since they overcharged my credit card. Contacting them after mistake I was issued a $25 voucher. One item ordered were wings which came with celery sticks, wings were ok but fatty, celery sticks were white and limp with one of them being blackened and looking like dirt on it. Mentioned to bartender but just received a shrug. Also ordered burger with sweet potato fries...fries were chewy. Men's and women's restrooms dirty with sticky floors. Surprised Jerome keeps his name on a place like this. The location is excellent beside the Allegheny River and in middle of a lot of activity but that's about the only positive in my opinion. Have been there about 4 times over the years and never been pleased."
"5.0","Their new release - the cucumber margarita beer, is awesome! I will definitely be back to try more."
"5.0","New ownership maybe 2 months ago. I stopped in on a Sunday, starving, not knowing what to expect since I hadn't been there in about 3 months. GADZOOKS!! This is a rockin' little market, friends! They now have a very useful and almost complete selection of grocery items, from mid-level to high quality. Such as: Peanut butter (from Jif to pure - maybe organic - brand of just peanuts). Jam? Dickinson's. Maple Syrup? Pennsylvania pure, no corn syrup fakies. San Pelligrino water? What flavor would you like? Some meats, some cheeses, Boars head cold cuts (for sale -Boars Head mustard, grey poupon, and another nice one I can't remember the name of). I got a 1/2 gallon of California Tangerine juice (not from concentrate) that is d-licious- and not really expensive. How about some Pittsburgh made chocolates (Lux)?  Prices are reasonable, when you consider the quality of the products. I'm not sure big bird is any less expensive on the same items (if they even have them!). So, almost a gourmet market, sans high prices or attitude! I'm using a lot of exclamation points, and I haven't told you about the sandwiches..... so, last Sunday I stop by to see what they're now about.Shelves are higher, more plentifully stocked, and a real nice deli counter towards the back. I ordered a pepper turkey and jack cheese sandwich, on rye, with LTO and spicy mustard. Ready in a minute, made your way (choose breads, veggies, toppings, condiments, or start your own creation) - sandwich is piled high with fresh cut Boars Head turkey, veggies are fresh and great, mustard is killer - I'd be hard pressed to make this at home! Awesome, at around $7.Went back Friday to take lunch back to work. Everyone loved their sandwiches. Healthy, fresh, made to order, quick, and reasonably priced. One guy who's a bit of a food snob (he cooks up a storm!) ordered the Reuben. When I asked what everyone thought, he said 'this place is a bargain. The sandwich was half the price of the deli on Smallman, and MUCH better'. All right, I'm done raving. I don't work here though it might sound as if I do. I want this place to succeed - no attitude really nice people with good food and pretty reasonable.Want some gripes for verification this is real? I have 2 - the website I pulled up for them is not current - maybe the previous owners?And, they sell great pickles - you should get one with your sandwich."
"3.0","I opted to come into Fernando's on a Thursday, when they have a lunch special of a 12' wrap or sandwich, fountain drink, and bag of chips for $7.50.  I opted for the lasagna wrap, which was mostly just intriguing.  The wrap contained meatballs, pepperoni, spices, and ricotta cheese, and mozzarella cheese on the outside.  The actual wrap was really dried out and kind of eh, but the ingredients inside were pretty good.  They have standard fountain drinks and iced tea, and there were lots of different chips to choose from.  The food was nothing special, but it fills a void.Fernando's is basically a local version of Subway, with some slightly different sandwich options.  The set up is the same, and the cleanliness is about the same as a Subway.  So if you are looking to help local business instead of the chains, check this place out."
"4.0","This was a nice restaurant that was very clean. I was greeted and sat in a very timely fashion. I was there around 11:30am which is lunch hour, and the service was very quick. We ordered from the menu and the food was out at our table in 10 minutes. The food was good, but the portions of chicken were smaller than normal, with a huge portion of rice. The egg rolls here are cooked excellently and very crispy. I would give the egg roll a 10 out of 10. I would definitely go back and have lunch again!"
"4.0","After having my high hopes of attending the grand buffet crushed by a long line of other hungry hopefuls all rushing the gates prior to closing, I decided to wander down to the wheelhouse...The wheelhouse offers a nice happy hour until 7pm with some good apps at half price definitely made for sharing! The menu items include a few items customized to Pittsburgh including Pittsburgh nachos which looked quite interesting.I decided on a burger and was pleasantly surprised by the taste.The only down side would be regular food items (like burgers or chicken) are a little pricy."
"5.0","Thai gourmet is my favorite place to eat in Pittsburgh. The portions are generous considering the very fair pricing. Further, they will refill your rice as much as you want when you dine in during dinner. All of the curries I've had were awesome. The general tso tofu is my favorite fried tofu, period. The sauce is amazing and the tofu is always cooked perfectly."
"4.0","Food was awesome (5 star worthy), decor great. Service not so much. My group were the only patrons in the restaurant, yet the staff seemed more interested in chatting than noticing we were standing there waiting. To their credit, they were hospitable when they noticed us."
"1.0","Very rude staff who insisted carding us even though we are both clearly of age. We had dinner at mezzo before and ordered a bottle of wine and we did not get carded. It appeared underagers were allowed in as they did not have any drinks but were permitted to hang out. Would not return however the view is cool."
"5.0","Sausalidos in my boyfriend and my favorite date place to go to in pittsburgh. We have been there countless times and all but one time it was 5 stars and the experience was great. The place is BYOB which is awesome, the menu is small but everything we have ever ordered on it was great. Our favorite thing is to get the brie app for starters.. just too good. The restaurant is kind of small, but they do have an upstair where they can seat you if you ahve larger parties. I mentioned all but one time our experience was superb. The one time it wasn't, we just happened to be there one of those nights when the restaurant got slammed with business and they were running out of food and customers were starting to get annoyed. For those of you that have expereience a night like that there, please give them another try. The owner is great and will do anything to make your experience there pleasurable and the food I really do love."
"4.0","Megan is the best waitress ever!! The foid was good, the beers were a bit pricey but it IS downtown. There was a cool trivia thing going on but unfortunately we had to leave. All around decent but megan really made it great!! Give that girl a bonus and a raise"
"4.0","Honestly, these burgers are delicious! First, you have to ignore the fact that it always is empty. In fact embrace it-and bring your little ones. Second, ignore the odd mish mash of decor; no-oddly loud music, pittsburgh team clad waiters, and vintage plates, don't really make sense. All in all-I don't know why it's empty, the burgers, the fried chicken, the Mac and cheese are all really good."
"1.0","no need to write long dramatic story. Beyond rude staff. Added 20% gratuity to a 4 person tab with service charge. Bartender cussed us out under her breath. Aggressive manager, yikes."
"3.0","Ordered a burger no mayo and wanted pickle slices too . Burger had mayo on it but assuming it was prepared correctly I did not see nor taste it until the 3 rd bite or so . Had a upset stomach for the rest of the night . Also the cheese on the fries was clumpy like the flour was not mixed correctly when preparing the cheese sauce . Wait staff was nice and love the ipa beer here that's why I gave 3 stars. I will come back but definitely checking my food next time"
"3.0","Food was pretty good but I was not at all a fan of the fact that they serve water in mini plastic water bottles, like what you'd find in a Costco multi pack. So wasteful!! Plus then it takes forever to flag someone down for more water. Just give people glasses like every other restaurant, it's not cute, just creating lots of trash for no reason & causing people inconvenience"
"2.0","I was hoping that this would be a nice place to have a few drinks and enjoy the outside evening air. Unfortunately, the beer options are limited. I was expecting a lot of craft beer options. There was Miller lite, dos equis, and other mass produced beers.It was very noisy with the roof closed and it was hot. They are trying to cool the area with multiple split systems. I didn't think it was effective and I was there at 9 at night.Lastly the service was slow. We ordered a first round. Once it finally arrived,we never saw the waitress again until I flagged her  down for the check.The good news is there are a lot of  options in this area."
"5.0","Really great quality tea. They also had lavender, a personal favorite that is not always easy to find. There are a good amount of food options and the environment is very cozy. Highly recommended if you're looking for a nice place to study with a cup or pot of tea. Came in on a Saturday afternoon and there were plenty of tables open with outlets nearby."
"4.0","Deliciously hearty breakfast foods served up diner style. Service and turnover is quick so you never have to wait too long. The crepe style pancakes are a must have. Anything with their signature potatoes is a must have. Juices are not fresh squeezed, FYI."
"3.0","This location offers good food and seems rather clean compared to other locations I have been to.  You can't go wrong with a Frisco Breakfast Sandwich for a quick cheap breakfast while on the run.  I reccommend this location if you are in the area."
"4.0","Quick mid-day bite while shopping on the strip. The best Bloody Mary ever! Add grilled jumbo shrimp! Was perfect on an unseasonably warm day. Accompanied by conch fritters, light batter, not greasy. And Thai chili fish bites, extremely tender with a light batter and Thai chili sauce with a slight kick. Portions was huge for an app. Service was fabulous! Our waitress was very attentive, it was busy and we were. It rushed. Decor represented the cuisine, seafood. Great menu choices. Will defined need to come back for a real meal to try out the other items."
"5.0","We love everything about this place! Their whole fish is to die for. Their tonkotsu ramen and robatayaki (especially wagyu beef and quail eggs), their sashimi bowls..Amazing food, great staff."
"2.0","I wanted to love this bar since I live pretty close but I was rather disappointed. First off its very small. Limited seating. The cocktails are good but pricey. Me and my friend waited and waited at the bar trying to get a second drink and we couldn't even get a bartender to look our way. Yes it was busy but that was no excuse. We ended up walking across the street to redbeards where we got served immediately. Oh and redbeards has food!"
"5.0","My friend recommended me to try this restaurant and I did not regret it. The foods taste authentic and the decoration reminded me of restaurant in Thailand. I ordered Hoi Jawh which I barely find any Thai restaurant in US serve this and it was so good. Pad kee mao was pretty standard, but they added a lot of vegetables in it which is a plus. Mango with sticky rice is so yummy too.*Warning* their spicy level is real spicy. 5 can really burnt your tongue out so get low level and ask for chilies on the side"
"1.0","I should say the food is good. But the management, staff's attitude and general organization is really bad especially if you want to go there as a group. We went there today with a group of friends and had a reservation for a big group. We had to ask for utensils multiple times. Some of us already had their food and didn't have utensils. My own food was kind of cold by the time I had them and I had to distribute them around the table for everyone myself since no one was doing it.We had a cake for a friend's birthday. They brought the cake after our food was over but they told us that we have to leave in 15 minute and they won't provide us utensils any more. We asked them why and their answer was ' we have another group coming by and you can't stay here the whole day' with a rude manner. We asked the manager to come after a little discussion with no outcome with the staff. He first had the same position till we told him about how the staff have been speaking to us and that they hadn't brought one of the orders after almost 2 hours. He changed his position and clarified that they actually don't need the table any sooner than 45-50 minutes and that we can stay at least another 30-40 minute and that we should stay. But at that point too many of us were involved in the argument and everyone was too angry to stay or had already left. Any way if they had told us in the first place we need the table in 30 minutes it wouldn't be a problem. Or that if they had politely explained the situation in the first place it would have probably been resolved. They need to learn that big groups with 25 people won't leave in 1 hour especially if they still haven't received some of their orders after almost 2 hours and that if they have such expectations they should clarify that at the beginning or at the time of making the reservation"
"3.0","Certainly not blown away by the food or service at Redbeard's. The company I work for had a gathering down here on a Wednesday, the wing night. My coworker was telling us how good their wings are, great flavors, fried nice and crispy, the whole nine yards. He went on to tell us that they have all you can eat for $12.99. Can't beat that we figured.My coworker called the morning of to set up reservations for a party of 15. By the time we all start to show up, we get there and nothing was ready to go. The waitress had to move tables around, move chairs, just so that we would be able to sit down. I was under the impression that this was why folks call ahead and make reservations, so that things can be in order when a large party arrives. Not a huge deal, but things get more interesting.The wings were decent. I was happy with the amount of flavors and and original recipes that they had, but that was about it. Our server was not very interested at all in providing good service to us. I know it's all you can eat wings and that requires a lot of back and forth, but if you're going to run a promotion be ready to handle the business. When it was time to get checks and leave, we asked our waitress 3x if we could have a take home box. Unreal. I know when you go to some places and you have a party of 8 or more, they add in gratuity. Not sure if that was the reason we received subpar service or what, but either way. Redbeard's seems more like that kind of bar that you stumble into just because you're nearby and want a drink or food. Nothing too spectacular here."
"5.0","Beautiful restaurant with a great menu and wonderful service. Went there for a bridal shower after they closed. They were very attentive, and incredibly nice. They had fruit platters and water ready, and everyone ordered their own dish. They brought all dishes over at the same time and it was all delicious. Don't skip out on trying the crepes, sweet or savory, they are who they excellent. Plus, the place is beautiful. Outside, they have multiple colorful umbrellas as a roof. Great photo opportunity!"
"4.0","What really sucks is that I have been in PGH for just over a year, and six days before I am to move away from this dive bar of a 'city' which is the capital of rednecks...i FINALLY find a decent taco.They even have a hot sauce that isn't some wussy american tobasco srachi no flavor bleh.Good taco, filled to the brim. $3 a pop though? That's why the stars are only four. I dont think ANY tacos should be more than $2.50.Anyway, adios Pittsburgh, at least you have ONE place to get a decent taco in this 'town'."
"5.0","An excellent lunch spot. Fast pick up, modest prices, BEST crispy eggrolls around. Good atmosphere inside and usually fast service."
"4.0","Can't vouch for the tea or food, but their iced coffee is really good. Friendly staff too."
"5.0","The food is amazing. Every time I have friends come to visit in Pittsburgh we come here. We normally get every small plate they have on the menu. While everything taste great, the dumplings are my favorite. A very relaxing atmosphere and the drink selection is great."
"5.0","I still dream about their croissants! So flaky and crisp. The best croissants I've had in the area."
"3.0","I hang out in Bloomfield quite a bit, but I had never heard of this place until a friend mentioned it to me and I went searching for it. Turns out I had been walking by it for weeks without noticing since the exterior is pretty plain and you can't really look through the window with all the plants and neon signage in the way. Or perhaps I'm just too short to properly peer in, but I think it has more to do with the former. Regardless, the exterior and interior are nothing fancy.Based on my friend's rave review of the restaurant, I had high expectations but ended up finding a lot to be lacking. First off, the waitress didn't ask anyone at our table for our desired spice levels. There was not even an offer of hot sauce or a spice rack to enhance our dishes, but then again, I didn't speak up and ask for one. I just found it strange considering we had ordered Pad Thai and curries. Secondly, the food wasn't as flavorful as I expected and the noodles in my Pad Thai were a little underdone.The other odd thing about our experience was the vegetarian option. Or should I say options? They offer vegetables OR tofu. The waitress was very confused when my friends asked for both in their entrees. Luckily, after some explaining, my friends received half and half. It's not necessarily a negative, but we had just assumed offering these options together was the norm. But you know what happens when you assume...Rather than be a Debbie-downer, I'll end with the positives of our experience. The food arrived at our table quickly. The portions are quite large and the prices are also slightly cheaper then other competing Thai restaurants nearby."
"1.0","Aside from the sub par Americanized Mexican food, the place is so small that you can't even sit down and enjoy your fake tacos. Do yourself a favor and look up Las Palmas. There are two of them within five minutes from South side. Another one in Washington and another in Oakland. If you're going to be forced to stand up and eat your tacos, you might as well go get some real tacos made by real Mexicans, not 'hipsters'"
"5.0","The smells coming from the stand are amazing - then the tacos are yummy and authentic. Love the Strip District eateries."
"5.0","Wonderful restaurant! 11/10 would recommend. I walked into Alexander's and was immediately greeted with a wonderful server, Jonathan Bright. Within no time at all we were served with bread and beverages. We were waited on at precisely the right moment and I was never out of water. The food was absolutely superb! Couldn't have asked for a better plate of pasta! Can't wait to come again!"
"2.0","Service was not good. The staff seems very disorganized. No free water.I came for a Sunday brunch with four others and while we arrived at a busy time, we were told to go to the back porch for seats, only to find there weren't any, and then redirected back inside to a table. Please have the courtesy to check for your guests instead of pushing them around!After sitting down, we examined the menu as we were handed small bottles of water. Apparently on the menu it said that these bottles were 50 cents each. I didn't want to be charged so I asked for tap water, but my bill on the end included the price for my water bottle, even though I did not open it.We placed our orders with our waitress, who seemed to be new. She was taking a while looking at my menu to write down the exact item names of what we were ordering. She almost hit me in the face with the menus when she was collecting them. She however was kind in handling our requests, especially when my friend kept asking her to refill the hot water in her tea. The food came out in maybe 15 minutes. It was decent, nothing too special or exciting. The portions were of varying size, the largest being the omelette. Not sure if the bagels were worth their prices. The salmon bagel itself had only one slice of salmon. The chai latte my friend ordered was actually a dirty chai. I thought the side salads were good though, and that the feta and honey crepe was interesting. I had never had something like it before.Overall, I don't think I would come back. The food wasn't outstanding enough for me to overlook the other problems I encountered. I do admit that the porch is very aesthetic, with all the colorful umbrellas hanging overhead. If anything, I think that will attract people looking for a good social media post."
"4.0","I love this place. Mostly for the experience, the hot towel, soft Japanese music in the background, the interior and ambiance. Japanese business men really do come here to eat and that told me already it was a good sign. The sushi chef is very professional. They have a lot of options and great prices. I really wish it wasn't located in Station Square because this is one of the top places for sushi in Pittsburgh hands down."
"3.0","I walked past Cafe Raymond on my stroll to DeLuca's and and decided to backtrack here to avoid a wait...First off, you smell the yumminess from this place as you walk by. Through the window, I noticed folks happily dining on breakfast foods and chatting a way. When we walked in, we were immediately greeted and given some suggestions for breakfast. You order at the counter and then seat yourself. The space is really inviting with warm wood decor everywhere, tables...counters, etc.The menu seems to have some tasty offerings but my main focus was on breakfast this visit. The menu is simple with options for your normal platter of eggs, meat, potatoes and toast or some sammies. They had a brisket hash that sounded yummy but a little too heavy for me that early.  I opted for 2 eggs over med, bacon, potatoes, toast. I had a chance to sample some of another meal at the table too which is always a plus Lol.  The bacon was thick and very smokey and flavorful...I just wish it could've been cooked a tad bit more. The fat on the bacon needed some thrashing of the teeth to separate, for lack of a better description. Eggs were cooked well. The potatoes had a boat load of pepper on them which caught me off guard.  Every piece didn't have that much pepper but it seemed like it was a steak type of seasoning on them. They were ok...didn't really enjoy them. Now, that ricotta blueberry pancake I had a bite of made me regret my choice! This thing was fluffy, light and full of blueberry goodness.  The maple syrup was delish as well. I could eat those forever but my thighs would object. I saw a trend with the waitresses carrying multiple plates of those yummy cakes to other tables too. The drink options were limited and we settled on OJ, not fresh squeezed but it served the purpose. Maybe I'm being a bit cheap but our breakfast came to $33.12. That seems a bit pricey for what we ordered and $7 for OJ, I dunno. I will definitely go back for my own pancakes and look over the lunch offerings next time. I won't say I'm passionately in love with this spot but it's worth a test drive for sure."
"2.0","To start, the bathrooms are DISGUSTING, with that being said I would never EAT anything here again.  This is a neighborhood bar for me.  I've been in here a handful of times, the crowd is never rowdy or out of control.  The bar area is clean and the restaurant has a very nice mellow atmosphere. I normally only drink Coor Light drafts which are 2.75!!! that's a lot of beer for less than 3 dollars.  I have had the wings in the past, before I saw what a disaster the bathrooms were.  They fry their wings to order and they come out hot and fresh. The patrons are a older work crowd, not too may youngsters here.  I have enjoyed myself here and will probably be going back again this weekend."
"5.0","We had a great experience here on a Friday night. Had to wait a few minutes for our table so sat at the bar for drinks. Friendly bartender made a great Moscow Mule. After we were seated for dinner, we ordered the grilled octopus, shrimp and shared a margherita pizza along with some red wine. All were excellent. Service was friendly and competent. Lively atmosphere. Would definitely come back."
"5.0","Delicious! Delicious! Delicious! We stumbled upon this place and decided to give it a try, and boy were we happy!  Super cute place. They make their own beer. Owner showed us the brewery downstairs. Just go and try you will not be disappointed."
"5.0","Today I tried the 'Old School' Sandwich..   - ham or turkey on swiss- let and tomato on a bagette with honey mustard or mayo.  Ok folks this sandwich was no doubt the bomb diggity!!  It was REAL HAM - not lunch meat.  It was safe to say I was the envy of many of my coworkers at lunchtime.  The sandwich was fresh and so delicious!"
"2.0","The beer is excellent with a variety in a lot of styles. My issue comes with the food. They don't have a large menu, looks like there's usually one featured entree and a small variety of sandwiches. This to me should mean that they knock these sandwiches out of the park. I ordered the Chicken Bacon Ranch sandwich. The fried chicken itself was solid. The cheese was maybe 10% of the way melted and tasted like an old velveeta slice. The bacon was extremely thin and looked like it was made the day before. The bun was just a plain potato bun that I would buy at shop and save. I was so disappointed in the sandwich. I asked the waitress about it and she said the chicken sandwich there is very popular and they never get complaints. Maybe I just had a bad sandwich but it's turned me off from ever going there again."
"4.0","Used to be Saleems so I stopped by. I had the chicken sharmola sandwich which was a good size and filled with well seasoned well-cooked chicken. The side fries were also my favorite, crispy and crunchy absolutely delicious. Don't let appearances fool you, Beta Bites is perfect for a quick lunch or ordering out. I should mention the staff was so friendly and asked if my food was good and if I needed anything multiple times when I sat in for lunch this week. Lovely local Mediterranean joint."
"5.0","Hands down the best beers from a local brewery we have had for a very long time.  Food was great, we will definitely be back to try more."
"2.0","Have been here several times and always had a good experience bit this past Saturday was awful.  Table for 5, place was really not too busy. Took about 20 minutes just to see the waitress for drink and appetizer order. Another 20-25 minutes for 4 beers and 1 mixed drink. No apps yet. When the appetizers finally arrived,  they were good, but dinner was disappointing.  Dry burger, steaks cooked wrong. Spoke up and saw the manager.  He did take off the burger and steaks but still left a bad taste for this place."
"1.0","Their spaghetti and meatballs gave me the sh!t$.  Enough said. P.S. The delivery guy stunk. He pretended like he couldn't speak English and could not come up to my hotel room. I met him on the street outside the hotel and discovered that he forgot one of my sodas that I ordered. I had to send him away with instructions to get me my soda.  I also explained to him how to deliver to a hotel room, which he did on his second trip.  Altogether laughable customer service."
"4.0","This spot could have easily just been a food truck. The vegetables and preparation were all top notch. Taste was good but the meat was very dry. If I was drunk, it would have been flawless. $3 per taco seems a bit steep but they have plenty of hot sauces. I went here two nights in a row since I was staying nearby. Quite a party street but pretty good for drunks."
"2.0","Kiku was one of (if not the top) most disappointing sushi places I've been to. Considering they're on the pricier side, I was expecting a higher quality experience than I actually received. We started off with the Tofu Steak which sounds fantastic on print but the dish itself was unimpressive. Essentially, it was a couple slabs of raw tofu drenched in a soy sauce - not horrible but definitely would not recommend. Then it came time for the main event - the sushi. I ordered the 16-piece vegetable sushi dinner which had a kampyo roll, a vegetable roll, and 1 piece of the carrot, mushroom, and avocado. I had to force it down simply because I didn't want my $18 to go to waste! It was equivalent to the quality of sushi found in grocery stores - but at least they have the decency to charge you $7 for it. Nothing tasted fresh and the vegetables were even browning. Pass! The one redeeming factor had to be their dessert. I am a matcha fanatic so of course I had to get not only one but TWO matcha desserts. I got the Matcha Cheesecake and Matcha Ice Cream - both were AMAZING! Although I'm not normally a cheesecake fan, this is definitely an exception. Highly recommend!The service was very spotty. Although our server was friendly, he was not as efficient or available as we would have preferred. There were very long stretches of time where we had to wait on him to return after asking him to complete a small task even though the restaurant was not very busy at the time. Not the most impressive display of customer service, but he did his job."
"1.0","Closed during business hours too many times to count. Like, go away and let us have a Chic-fil-a"
"5.0","I've gone twice since visiting here. The almond and chocolate croissant is absolutely devine! The croissant with vanilla cream and chocolate was also excellent. My poor waist line..."
"4.0","Not only have I been to Salem's to buy halal meat, but I've also been there to eat AND they catered my wedding! Because they were so extremely helpful in the catering, that's what I'll be reviewing them for (but also go check them out for lunch or dinner and to see their gorgeous mural!)Salem's was wonderful to work with in getting catering for half of our wedding. Due to having a mixed cultural wedding, we had our venue provide half the food (your typical boring wedding food) and Salem's did the Indian half of our food (delicious oh so goodness!).They gave us an absolutely full tasting with all of the aunties and uncles there too. Oh man, their chili chicken is sooo good (the hem of my wedding dress will agree because it got to taste some too when I dropped a whole bunch on it... whoops!). They were great and negotiating specifically what we would need and even gave a staff member to stay with the kitchen down there to direct them on not mixing halal food with non-halal food utensils. Instead of a Pittsburgh cookie table, we had a baklava table - it was a GREAT SUCCESS. Needless to say, all of our friends absolutely loved having this as our catering. Even if you're not Indian or Middle Eastern, you should definitely think about having Salem's cater your wedding or event if you want a very memorable meal!"
"4.0","We enjoyed a grilled whole fish and nigiri (sushi). I ate only three pieces of nigiri; hamachi, hotate and salmon, but all of them were delicious. Their fish are very fresh. Yakitori, karaege and Tonkotsu ramen were not we expected. There were only three choices of yakitori when we went there. Others from 'robatayaki' were vegetable and pork belly. Karaage was not Japanese karaage, more like popcorn chicken. Tonkotsu ramen was not an authentic tonkotsu ramen, more like a Chinese noodle.However, I gave Umami 4 stars because their grilled fish and sushi are the best among I ate in Pittsburgh. I will return to the restaurant for their fishes. And we are looking for their new sushi bar on the second floor, which will be opened around May."
"4.0","This place is awesome! Not much to look at from the exterior, or interior, but the service, food, and full bar exceed all expectations. Our server was warm, friendly,  knowledgeable, and efficient. My Bloody Mary was well made, and my Salmon stuffed with Crab meat was outstanding! The Key Lime pie was flavorful and a refreshing ending to a delicious meal. If I ever return to Pittsburgh, this restaurant will definitely be on my list for a return visit."
"5.0","Kiku was so effing good I took one bite and then accidentally punched my friend in the shoulder w my excitement while saying, 'This is so effing good!'Why do I ALWAYS forget about Kiku?  You must understand, I love sushi and it's not because I love drinking a whole bunch of sake before I eat the sushi, during, and after.  I go for the sashimi bc I'm not effing around w the rice.  If I'm dining w friends who say they like sushi but won't stray beyond a tuna roll, then I'll just eat regular nigiri w the rice but...bring me raw fish, on a wooden boat, and I'm a happy girl brandishing chopsticks.I am SO very tired of people talking about Umi.  Umi is spectacular and I love it, but there is other sushi to be had.  I've DONE Chaya and Sushi Too and Sushi Kim and Ginza (RIP) and Kotobuki and Ooshi Bento...  But I always forget about Kiku, and I think it's because its tucked away in station square.Newly rediscovered, I recommend you dine here.  Its beautiful inside.  They have one of the most sushi restaurant expansive menus in Pittsburgh.  Will sushi make your friend gag?  Bring them here anyway, there is so much to choose from, sushi or otherwise.The pricing is reasonable.  The place does not smell like fish.  You'll leave full, and happy, and you wont feel like your wallet has just been raped.There is a reason that Kiku has been around for so long, and that it has been nothing but consistent.  Good service, great food, & good atmosphere.  If you haven't been to Kiku in awhile, pay them a visit.Now I'm craving sushi and I just had some...."
"5.0","Been here several times- this place is a hidden gem! Homemade soy sauce, miso, great tempura and fresh fish- best sushi in Pittsburgh."
"4.0","Luke Wholey's almost goes unnoticed with all that to be seen at The Strip, but am I ever glad that we decided to sit down for lunch last Saturday afternoon. I'll say this, it was no cheap affair, three people each getting meals and drinks landed just under $100, but it was absolutely worth it. Service was also great, despite it being a rather busy day.I had the blackened ahi tuna sandwich and a Bloody Mary. The Bloody Mary was one of the best I've ever had, with a pickle and shrimp to boot, and the tuna was cooked perfectly.That atmosphere and location are ideal, and the food and drink this time around we're very impressive. The only negative I have is based on pricing, $10+ for a Bloody Mary is excessive, and the seafood and sushi is definitely priced at the premium. If you're willing to make an investment for a great meal, I highly, highly recommend."
"5.0","This is a great addition to the neighborhood. Fast pizza, very reasonably priced and excellent ingredients. You can get unlimited topping for 8 bucks...pretty hard to beat. An awesome option for a quick cheap bite in Lawrenceville."
"5.0","Good Food. Outstanding Service. A Classic. Alexander's is an old-school family restaurant/pub in all the best ways.The three of us (me, my wife and our son) arrived to a crowded restaurant that seemed to be filled with people who know each other. People hugging, laughing and talking. I assumed they were all together but it became clear that it was staff talking with various regulars - everyone seemed in a great mood. We sat and before we even had a chance to look at the menu our son was asked if he would like a plate of his own little meatballs. He was super excited about this idea. We were off to a great start. I ordered the chicken parm with a side of pasta. My wife had wedding soup with a make your own pasta combo. The kiddo went with buttered noodles with sauce on the side and the aforementioned meatballs. Everything was quite good. My chicken was crispy, but flavorful and the sauce was well seasoned. The real star of the meal was the Marfredo sauce - a combination of alfredo and marinara sauce. Its crazy delicious. I had it on my pasta side, the wife had it on her meal. Our son ended his meal with a bowl of ice cream and my wife and I split the Tiramisu. The tiramisu wasn't a traditional slice but more of a parfait. It was quite good. A lot of tiramisus are either drowning in brandy or the coffee flavor is overwhelming - this blended them both wonderfully. But while the food was good, the service was simply outstanding. Attentive, friendly and knowledgable staff.Give Alexander's a shot when you're in the mood for an old-school high-quality Italian meal."
"3.0","Went to this beer garden (my first one ever, if that's notable in any case) with some friends while waiting for a table for the meatball joint that is Sienna Mercato. Not going to lie, but I initially wasn't too thrilled at the idea of going here seeing some of the recent reviews. However, I didn't find it to be as bad as people were saying. For one thing, we went on a rainy day and they had the rooftop cover raised to help keep the attendees dry from the rain. However, I think they learned a lesson from those who complained on this platform earlier in the summer seeing as the roof was not completely enclosed this time around (thankfully), which allowed for the heat that comes from having so many people in an enclosed space at one time to escape into the rainy night outside. Service was prompt and at least from what I remember, I don't remember having any incidents with rude waitresses, people, etc.As for drinks, they have a nice sized selection of beers, wines, cocktails, and drafts. I ended up sharing a hard cider with a friend and found it to be quite satisfactory. They also have a decent size menu for appetizers and small eats, but taking one look at the prices ... yeah a little hard to swallow. Overall, it's an okay venue to share a drink with friends ... a little on the loud side, but that's to be expected in a place with a lot of people."
"4.0","The pizzas are affordable and customizable. There's definitely competition when it comes to pizza in downtown / uptown Pittsburgh, but Genoa holds its own. They even serviced me by creating a pizza with custom toppings and no cheese! That was delicious."
"5.0","This restaurant is awesome! Everything on the menu I've tried so far has been delicious. The coffee is good too. The folks that work here are really nice. My only issue is that the coffee cups are far too small."
"4.0","This was my first time here. When I was here in the Strip District last year, we had plans but we ended up in their fish market instead.Now here I am. I ordered the Panko and parmesan cheese breaded broiled cod. I also ordered the Peel and eat Baja flavored shrimp.I didn't expect these shrimp to be made cold. It has the Baja flavor alright but maybe I expected it to be steamed or something. The cod also was okay, tasted okay. My partner's order was crab stuffed salmon which he liked, though he said it was a bit overcooked. We shared an appetizer which is the calamari, and that really did hit the spot.I like the restaurants interior, with all those colorful wall painting, showing a carp and a giant octopus on one whole wall. It gives out a sort of homey feeling. Our server Tommy did a good job and was very attentive and I appreciate this.Overall it was a good experience. But I think they are too pricey. Would come back to bring family who visits, but will not come on a regular basis. It's just too pricey!"
"2.0","I have been to The Capital Grille probably 10 to 15 times. Most times I've been very impressed. Unfortunately the past two times were very disappointing. My wife and I visited in November for our anniversary. My wife ordered the filet cooked medium. They brought out a well done steak. Normally we wouldn't complain, but at $60 for a steak I expect top notch. Our waiter was great and immediately took it back and brought another in 5 minutes. Believe it or not it was also cooked too much! But it tasted good and they didn't charge us so we were happy. We visited yesterday for my Mother in laws birthday. I ordered a strip steak for $50. To be totally honest it was one of the worst steaks I've ever had. Very tough and chewy. I've had better $10 steaks at Ponderosa. I'm not exaggerating. I took 4 bites and threw in the towel. I didn't want to make a fuse being with my in-laws, so I quietly asked for it to be wrapped up. It's sitting in my garbage can right now. I don't know if they're sourcing lower quality meat or what. For $50+ steaks, they should be excellent. The service was great as always, but the food was just awful. Frankly, I won't be back."
"2.0","When they say spicy, they mean spicy. And I like spicy so that's OK with me. But that's about all I found to recommend this place. The fried rice that came with my meal was very dry and no vegetables were mixed in. I also thought the portion sizes were small for the price. I'm from Philly so maybe they just do it differently here. Its a shame there not more choices because this is the only place in this part of town."
"5.0","I have ordered from here a great bit during my last four years here at Pitt, so I was as bit disappointed when one day I got triple charged by Pizza Romano when a new employee started working there.  The manager, however, was quick and kind to resolve the issue when I brought it up and showed them the mistake that was made (and proof of the messed up transactions). This has been my go to pizza spot over the last four years, so I'm glad I got high quality customer service on top of great pizza."
"5.0","A very good burger, slightly on the pricier side (on the level of Burgatory) but better than most of the competition. The burgers are smashed-style, like Shake Shack or Fatburger. Staff is fast and friendly, and the restaurant is clean. Sides (fries and salad) are solid and very good, respectively. A good drink selection. On the quieter end of Lawrenceville so not quite as busy as some other restaurants in the area."
"5.0","I came today this caffe with my best friend for some good coffee and lunch, i had berries french toast with vanilla on top, it came with powder sugar and whipped cream, ingredients are so fresh and plate looked so good, my friend had holy crepe which is cream cheese and nutella melted in crepe top walnuts and caramel.. it was so good too, we both got latte, served wt cute mason jars. Place was pretty busy, servers are so kind and did a good job. We will def be back!"
"3.0","Now, I've only been to two different Thai places in Pittsburgh, the other being Nicki's. I did enjoy Nicki's slightly better, and I think they are a 4 or 5. So. Here we are. Service was pretty on par. Water barely was ever empty, and the food came out in under ten minutes after ordering. Which was awesome but at the same time actually kind of startling. We both had curry, I assume they prepare a  bunch of it in the back and just finish it up and serve it. Not that that's a bad thing, I'm not a professional, and I don't know proper curry preparation practices. Lol. So maybe this is normal. The flavor was pretty good; I'd say it was on the same level or a slight step lower compared to the other place I've been to. However, I did find the chicken to be pretty chewy which was a turn off, and my only real complaint. The lunch curry came with a choice of lemongrass or wonton soup. I got the wonton, good choice, it was wholesome and savory. It also came with a small spring roll. I will definitely come back here to try some different dishes! Oh, shit almost forgot. The Thai tea was great!"
"5.0","The better choice over many places in the Strip. Excellent food and a very proficient system to order, pay for and be seated, even when there are long lines waiting to get in. Even does BYOB for a $5 charge."
"1.0","Really waiting in drive thru with five cars in front of me for 20 minutes.   Sorry I'm backing up and going somewhere else"
"5.0","HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDGot the bacon-wrapped quail eggs, pork belly, and wagyu beef yakitori for apps and thought they were all well cooked and tasty. For mains we ordered: gyoza, okonomiyaki, takoyaki, ramen, and karaage. Everything was top notch. Fried ice cream for dessert was also really good, like mochi with a crispier/fried shell.This place has a great environment. Loved the interior design - great lighting and art. Pretty small seating area but plenty of room at the bar.Bartender was really friendly and the food came quickly. Great experience all around."
"4.0","This place has really awesome food.  It is a real college hangout, so it gets really loud on the weekend.  If you are there on a Saturday you won't be able to hear yourself think.  Also, the wait times for the food is ramped up, so it is extremely slow.  It's almost as if they only have one chef in the kitchen, which is a possibility.  For example, we were going to order a dessert, but by the time we were served and ate it was so late I didn't want to eat because I thought it might be midnight before I get the dessert.  Yah, if you have the time and the patience the food is really good.  Oh, the waiter did not ask my girlfriend for a spice level and when the food came out her dish was way too spicey for her.  So, that was a slip up on their part.  The service does need some work.  Maybe if you go on a week night the service would be better?"
"5.0","A cute tea shop with teas, sandwiches, and pastries! They have plenty of seating and friendly staff! I am not really a tea person, but it was a hot day, so I decided to give this place a try. The pomegranate white tea was light and refreshing. My mom ordered the strawberry tea lemonade which was good too-they make it with Minute Maid Lemonade. Next time I will try the sandwiches, as I was still full from brunch when I came here."
"4.0","The few lists that are out there with the title 'great new places to eat in Pittsburgh' weren't lying! Hubby, son & I had each gotten make your own burgers with the cheese fries as side & a chocolate milkshake. The shake was delicious, a little in the higher priced side but the shakes taste made the $7 well worth it. The burghers were cooked perfectly. Do not be deterred by how the cheese fries looked, the sauce looked bland & runny but was a little bit spicy & delicious. If there was one thing I had to say that was out of the norm it was the antique plates they serve the food on, in a more modern restaurant I found that odd. I will say that if the plates are the only thing I can complain about though, Burghers is a go!"
"4.0","It is a very good and delicious restaurant. The food was so delicious especially the yakitori! I love it so much and it made me miss Japan!! The atmosphere is the best izakaya in America I came so far. However, I think it is a little expensive for the yakitori. It is about $3 a stick. So I would rate 4.5!"
"3.0","This is a cute little spot. I decided to try the avocado toast, Nutella love crepes and an iced chai latte. The avocado toast wasn't bad. The bread could have been toasted more other than that it was great. The Nutella love crepes was amazing and so huge! Now the iced chai latte heard great reviews but it was literally iced milk with cinnamon powder a lot of cinnamon powder on top. Our waitress was pretty bad at her job, a person in our party was asking if it'd be extra to add some veggies to her omelette, she's like yeah like a couple bucks but the kitchen decided not to charge her but she couldn't even tell her how much? She gave us water bottle and she told us oh we usually charge but today they're free? We didn't ask for bottle waters at all but if you offer that and going to try to charge us why not bring out glass of tap water unless some one asks for bottle water? Parking was tough but I'd definitely come back for the crepes for sure."
"5.0","Good hotcakes, eggs and omelettes were good and so is the potatoes and coffee. The side of bacon was less than small and the western omelette came with guacamole paste from a tube or something. I was looking for real guac from a place this popular. That being said it is a good breakfast place on the verge of great if they wanted to take it there. The hotcakes could be better and dont really compete, but this is a good place and you cant go wrong here. Corn beef hash is the real deal."
"4.0","Color me impressed.  After reserving a table of 10 for a pre-show birthday dinner I started to wonder what had gotten into me.  I was going to pick the meatball joint, but 'no reservations' scared me away.  I didn't really want to go upscale, so Redbeard's seemed to be a good choice.  I started with several $4 Captain and Diet Cokes, so my evening was grrrreat.  But I also enjoyed our spring roll appetizer and my grilled chicken breast w/jalapeno & cheese wing sauce.  The sweet potato waffle fries rounded out a delightful bar meal and our service was overall good.  Keep Redbeard's in mind for a group meal. The upstairs is spacious and has a good vibe. AND they take reservations, which is a welcome change from the many downtown establishments which do not. What's up with that, btw?"
"3.0","I stopped here for lunch yesterday as I was looking for somewhere I hadn't been yet by my office on the East End. The place looks inviting and the staff is very friendly. The menu was nothing that knocks your socks off, providing several sandwich and salad selections. The nice touch though was the availability of gluten free buns. I got a Milano Sandwich on ciabatta and my lunch friend got a turkey sandwich on a gluten free bun. For me, the hallmark of a good sandwich has to start with the bread and this passed for us both. The ciabatta was really good and the meats used were fresh. That said, it was still a run of the mill sandwich. I've had better, I've had worse. They also have a nice selection of Hershey's Ice Cream which is typically very good (see my review for Scoops in Bloomfield). The one negative I did have is while the service was friendly, there was only 2 people working so things were slow for just two people ordering, but any kind of a rush and they might get overwhelmed quickly."
"3.0","I had never heard of this place, but based on the name alone, I was looking forward to a visit. The problem I had with The Summit is that I wasn't sure what kind of place it was trying to be. It had all the looks and feeling of a 'modern', trendy bar - with garage door walls and cool lights - but it really liked some sort of cohesive atmosphere. The The staff treated us like we were at a dive bar. They pretty much never came back to us unless we hog-tied them and getting a smile and anything less than an awkward shrug seemed difficult. This would've been fine if I were only paying $3-6 for my beer, but I paid $9.Also, the layout was odd. There was all of this space in the middle that could've been used for more cocktail tables. Overall, I wouldn't be against going here, but it probably won't be from my own suggestion. If they offered some appetizers or finger foods, then it might be more appealing. I think the service needs to match the look and then it would score a little more."
"5.0","Oh my gosh this place is amazing. Not too expensive as far as Indian goes & soooo good. I ordered the veggie, fruit & nut korma (Navratan Korma). It was delicious. Light spice. My husband ordered the chicken tikka masala and he loved it. Our friend ordered the chettinadu chicken with coconut milk. 7 out of 10 spice. She said it didn't have a heavy coconut flavor. She also loved her dish. All entrees come with rice. I also ordered yummy hot chai. I am in love with the place, dreaming about it. Every trip to Pittsburgh will include a stop to Tamarind. We went on Saturday at 5pm and parked on the street at the meters. We didn't put any money in the meter & noticed no one else did either."
"5.0","What a find!  Possibly the best burger in Pittsburgh.  Locally sourced ingredients, really delicious burgers in perfect proportions, amazing fries, and fine in-house brews as well as the best local beers.   Also features excellent service and plenty of non-burger options.  You can find larger burgers elsewhere but not a better flavor profile and reasonable prices. Spread the word about this gem in Lawrenceville."
"5.0","I live in NYC and was here in Pittsburgh at the UPMC hospital visiting. This was better than any Chinese food I've had in NYC. Our waitress was a delight. Great service. We ordered the spicy Szechuan chicken, the crispy spicy beef, and the combination fried rice. The crispy beef was ACTUALLY crispy and actually beef (not a mystery meat). In general the food was not overly greasy or saucy. Portions are very large- we brought a lot home in to go boxes. Restaurant is large and was not super busy at 7PM on a Thursday.  HIGHLY recommended!"
"3.0","Came here for restaurant week, and got to try the steak at Capital Grille.The starters were standard---can't complain about New England clam chowder. I do have to say the lettuce wedge salad was a bit...doused in dressing.The Dry Aged New York Strip sounded good on paper---my waiter told me they age their steaks for 18-24 days. However, when I actually tasted the steak, I couldn't tell if it was aged or not. Overall, it was a solid piece of meat, but could use some more seasoning. As for the filet---it came out way more raw than it should have. A rare looked like a blue rare when I cut into it, so I had to send it back to the kitchen.I'm not sure if the food wasn't as good because of restaurant week, but nearly everything else about the restaurant---wine menu, service, ambiance, are great."
"2.0","I was so disappointed in this place. My fianc√© and I had been looking forward to visiting and finally went today and it was not a good experience. The decor and ambiance is great, although for how large it is, I was surprised at the lack of seating. As we were looking at the chalk board menu the barista stepped over to the register to take our order, I smiled and said hi and she just stared at me. I ordered a medium hot vanilla latte made with almond milk. She just stared. I asked my fianc√© what he wanted and he just ordered a small black coffee. She asked if the order was together and after I said yes she asked me to repeat my order. I did, she then repeated back to me but she said iced instead of hot. I corrected her and told her it's hot. She put the order in and we waited. They called my name and low and behold theres an iced latte........I told them I ordered it hot and once again I got a blank stare and then was told that the slip says iced. I just took it but at this point I was too nervous to drink it. I'm lactose intolerant which is why I order milk alternatives and if they can't figure out the difference between hot and cold I can't trust them to use the right milk. We took our drinks and sat down at an extremely unstable table. My fianc√© quickly downed his coffee and we left. I left my drink outside in case anyone would want it since I was too skeptical to drink it. I'm giving it two stars because I like the ambiance and I think there's a lot of potential but the customer service was uncomfortable and rude. Not only were they rude but they made me feel very unwelcomed, as if I was bothering them. We were the only ones ordering and they weren't particularly busy so I don't know how my order caused so much confusion. I want to say this was a rare occurrence but I won't be going back to test it."
"5.0","Takoyaki. Sunomono. Okonomiyaki.If you think you'd enjoy saying those, just imagine tasting them.The menu here is a masterpiece; well rounded, inventive, and adventurous. You are encouraged to order bit by bit and try several small plates, and this is a great place to bring friends who don't have cooties to split and share your food.I went with a friend, and we sampled many wonderful things. The highlights were definitely the Nasu Shigayaki (pan fried eggplant topped with flavorful ground chicken) and the Takoyaki (essentially octopus hush-puppies).I love unagi, and it was on special when we went. It was prepared like a disassembled unagi sushi roll, with the roasted eel, nori, and rice in patty form laid out artfully on the plate.The cocktails were pure fun, with names like Godzilla Tears, Panda Panda Panda, and my favorite: Fizzy Lifting Drink! (the Willy Wonka reference works, since this place is to Japanese food what Willy Wonka's Factory is to Chocolate.)Please, if you like Japanese food or are an adventurous eater, try Umami."
"1.0","I ordered from Beta Bites through EatStreet since the Yelp reviews were good and I had a coupon.Worst mistake ever. Right from the beginning, the order was a disaster - the delivery guy made me walk across the block because he refused to get out of the car. It was freezing cold and all I had on were socks. He handed me the pizza through the passenger window and drove away without even an apology.I ordered their verdure (veggie) pizza which is supposed to be topped with 'marinara sauce, spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, banana peppers, roasted red peppers, mozzarella and provolone.' There were maybe 6 slices of tomatoes and a minimal scattering of spinach, banana peppers, and red peppers. I think there were all of 5 mushrooms on the entire medium pizza.On top of the lack of veggies, the pizza was awfully greasy. Even after patting down each slice with a napkin, I had difficulties getting through all of the oil. And the cheese - besides being tasteless - would not stay on the slice. I found myself picking up oily globs of cheese that had fallen off the soggy crust.Probably the worst pizza I've ever had in Pittsburgh.For the price, this place's pizza is DEFINITELY not worth it - you're better off going to pretty much any other place in Oakland."
"4.0","These hotcakes (crepe pancakes) are to die for. I just had the blueberry hotcakes this morning and I almost creamed my pants.   I obviously couldn't finish the whole thing or else I'd be in a food coma or turn diabetic from the rich brown sugar embedded between the layers or cream, butter, and magic, but it was one of the best breakfast pancakes/crepe variations I've ever had.  This is actually quite a big deal to me because I've had classic Paris crepes with Nutella, and this is up there on the 'omg you have to try it' scale.The quirky diner scene with checkered tables was a nice addition, and the staff is rather friendly. Apparently this place is crowded for brunch on weekends, but going on an overcast Tuesday morning at 9 seemed to work out well.  Anyway, if you're in Pittsburgh, you must try this place. For Shame if you have not!"
"1.0","This place is disgusting.  Went tonight with a group of nine and they could not handle it.  After three hours, the food they brought out was not what we ordered and it was all cold.  When we calmly approached manager she claimed we made her waitress cry and they were trying the best they could????    Then they abandoned our table and the wait staff began saying inappropriate things to other customers about our group.   At least two of the servers seemed 'out of it' it was obvious.   Avoid at all costs.  Very very bad.  And the food we did receive looked suspect, potential for health issues.  Next stop is city of Pittsburgh health department to file a concern.   Avoid."
"5.0","I can't speak more highly of our visit to the Capital Grille last night! We have eaten here maybe 7 times now and I have never been to a more consistently hospitable restaurant. To preface, I spent 10 years in the service industry and would consider myself to have high restaurant standards compared to others. My family and friends hate eating with me because I know what good service is and expect it (as should anyone paying to have a meal prepared and served to their liking). Now that you have the flavor of what kind of restaurant snob I am, let me tell you why The Capital Grille deserves five stars...When we arrived for our reservation, we were politely greeted and promptly sat. I saw the sign for their HUGE wine event and as a non drinker immediately thought 'ugh, I hope they don't hate us because we aren't planning on drinking.' While our server was still with her other tables, our waters were filled, an iPad to browse wines and desserts was offered and bread brought to our table. When our server Katie, whom I have never met, made it over to our table she warmly greeted us like we were regulars, using my name from our reservation. From there she fielded our questions and took our order.On her recommendation, I ordered the surf and turf which consisted of a Filet and African Lobster Tail (I had only ever had the Maine tail), the hubby ordered a Filet and of course we ordered the Lobster Mac to share. To start we had a crock of French Onion soup (truly the best I've ever had) and the wedge salad (always good until I remember how much more I like the soup) that we shared. I was almost full before our meals came!Our meals arrived, the presentation gorgeous, so excited to eat the biggest lobster tail I had ever seen! I cut into my filet, slightly undercooked but delicious. I'm a medium rare kind of girl so I'll take under vs over any day and I wasn't overly concerned because I had the huge tail and I could take the filet to eat the next day :) The hub's filet was cooked to perfection and the Lobster Mac was steamy and delicious as it always is. Now the tail... It was beautiful and from Africa so I couldn't wait! To my disappointment, it had a really fishy taste to it :( since I've never had an African tail before and had nothing to compare it to, I wasn't going to say anything. Katie came over and could tell I didn't love it. I didn't want to make a big deal about it but within minutes she had whisked that away and came out with what I know and love- the Maine tails. I was so impressed and my tastebuds were dancing with delight! After we were stuffed with deliciousness our table was cleared and scraped to the cloth. Katie presented us with a gift from the restaurant- a beautiful arrangement of 2 of their desserts and berries on a plate that had 'Just Married' written in chocolate sauce. Not only was it so incredibly thoughtful and beautiful, it was delicious! We were so excited and felt so special!If that wasn't enough, at some point during our meal Katie had asked us if there was a reason we weren't drinking and I shared with her that we just don't drink alcohol at all. I assumed she wanted to talk wines with us but she was respectful and that was it. After our dessert was cleared, she brought us over non-alcoholic sparkling soda with sorbet in martini glasses so we could have something to toast our wedding over!!! What an incredibly thoughtful gesture!!!!Our visit was last night and as I am writing this review today, I know this will be an experience we will remember forever. Some of these reviews talk about the weird decor or overpriced food but I promise you there is no dollar amount you can put on making your guests feel like they are the only ones there and that all you want to do is make them happy. My 5 stars clearly include the service, quality of the food, cleanliness of the restaurant and bathrooms and overall experience. Thank you Capital Grille for a night to remember. I look forward to our next visit :)"
"5.0","Yes. Definitely best in PGH. I go here evertime I'm close, or when I'm jonesing for it, which is at least once a week. It's soooooo goood. I always try the special. You can't go wrong here get whatever u want."
"2.0","Over rated. Nice venue but crepe with apples were very not very good, they didn't taste like anything. Also spanakopita was not very flavorful."
"5.0","We came here with a group of friends for brunch and had the BEST time!!! The floating umbrellas in the patio were everything. The food was DELICIOUS. I had the spinach and feta crepe with glaze (forgot the name) and it was heavenly. Everyone else in our party enjoyed their dishes as well. None of the food was heavy or greasy, it was all fresh and light which I absolutely loved. And you cannot beat the prices. Our waitress was quick with the orders even though the place was busy. The owners/managers came to check in on us multiple times and gave us free desserts and fruits which was such a nice gesture. I loved this place and we will definitely be back for more brunches!! Highly highly recommended."
"1.0","Absolutely terrible. Nice staff, awful food. If you want uncooked chicken wings, come here!!!! Mt. Wash location is legit, not downtown PGH. Avoid food at all costs, drinks are great"
"5.0","We loved this place! The service was excellent. We made a reservation in advance so no wait. I tried 4 of their house beers all of which were decent, 2 I liked more than others including the dad beer. We had the buffalo chicken rillettes which were different and very tasty. Then we had the crab grilled cheese with tomato soup and the haluski with kilbasa which we passed around. Both were very rich and filling but totally worth it. Overall a great spot with great service and yummy food."
"5.0","This place is so trendy it makes me anxious but it's well worth the visit if you are in town or you're a local. I decided to take my boyfriend there since I was craving quality sushi, particularly chirashi. It's hard to find good quality sushi in any city, and I was still feeling a bit bummed that the Izakaya place I used to go to in Shadyside changed over to a ramen shop. (I heard it's still pretty good though, but no sushi at the new place.) So I ended up trying to make a reservation here, and probably a mistake to try to do it the night before Thanksgiving, but oh well. I was craving chirashi like nobody's business! We ended up just walking in and sitting at the bar. We arrived right when happy hour started so there were plenty of seats. They have two different house sakes. I recall trying both and feeling pretty meh about one, but loving the other. I wish I had remembered the name of the one I liked because I would totally try to buy some at a liquor store if possible! That's how good it was. The chirashi was truly amazing here. I wish they had had uni in stock but they didn't have any because it wasn't available or fresh enough, and I can respect that. I love how they serve the soy sauce in a pipette sticking out of the rice, though I had to ask for a second one. Everything about it was amazing... the quality and freshness of the fish, the presentation, etc. Service was friendly but not overly friendly or fast. It seems kind everyone has a kind of laid back attitude there. It was pretty chill. Very limited seating so be sure to book several days in advance especially if it's a busy time of year. Otherwise, if you want a seat, be prepared to arrive early for happy hour. The entrance to this place is kind of hard to find at first also. And you have to walk up like 3 flights of stairs to get there. I did not mind this (plus they have epic wallpaper on your way up) but I am confused as to how handicapped folks would get up there as I did not see an elevator anywhere? Definitely not an accessible friendly place, also b/c they seemed to have multiple high top tables and high bar stools but no lower tables, so not sure how someone in a wheelchair would be able to eat here, unfortunately. The bathrooms are also down 1 level, accessible via the staircase which is somewhat inconvenient. I can only imagine how many drunken hipsters have taken a tumble down there on their way to the loo, haha. I loved the decor in this place more than anything, and that includes the stairwell wallpaper and the AMAZING dragon head faucet in the bathroom. I must try to find where they bought that so I can get one for my house, cause it is just that cool. Anyway, I would totally come back here again (actually did one more time before I went back home.) My BF also enjoyed it even though he does not eat fish or seafood of any kind, but he loves Japanese food otherwise. Some of the stuff here is more traditional and some is more fusion-y, but I really love that they have options! 10/10 would return again!"
"5.0","One of the best Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh. The food is authentic, and an entree usually lasts me 3-4 meals . . . tastes amazing as leftovers. It is BYOB and has been a great place for meeting friends because it is very low-key and the service is great. We also get orders to-go, and sometimes get a treat like brownies with our order! I always recommend this restaurant to everyone who asks where to eat in the city."
"5.0","You order at the counter when you enter, then sit and wait for your food. Service was good though I don't like having to tip when ordering before I've even tasted the food or experienced the service. I ordered more than I should have. Eggs over beef brisket hash was excellent. The menu says fried eggs but you can get them scrambled instead. Also ordered the French toast which was a large portion of thick toast drenched in strawberry compote with blueberries. The flavor of the strawberries overpowered everything else. I considered ordering the blueberry ricotta pancakes but I can't eat dairy so I skipped it but it's labeled vegan which I don't understand. Good meal overall. Paid twice what I would have next door at Delucas but it was worth it."
"5.0","Fast service and fantastic food. Great spot to grab a bite and keep you going. Tacos were very very good"
"3.0","best wedding soup (to-go!!) in the city, good bar/pickup service...never was a regular diner in the restaurant but as I remember the food was good, not memorable but filling and great if you go w/ friends or family"
"4.0","All around great.The place is busy. I was expecting a wait but wow was the service quick. You get in line to order and then are given a number to take to your table. The service is fantastic.We had a lunch sandwich, a breakfast sandwich, and pancakes. Each item was crazy good. The croissant bacon egg sandwich was perfection. The sandwiches came with fried potatoes.The drinks were good.Fantastic non-alcoholic brunch option for the Strip District."
"4.0","Prince of India is such a delicious place. Located conveniently on fifth avenue.  That being said be mindful that traffic is limited. It's a great place to stop and have lunch if you're free for lunch. The buffet is pretty affordable. I spent about $10 and everything was relatively good. Even as vegan there options available."
"2.0","Extremely underwhelmed. I ordered the steak and ranch hoagie to be delivered at my overnight job nearby. The person who delivered it seemed nice enough and the food was still hot even after I let it sit before I started eating it for a few minutes which is a plus but after that it goes down hill.  The sandwich comes with fries on it Provolone, cheddar and ranch. I swear I've never seen a sandwich have less meat!!! It looked like they put 2 frozen steak ums that you get from the market on the roll added fries and cheese and called it a day, they didn't even chop it up which might just be a personal preference but I've  never seen it like this before. The flavor of the meat was just ok however I do think they put a good amount of cheese on it and the ranch was good it tasted homemade which I love. I may go back again if my co workers decide to get it but I will definitely order something else and pay for extra meat."
"4.0","Great lunch for a low price! I ordered the turkey bacon swiss wrap, and it was really good. I definitely recommend!"
"5.0","I walked in this place randomly this afternoon and ordered Veggie omelette/nutella pancakes, i was so hungry and omelette came with side salad that was all fresh mix greens, salad dressing was so good. Omelette was one of the best i had in a while. Nutella pancake is just mouthwatering! I live right down the street, it will be my fav place to go! So i ll see you guys more often!!"
"5.0","Such a great spot for brunch! Highly recommend the super divine Mocha French Toast (ask for some bananas on top). It's literally dipped in chocolate! The crepes, bagel sandwiches, and omelettes are also awesome. Also, one of the best cappuccinos I've had in Pittsburgh! Such nice staff and owners - truly a can't miss spot!"
"3.0","I just wasn't impressed. Maybe my expectations were too high. The food was bland and not that great. The meat was really fatty. My boyfriend and I were looking forward to trying the pork and they didn't have any to offer when we stopped in. The service and ordering system is kind of weird. It's set up like a bar but you have to line up near this register in the corner to order. So it gets very crowded over by the register when it would be easier to just take orders where people sit at the bar. I don't think I'll be stopping in again."
"5.0","Quite possibly the best steak I've ever had. The service is outstanding and though some may find it expensive, the quality of the food makes it well worth the price. If you are in downtown Pittsburgh, this is a place you definitely have to try. If you are a foodie like we are, you can't miss this place."
"5.0","I've been frequenting Salem's for a few years now and can't praise this place enough. The meats are well-seasoned and tender. The veggie options are really tasty too! The staff is attentive and super friendly and no matter how busy they are, service is always quick. Love this place so much!"
"4.0","I was in Pittsburgh for business in June and found this place. Nice place! Kind of a 'shot & a beer'joint that sells really good corned beef sandwiches from a counter in the back of the place. Corned beef was really good! What makes them famous, I don't know! They were not 'that' good, but well worth the money!! Check it out, but keep you expectations from getting too high..."
"5.0","Our favorite burger spot in Pittsburgh yet. In addition to their unique burgers, their chicken sandwich is equally delicious. Try their cocktails and local brews."
"5.0","Randomly meandered to this place out of necessity after exiting the Duquesne incline and holy heck was I happy about it. Lamb shepherds pie, pork dumplings, warm cider bourbon drink, and Elysian pumpkin beer. This place had it all. And when I say all I'm including Jenga and Connect Four board games. This spot is for real."
"5.0","My favorite Japanese restaurant.  Sushi is excellent, but the kitchen items are exceptional.  Authentic.  This place's chawa mushi, age dashi tofu, and katsu don are the standards I use to compare any other Japanese restaurant's food."
"2.0","This place has gone way down hill. I ordered the steak hoagie and my friend ordered the buffalo chicken hoagie and both hoagies barely had any meat on them. I told the waitress about it and she brought over the manager who told me there was nothing he could do about it and that the meat is proportioned out beforehand. They also charged my friend $3 to add lettuce and tomato to the large hoagie ($1.49 +tax a topping). Unless you want to eat a bread sandwich and overpay for toppings, I would try a more reasonable hoagie place."
"5.0","I've been coming to this place for a long time, but with the Greenfield bridge out it had been a while. Stopped by today with my son and his buddy after a soccer match...glad we did! Friendly service, and terrific pizza! Hey, the garlic toast with cheese was pretty darn good too! They have a great selection of soft drinks and beer you can choose from as well, and take out. Even ice cream for after!Everyone always talks about Mineo's this and Aiello's that when it comes to pizza in the Squirrel Hill and Greenfield area.I'll take Rialto over them, everytime!"
"4.0","The Capital Grille is by far one of the best dining experiences I've ever had.  I have been here twice for large group luncheons and the food and the service has been impeccable both times.  The staff are attentive and gracious without being ingratiating.  I've actually not been to any other steakhouses in Pittsburgh (Ruth Chris, Mortons, Eddie Merlots) so I have nothing to compare Capital Grille against in relation to those establishments, but I do feel that even though Capital Grille is a chain that they do a great job here in Pittsburgh at putting their own unique style into this location and even though it attracts the high-end business/legal crowd during the work week, it doesn't feel intimidating because of the warm and comfortable decor. On this occasion our group requested to order ala carte from the lunch menu and they were more than happy to accommodate us when we asked them to be sure to reserve/make available the lobster mac and cheese and the bone-in filet for our group; two items which are not typically available during lunchtime.  We started with a few orders of the pan-fried calamari to share (we had a group of 15), and for my meal I ordered a caesar salad and the bone-in filet.  Our group also shared a couple of orders the lobster mac and cheese as a side dish.  I asked for the chef's recommended temperature on the filet and ordered it with the porcini rub and it was very tender and flavorful.  The lobster mac and cheese was perfect with large chunks of sweet lobster and the perfect amount of creaminess/cheesiness!  None of our group had any complaints and we all went home with doggie bags (or dessert to go) and happy bellies!  I would love to go to Capital Grille again for a more intimate dining experience with a smaller group of people, but I am looking forward to the next time that our bosses decide to take our group out to lunch there again!"
"3.0","I would say this is the best option for solid Indian food in Oakland. It always satisfies my craving of some hot fresh classic Indian fare. Their buffet is great with a wide variety of options and even some non veg options. It is constantly loaded with biriyani, paneer, vegetable dishes, and chicken entrees as well. I have also come for dinner and enjoyed their food. The chilli chicken is pretty good and flavorful. The chicken 65 is just small pieces of chicken in a very red seasoning. Their chicken biriyani is standard saffron rice with chicken nothing special but decent. The chicken makhani is also creamy and tasty. Their dosas though are unimpressive compared to the size of Udipi's.  Overall, their food is pretty good and satisfies that fresh Indian food craving. Also a great place to get takeout."
"4.0","There is nothing I like better during a day stuck at work for breakfast, lunch and dinner than to figure out where to order food delivery. Dinner delivery options in Pittsburgh has gotten so advanced, it's easy to explore beyond the realms of traditional pizza and Chinese with the advent of Yelp, Grubhub and Postmates. I had ordered a quick work lunch from Beta Bites before and had eaten their falafel panini and fries with a couple wings. I loved their falafel taste but didn't love the panini compression of the sandwich. I would definitely order something falafel from them again, just not that. The fries were crispy and well seasoned, the wings crispy and good and served with ranch dressing. I had to add seasoning and hot sauce to the wings but the base flavor was good. Their food was good enough for me to order from them again. What had interested me about Beta was that they offer a lamb and rice meal that looked pretty darn tasty in their thumbnail pic. I wasn't hungry enough to commit to that order though previously. Fortunately, I had a chance the other night to order the lamb and rice. It was pretty epic for food delivery. I don't know too many places that deliver an authentic Mediterranean lamb dinner. The lamb was deliciously braised and tender and the rice was a surprising star of its own. Very well seasoned the lamb and rice. It came with the choice of two sides; I had lentils  and salad with their Beta house dressing. The lamb and rice was large enough to share, which was awesome, because I got to split and share their Kafta Morrito. Beta has a line of Moroccan themed burritos called 'morritos'(?) Is that a thing? Oh my goodness, their Kafta (middle eastern seasoned meatball) is crave-worthy. I. highly recommend the Kafta Morrito, the lamb and rice dinner  and anything falafel for food delivery. Though they offer standard wings, fries and pizza for the college neighborhood in which they're based, I think their strength is in their mediterranean fare. Their prices are super reasonable too.Sorry no pictures. I was too hungry."
"4.0","Very tasty turkey with Cole slaw and thousand island. Chicken noodle soup was pretty good too. I think this is the best deli I have found in downtown Pittsburgh. Very interesting sandwich choices. I will be back."
"4.0","I was looking for lunch on the North Side and happened upon Arnold's Tea.  Very pleasant atmosphere, great service and a really good roast beef sandwich with horse radish sauce.  Well worth it.Will be coming back!"
"5.0","Delicious skillet Mac n cheese- I only wish it was available as a sandwich side so I didn't have to make a choice between my two favorites. Uncle Butch's lemonade was really refreshing while enjoying the sunshine."
"4.0","I was a huge fan of the happy hour atmosphere! The rooftop beer garden is a great place to be when it's nice out. I met a group of friends for happy hour and we got there a little later than expected so it was just a few minutes before happy hour ended, but the ladies at the bar were still very nice and gave us our drinks and the food my friend ordered at the happy hour price which was appreciated.Their happy hour prices are very reasonable, $5 drafts and half off apps. They had a good variety of beers on draft to choose from. My friend got the crab and artichoke dip and I didn't really like it, but everyone else enjoyed the flavor. I personally thought it was a little spicy and you couldn't taste crab. Overall it was a good experience, I will be going back! I would like to try some of their other appetizers because I've heard good things about them."
"5.0","Love the cozy artistic atmosphere and diversity of people that frequent here. The berry French toast was the best French toast I've had this far."
"4.0","One of the better Indian restaurants I've been. We ordered a bunch of stuff and they were all pretty good. The Chicken 65 was okay, tasted mostly like chicken pakora. My wife order the Masala Dosa and that was amazing. I ordered a Chicken Makhani which tasted great as well. The rice portion was kind of tiny though. The service was nice. The price was reasonable. Overall, I'm a fan and I'll be back :)"
"5.0","Hmm, hmmm, good!  No wonder so many raves about this local chain. LOVE the stuffed pancakes. They are more like crepes stuffed with strawberries in my case. The addition of sour cream gives the pancake a tangy note. Other items were also good - sausage, bacon & omelette but nothing compares to the unique stuffed pancakes. We will be back next time we visit Pittsburgh!"
"4.0","Came here on a Saturday night with reservations at 9:45 pm. Important to note that the sushi part of the kitchen closes at 10 pm, so come before then to try the sushi. There was also a DJ making the atmosphere fun. My friend and I started off with the Robatayaki chicken and scallion skewers. It is a little pricey but was cooked well. Would be willing to try more skewers. I then had the salmon Temaki. I had never had Temaki before and enjoyed the freshness of the salmon. The presentation also made it with the pipette of Nikiri sauce. I then had the pork and shrimp shumai which were standard dumplings. My friend had the miso ramen and enjoyed it. Said it was pretty good for ramen in Pittsburgh. Finally we had the macaron desert which was a little overpriced for one Mochi and macaron but the presentation made up for it. It was very refreshing and a nice end to the meal. I definitely want to come back and try more of the yatai."
"5.0","I went here for brunch and was quite impressed and surprised it wasn't crowded at all for a Sunday at prime brunch time. I had a beer cocktail and shared a few dishes with friends, including the chicken fried steak, the scotch egg, and the Brussel sprouts and all were amazing, including the potatoes that came on the side of the chicken fried steak which were crisp and cooked perfectly.  The Brussel sprouts came with pomegranate seeds which were a nice touch.  The beer cocktails and other beer samples we had were also all delicious.  They have a few good options that pair nicely with brunch.  Their coffee is also delicious.  The server was friendly and attentive.  The ambiance is spacious and bright."
"4.0","I want to give this place five stars, I really, really do. But I can't. I should preface this entire review by saying that the food absolutely gets 5 stars. One of the best meals Bobby and I have had in PGH to date.Fortunately, they have valet service but unfortunately because of construction going on downtown it's a little confusing. You have to drive past the Capital Grille and the valet is on your right. When we were here last week, there seemed to be some sort of event going on so valet service took foreeeever to get our car back for us.We've been to this location a few times and every time, despite having reservations, we end up waiting in the lobby for a good 15 minutes. This is okay, and worth it for the food, but they definitely don't get you in right away, or at least not in our experience.Surprisingly, between the wait to get in and the amount of time our server took between ordering/retrieving our drinks, we didn't even order dinner until 9:00pm. This was sort of frustrating, considering our 8:15 reservations. I don't mind slowly enjoying a nice meal and I can dig the European trend of doing so, but at least let us put the order in and bring us some bread and our starters!On to the meal itself:I started with the butternut squash soup and it was amazing! Seriously one of the best (if not the best) butternut squash soup I've had, and I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to squash. Absolutely delicious and the perfect way to start a meal after coming in off the cold street.For my entree, I had the filet with some sort of gorgonzola crust and I-kid-you-not it was one of the best cuts of steak I've ever eaten. The preparation was absolutely fantastic. It was a perfect medium rare. The flavors of the gorgonzola crust and the small bit of sauce complimented the steak without overwhelming it. I cannot say enough how delicious this meal was!Pro tip: order the lobster mac n' cheese side. So, so, so good.At the end of the meal, we waited for awhile for our plates to be cleared. Service was just very slow that night. We noticed that our server had a very large party, so that probably contributed to the slower service. Every other time I've been to the Capital Grille, they have wiped down the tablecloths with the crumb catchers, and offered hot towel service. These amenities were not offered this time. Perhaps because our server was so busy? Or maybe the Capital Grille simply isn't doing this anymore? Not a big deal either way, but I noticed it and so I figured it was worth mentioning.Our server brought out dessert for us, since it was Bobby's birthday. This was lovely, but we also ordered an additional dessert (the one he really wanted!) but unfortunately, it never came out. Our server was very friendly and apologetic and certainly rectified this on the receipt, but we were just overall a bit underwhelmed with our service this time around. For such a upscale place, we hold this establishment to a higher standard.Fortunately, the food was so delicious (as always) that I'm only deducting one star for service. It is my sincere hope that this was simply a deviation from the norm in the service here. I know we've certainly experienced better at this location! We will definitely be back."
"3.0","Decent sports bar/restaurant. Not bad prices. Waiter was very nice. Had the fried chicken sandwich with fries. Nothing outstanding about the food but it was a decent meal."
"3.0","I had a veggie omelet here for a late breakfast; it came with a pastry and a little side salad. Honestly it is a good bit of food for the price, but I'd have preferred a bit less food and a bit less price. The omelet was ok but I wouldn't say it is the best that I've had and I wish they would have grated the smoked gouda instead of putting larger slices of it."
"3.0","Wasn't too surprised with the Sushi platter. The only enjoyable part for me was the Miso soup. It was really flavorful."
"1.0","My parents and I went to Kiku in hopes of having good sushi. It was a Wednesday dinner, and there were probably 4 parties (total of 13 people) in the restaurant. We ordered a sushi deluxe, two rolls, a sashimi platter, and a sake. We were seated... for the next 1 hour and 20 minutes!  We finished our drink and complimentary miso soup, and no one bothered to check on us. The food was probably above average in Pittsburgh, but it certainly didn't worth 80 minutes of waiting. I don't know if they are under staffed because of the renovation, but the waiting time was ridiculous. I asked our waitress if this was typical (I hope not), but she lukewarmly said the chef was busy. Okay... I guess the unpleasant dining experience won't make me want to visit Kiku for the second time."
"5.0","While in Pittsburgh recently for work I found myself drooling over the pastries at La Gourmandine two days in a row.  First I had the quiche lorraine.  It.  Was.  Delicious.  Perfectly cooked, the crust was wonderfully buttery.  The size of one slice is pretty big, it was definitely a whole meal for me.  Of course I had to go back the next day (let's be honest, if I was still in Pittsburgh I would've gone back today too), this time I had an almond croissant.  Of course it was delicious too.  I'm sure next time I'm nearby I'll go back.  You should too. Try all the delicious things."
"4.0","Redbeard's has long been a place which I frequent. Since moving to Pittsburgh in 2007 I've been coming here (not sure why so many out of town people think its new, its far from new). They have a pretty good selection of beer. I wouldn't say they are a craft beer emporium or anything like that, but at least they value brews other than Coors Light and Bud Light.Their menu has a pretty good variety of items on it. They do some more restaurant/dinner type entrees throughout the week as well. I would not say their wings are the best in da 'Burgh, but they are pretty good.They recently revamped their menu and increased their prices(having worked in the restaurant industry for many years I understand the need to do this), but it seems they took off some our favorite items. For that I have to give it 4 stars.They have a great outdoor seating area which is open almost year round. Others have complained about the loud music. I would agree. The music can be loud, but its  a bar folks!! If you want to watch the Pens, Steelers or Pirates play, you certainly can. Sit in the bar area and the volume is usually pretty loud.They have a nice dining room for a bar too. You can request to sit in the far back room if its a more quite atmosphere in which you seek.I recommend the chicken quesodilla or a burger. Just watch out, its build your own burger and they charge for each topping, but please, don't bark about the price. We all know you can make a burger at home for a buck or two(its one of the best money makers for a restaurant)."
"4.0","For Indian food around the Oakland area this place is pretty good. I went for a lunch buffet and loved the fact that the food maintained some spiciness. A lot of the Indian food places that I have eaten at so far in the area usually tone down on the spiciness. It had a decent amount of variety for an Indian place and was at a relatively low price. The mango lassi is a bit overpowering on the yogurt I can't complain if it's their style since it was still pretty good. If you go in for buffet, I would definitely recommend this place. As for dinner, I have no clue yet."
"1.0","I visited Mezzo for the first time before the Pirate game.  A very disappointing experience.  I ordered a brisket panini and it was 60% fat. When I showed this to our waiter he had no response.  He charged us for it and had no comment or apology.  I would never have thought a restaurant as pretentious as Mezzo would let this slide.We had 7 people at our table who won't be going back."
"4.0","Peanutz is a perfectly good neighborhood bar on East Ohio Street.  Their beer selection is adequate (basically all the American macro lagers, plus a few of the more widely-known craft beers, like Sierra Nevada), and their bar is stocked with the full gamut of booze (except ouzo).  Trish, the bartender, is a fantastic bartender with a hilariously sharp tongue.I haven't tried very many of the menu items, except for the chicken wings, which are a house specialty.  Everyone recommends the Four-Dip sauce, which is pretty good.  The Cajun rub is good too.Decor-wise, Peanutz is focused largely on Pittsburgh sports -- there are two large display cases with all sorts of sports memorabilia.  There's a handsome wooden bar in the front room, and a dining room off to the side."
"2.0","We were so excited about this place and crabfest only to be quite disappointed. Got reservations for outside, got there early and seated inside. Fine, we managed. Then we ordered King Alaskan crab, oysters, and the cluster of crab legs (they were out of the Maryland crab legs which was the main reason we went). Again, we managed. Then it took WAY too long for the oysters to come out considering they were raw. It took over another hour for the crabs to come out. And sadly they were nothing special at all. We spent $100 and came home to eat because there was not a lot of food and it was unexceptional. We will likely not be back and wouldn't recommend the crabfest"
"5.0","This place is a hidden gem and you should eat here even if you aren't touring the conservatory. We ended up here accidentally because the restaurant across the street where we intended to go was closed for a private party. All of the menu items are perfect for lunch - filling, but not huge and healthful without being annoying. I had a salad and sandwich combo. The salad was supposed to have chicken, but they forgot to put it on. When I asked one of the staff, she cheerfully apologized and very quickly brought me the chicken. I had my 10-year-old niece with me and she was able to find something on the menu (an almond butter and berry sandwich) that she enjoyed and I could feel good about giving to her. Right across the street (behind the other restaurant) is an access point to the Schenley Park trail where we went for a hike after lunch. It was perfect!"
"5.0","This is the best place ever!!! I had some regular spaghetti and it was so good! I recommend this by google maps and I'm so glad! My dad has a pizza and he loved it! It's very friendly and I would recommend this to everyone! This place is like pizza/pasta paradise! The good ol burg has a good restaurant called Little Nipper's II! If you see this tell then your pal mike sent you! Thank you for your food Little Nipper's!"
"5.0","Cinderlands is a great add on the lawrenceville! Their in house craft beer are excellent! And the food are on point as well! It is bigger than it looks, they have more seats in the back and a great gathering area upstairs if you are coming here with a big group. They have some board games upstairs if you are into board gams. The stuff are very friendly. I've tried the fried chicken sandwich and it was amazing. I noticed they do change their menu every once a while, i will definitely coming back to try some new items on the menu."
"4.0","I have been waiting probably over 2 years to go here.  I got a restaurant.com certificate about a year and a half ago, and just wound up going.  I have to say, I expected more (of a station square restaurant) but it was really really good sushi.  I can't complain one single bit about anything except that I had probably built it up too much in my head.  I think it was the lack of ambiance that let me down.  The biggest thing that sticks in my mind is that the tables could have easily been at McDonald's - they were cookie cutter boring tables with no effort to dress them up or make them match the Asian decor at all.  I'm probably being too picky.... We got gyoza to start, which was wonderful.  Then, spicy tuna rolls, Shadyside rolls (salmon/cream cheese), and Steeler's rolls (eel/avocado).  My favorite was the Steeler's roll, but they were all quite good.  A bit expensive for what we got...but...with the restaurant.com certificate, which I got 80% off at the time, we had dinner for 2 for about $25 including tip.  Overall, not bad.  I was not astounded, but it is some of the best sushi I've had in Pittsburgh.   I'd go back."
"1.0","Wow!!!! I can tell why there is a net 3 star review on this place. We were downstairs for dinner and decided to come upstairs for a drink.It took about 10 minutes for any bartender to wait on me. Possibly because I don't weigh 90 pounds??? Because the girls that just sat down next to me just mentioned how nice the bartender was for calling their group 'super beautiful'........ Now they're talking about 'chubby chasers.'Also some douchey looking guy tried to get my boyfriend to leave our table? Also because he doesn't weigh 90 pounds. Great place if you're 85 pounds tops. Clearly against overweight people."
"3.0","Just moved from Portland to Pittsburgh and I have been on the hunt for the perfect taco place to replace my favorite taco joint. Sadly I have not found it yet. Doce taqueria is a small little taco shop with an open kitchen. Window seating, counter seating and one table outside (holds about ten people total).Fun random decor but they had terrible music blasting the entire time. Could barely hear anyone. I ordered two carne molida. Ground beef, bell peppers, jalape√±os. I left the crema and cheese off. Decent size I think they were $3 a taco. All I can say I ehhhhh. The ground beef was left in big chunks. Wasn't seasoned very well, quite bland. They literally just opened a #10 can of generic pickled jalape√±os and put them on top. As a taco place, I feel like you should be pickling your own jalape√±os. Super easy and taste way better. The taco was sogging out. Tortilla was falling apart. So much fat dripping off, it caused a substantial puddle in my basket. They had a large selection of hot sauces but no homemade ones that I saw. Welp, still on the hunt for some good tacos."
"5.0","We finally got a chance to stop on our way home and grab pizza from the new spot on 27th Street in South Side, Crust Almighty Pizzeria and More.  For my tastes, it's the best pizza in the neighborhood.   The plain cheese is good but the Spicy Sausage pie is amazing.Going to have to try their Meatballs Deep pie next time."
"3.0","We've gone to Jerome Bettis Grille a bunch of times. We love sitting outside. The location is perfect. The food is however just so so, and the service is really slow. That's sad. Hope they can heed all of these reviews and improve, cuz they would totally rock it."
"5.0","There are quite a few reviews already for this place so I'll keep mine brief: Very nice atmosphere and excellent service can be found here at Luke Wholey's. It's a bit pricey but the rainbow roll that I got was outstanding. I also got a free appetizer by checking in on my phone with my Yelp App. I elected for the lobster bisque for the appetizer. It was very thick with plenty of chunks of lobster meat in most spoonfuls. Simply delicious.Although I can only recommend the sushi for now, I'd like to stop in and try some of their other seafood dishes. From what I saw on other peoples plates, the meals look superb."
"5.0","Joey is an amazing bartender! Our hot totties were perfect and he served us with a genuine smile and amazing hospitality!!"
"4.0","Stopped here after a baseball game for Pizza with the kiddos!The pizza was pretty good!Breadsticks were also fresh and tasty!Its a pizza shop, so there's not much else to report.They do sell beer (ToGo and for In-house).Seating for dining is minimal, but it is very clean!I'd def stop in again.Parking can be dicey, though  ;)"
"2.0","You know when food looks good but doesn't taste good?  We have a case of that here. I ordered the burger that the Wheelhouse is known for-The Wheelhouse Blue Burger. It had bleu cheese and horseradish added into the burger. It comes with a bacon onion jam along with tomato, onion, lettuce, and a whole pickle with fries on the side. I ordered my burger medium. When the burger came the patty was unevenly made so some bites you got a nice bite of beef and some the patty was thin. My burger was well done-no pink to be found. I didn't taste bleu cheese but you could taste horseradish. That was a nice taste. I then added the Bacon Onion Jam which came on the side. I liked the addition of the bacon flavor but the jam was incredibly sweet. Too sweet. My hubby ordered the Pittsburgh Skillet. It had kielbasa, sweet potato fries, onions, cabbage, cheese sauce and topped with 2 fried eggs. The dish was 80% sweet potato fries. There were only 2 small pieces of kielbasa. My husband picked through it trying to find more kielbasa only to come up empty forked. He left most of the dish uneaten. We ordered an apple tart for dessert. The tart was an inch and a half thick. It was dense. It was served cold. There was a thin layer of sliced apples that were limp. There was a small scoop of cinnamon ice cream on top. Then it had caramel poured over top. It looked pretty but the only flavor was from the cinnamon ice cream. We came. We ate. No need to come back."
"5.0","-This time I had the Gorgonzola and Truffle Crusted Dry Aged NY Strip Steak w/a cherry Cabernet reduction. The steak was cooked perfectly rare and was of prime quality. -Service is always at its finest-Lobster Mac and a la carte sides are all excellent-Cap Grille is overall an exquisite, reliable experience"
"5.0","i think i'm in love. i had heard about pamela's before and that it's the best place for brunch, but i hadn't had a chance to go until yesterday.i get inside and was not exactly blown away... small diner-style, cash only restaurant. but ok, at least it will probably be cheap right?the menu looks pretty promising... interesting choices, breakfast and lunch, not a huge menu but not bad. i decide to go with the feta and spinach omelet (with the potatoes), and my friend that went with me went with the crepe hotcakes.the food comes and i begin to dig in. bam. the magic occurs. the omelet was tasty and the potatoes were even tastier! i had a bite of my friend's hotcakes and was blown away.moral of the story, don't judge a book by it's cover. the food entirely speaks for itself and makes this place a 5 star worthy breakfast joint."
"5.0","When it comes to tacos, man this place got it right. Always fresh products, packed with flavors. Presentation is pretty good for a taco. Service is great. My always stop by place for tacos. Give them a try!!!"
"3.0","There are so many good thai restaurant in the area and i probably would not go back. The taste was not the greatest but the portion value was great! We came here on a Monday night didn't realize most place close on Monday. The thai place we were going to obviously closed on Monday otherwise I would be here. I saw it got good reviews so we decide to give it a try as we are not dressed like we are going out. So we walked in and the host welcomed us warmly and seated us right way. We ordered pai kee mow(maybe known as drunken noodle)like I always do. I've never been to Thailand so I cannnt say if it is authentic or not but this is the first time I see tomato in this dish. The chicken has weird taste too. So basically all I m trying to say is everything is great but the tase was not to my like. I see this place get pretty busy during our meal, so maybe it is good tasty to others.  If you do come here, be aware of the size, it is huge! Everything look like two servings!!"
"5.0","Stopped in here for a quick, late dinner on Monday night, what incredible tacos! Super quick and totally fresh. The gentlemen working was lovely, walking me through the menu since it had been a while since I'd been there. Tacos come one per order for $3 each. Choose between flour or double corn tortillas. They also have nachos, rice bowl, and walking taco option as well. The vegetarian taco includes house black beans, Pico de Gallo, lettuce, avocado, cilantro, and lime. My oh my, so very impressed with these tacos! The black beans actually had substance and texture, they held up, and you could taste all the various flavors and textures. All the ingredients were SO fresh. The tacos might have looked small but they were chock full of ingredients. Very filling. Tried both the flour and double corn, corn was the favorite. For meat options he first suggested the Carnitas (pulled pork), they smoke it in-house for 12 hours. He also said the Americano (beef) is a crowd favorite. My boyfriend loved the Carnitas, said the Americano was just okay. For four tacos and a water our bill was only $13. Awesome spot for lunch, dinner or late night (open until 3AM on the weekends). Not a full blown restaurant, you order at the counter and they prepare the food behind you. They have just enough seating for probably 10 people max. Awesome food, can't wait to come back for more!"
"5.0","No joke, this is my favorite bar in Pittsburgh. I love my indulgent burgher happy hours as much as the next guy (see: Burgatory), and The Summit is just on another level. (the top level? Ha! That was unintentional. Sorry not sorry.) The cocktails here are fantastic - - boozy but balanced, adventurous yet nuanced, and never disappointing. Seriously, it's been a delight every time. I've come here several times with my fianc√©e, and together we've sampled probably half the entire drinks menu. Our favorites right now are the Sex Tape, the Danny Darko, and The Great Outdoors... AND I still have yet to find a better old fashioned. :) I wish I took a picture of the cocktails menu so I could show you all just how varied and remarkable their selection is. Regardless, the knowledgeable and amazingly multi talented team will take good care of you, and will happily help you find your perfect drink. I bring all my visitors here and I hope you do too! Check out the summit!"
"4.0","Over the last 2 years, Prince of India has become my go-to place for Indian take out.  I've never gone there to eat at their restaurant, but the food I've ordered to-go has consistently been good.  They have a pick two vegetarian entrees which is what I usually get, and it comes with a large container of basmati rice and naan.  I usually get an extra order of naan because it's so good (the onion naan and the naan w/ cauliflower are especially good).The portions are always generous and the delivery people are always nice.  I order through grub hub and you can add your spiciness preference.  I don't believe their drivers have insulated pouches/bags for the orders so by the time it goes from Oakland to my place in Bloomfield, it usually needs a little nuke in the microwave.  But that's really no big deal, and I tend to like food that's piping hot, maybe warmer than most people.  Would definitely recommend.  :)"
"5.0","I've been meaning to try this place and finally got a chance to. It lived up to what my girlfriend had told me about the place. Atmosphere and service were great and the fact that it wasn't terribly busy made for a nice, calm and relaxing evening out.It's on the slightly pricey side, but the food is more than good enough to justify it, and some of the combination dinners will fill you up and then some. I ordered the Kiku Tetsujin Plate which featured a large, beautiful platter of a handful of delicious, delicious food.It's a wonderful gem in Station Square, a place that is a sea of ho-hum chain options. Skip the chains and come here instead."
"4.0","Service was top notch, and setting was even better.   I have no complaints.  Bring lots of money, though, in fact if you are even thinking of trying not to spend too much, this is not the place.  Wish I could afford to dine here regularly."
"4.0","A good place for a casual brunch with a large group. We were able to make reservations for 9 the same morning without a hitch. The brunch special is a great deal - you get to try multiple items for much less than their combined price. The menu is really extensive, with a ton of different types of crepes, sandwiches, French toast, omelettes and more. The food was pretty good; I appreciated the fresh, seasonal fruit on the fruit platter that came with the brunch menu (as an option), and my apple and Brie-filled omelette was tasty. Coffee was also good. Someone had their small dog on a leash; they seem dog-friendly. Nothing blew me away, but it was all good enough for the price!"
"5.0","I cant imagine another place to sit and drink my coffee better than Mona La Bistro in the neighborhood ! Amazing design, cool staff and beautiful taste. Always fresh and on time! I always enjoy this place. Love!!!"
"5.0","Seriously an amazing French bakery...practically brought me back to Paris. Literally everything is super fresh and delicious. I tried the chocolate croissant and the almond croissant. I had the ham and cheese as well as the eclairs. All so so delicious. They have specific hours so make sure you check that out before heading over. The fresh baked goods are flaky and made with real fruits too not any artificial jam. The line could get long but its worth the wait. The prices are reasonable. I would highly recommend this place!"
"4.0","Love Red beards. Been going to this place for years. Food is always good. Appetizers are the best. The FRIED PICKLES are the best I have ever tasted.  I normally go for the all you can eat wings on Wednesday."
"5.0","Stopped in for lunch with my Mom and had shrimp fried rice with a shrimp egg roll. Delicious as usual and we went at 11:15 am 10 avoid the lunch rush. Been eating here for years...never been disappointed."
"4.0","The coffee alone warrants a good review. It was so delicious, just a regular cup! My mother and I went for a lunch around 1:30, there were only two other people there so we were seated immediately. The server was nice but not overly friendly.My mom ordered the veggie and Gouda omlette and I ordered the goat cheese and sun dried tomato omlette. They came out quickly and were hot and fresh. Mine was tasty, but it wasn't anything that deserves a raving review. The salad on the side was nice as was the rustic crunchy bread!"
"5.0","Really excellent food, huge portions, good service. Nothing not to love.I generally either get the Red Curry or the General Tso's Tofu, both excellent."
"4.0","Went here for dinner with a group of 5 and had a nice experience, overall. The food was delicious, reasonably priced, and presented beautifully. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting to get away from the hustle and bustle of the downtown area and just have a nice meal. We particularly enjoyed the smoked Gouda appetizer and the egg plant Parmesan dinner. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was the service. Being a small European restaurant, I wasn't expecting all smiles and attentiveness, but our waitress was particularly rude. She tossed bread at us when we asked for more, hurried us out when we were just sitting around chatting, and seemed very annoyed. Maybe she was having a bad night? I won't let that detract from the overall experience and delicious food, though. Highly recommend!"
"5.0","Delicious Thai cuisine.   I've been here twice with colleagues for lunch and highly recommend this place.  I would definitely come here more if it were closer to where I work.  Don't be deterred by the tacky sign in front--it's all about the food.  Every dish I've had here has been great so far.   You can specify the spiciness of your dishes as well.  Wonton soup ($3.00): warm, soft wontons with chicken and shrimp in chicken broth.  Tom Yum Chicken ($3.00): lemongrass, mushrooms, chili, and lime juice.  It's a Thai soup definitely worth a try.  Cashew Nuts chicken ($8.95): chicken, onions, carrots, bell peppers, water chestnuts, snow peas, and roasted chili paste.  This is more of a Chinese dish.  It's delicious nonetheless.  Red curry ($8.95): roasted duck, tomatoes, bell peppers, basil leaves and pineapple in a coconut curry sauce.  Very delicious curry that goes great with rice.   Basil Leaves Chicken ($8.95): chicken, onions, bell peppers, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, garlic & chili.  Outstanding blend of spices with vegetables and chicken.  Be sure to pay for parking!  My colleague's meter ran out by about 15 minutes, and he got a ticket."
"5.0","I found an abdolute go to spot for everytime I am back home in Pittsburgh. I will now not come back home without coming here.  My friend and I sat at the bar since they are super booked (and I totally see why) and the bar service was perfect.We both started off with the Cloud - I creamy whiskey cocktail with peach and almond notes. It was delicious. The bartenders are also riddled with knowledge. Learned a bunch of Japanese whiskey trivia. Wagu beef skewers - what an awesome way to start off for food. It is skewer per order for o my $4.50 and is so tender and bursting with flavor. This is one juicy skewer. MUST HAVE: The karrrage  chicken is an absolute must have and it is so hard to come by even in Philadelphia. When I do find it, it has always been thigh meat which I do not prefer but I like karrrage chicken enough to put up with it. I think Umami uses chicken breast... so it's like Japanese Chick-Fil-A nuggets or popcorn chicken.  It is so delicious here. Salmon sashimi (3 pcs) annot go wrong with this as long as you like salmon. They do top it with the salmon roe which I am not crazy about. I'm fine with tobiko though so maybe next time I can ask if I can sub.Gyoza... another favorite of mine. Unami serves it differently (in a good way) than what I am used to seeing. When they bring it out, it is circular so it looked like a mini pizza. When when you up it over you can see that's where they deal in the filling. So it is like amazing stuffed stuffed breadsticks. Finished off with more cocktails (Tiki which is Jamaican rum with lychee and violet) and some 1.5 ers of Japanese whiskey variety. I will reiterate that bar service is amazing and perfect... for those sitting AT the best AND those just standing around waiting since there were no more seats. Most restaurants have this crazy 'no seats no service' which is absolutely ludacris. Umami has raised the bar... for bar service!Also... the restaurant is up two flights lol. Go through the door directly I  got of the street entrance door. The restaurant bathroom is second floor and dining is third ;-)."
"5.0","Just go for the hamburger. Everything here is amazing but this hamburger will change your life!Great food always. Even is the line is long - you'll be served quickly. Every single thing I have gotten is great. I wish they served pickles with the falafel- but when everything else is really good - I guess you can't have it all?"
"4.0","The chicken tenders were over cooked and tasted terrible. The chicken for the chicken plate was great. It had flavor and was moist. The hush puppies were just right. I was not expecting the crab cakes to be fried, that was a disappointment. Once inside the crab was terrific. Just wish they were not fried. It would be better if in the description it mentioned that they were fried. Food arrived on time. Food was still hot once it arrived. I would recommend Beta Bites, I just think they need to add more to description of how food is prepared. I highly recommend the chicken plate and would order that again."
"5.0","Sausalido was such an amazing surprise. My sister and I both have food allergies and they were absolutely perfect. Right in the heart of Bloomfield you can find the most delicious allergy friendly and vegan food with BYOB as an additional perk. Darla and Mike were great! Catering and special events too. You will not be disappointed."
"5.0","Generous portions and friendly service. Check out the beautiful back patio when it's sunny outside. Convenient to Children's Hospital"
"5.0","I love having this market 3 blocks from my house. It has all the essentials and more. And everyone is so friendly there. It truly is a part of the community of Lawrenceville."
"4.0","Medium to high end bar that makes very solid cocktails. I'm sure they would make you a gin and tonic if you asked but they specialize in upper shelf liquors mixed with house made ingredients in unique and in house cocktails. They make a very solid Manhattan, pour a nice selection of craft beers and have a chill atmosphere. Expect ~$10 cocktails ($6 during happy hour) and draft beers ranging from $5-15. Similar to Acacia on Carson with slightly inferior cocktails and less knowledgable bartenders. Highly recommended."
"5.0","This restaurant is such a great gem in downtown Pittsburgh.  The delivery is good, but it's even better when you dine in.  Make sure you get an eggroll and homemade plum sauce--they are the best in the entire world and I've never had anything like it anywhere else.  The chicken and broccoli, sesame chicken and garlic chicken are my go-to and are all extra delicious.  As others have said, lunch service is fast so you can get in and out on your lunch break.  We also get delivery quite often and it's always good and accurate and they are friendly on the phone.  Definitely give it a try!"
"5.0","First time visiting Pamela's. Enjoyed a hearty breakfast. The corn beef hash is a must have. Service was good and food was hot. Will definitely visit again when we travel to the good city of Pittsburgh!"
"4.0","The food here is 5 stars, but the wait is the slowest I've ever had.  After a half hour wait, it took about 20-30 minutes after being seated for the server to take our order, and drinks came out with our meal at least 45 minutes after ordering.  There were 2 servers and we had to flag one down each time we wanted something.I definitely plan on returning -- the curry is absolutely spectacular, and the the garlic naan, dal and masala chai tea were great as well-- but I'll be sure to call ahead and ask how busy they are."
"1.0","I unfortunately have to say that my wife and I agreed that both our meals served were the worst dinners we have had in Pittsburgh. I am pretty forgiving but this was not acceptable. Both meals were served barely warm. The decor was old 70's which could have charm but this didn't. The server was fair. Forgot to even bring us water after requesting it and didn't ask how the dinners were. Both plates were mediocre at best. I will not return."
"5.0","Best biscotti in PGH, hands down!Once upon a time, long, long ago, my former lab manager, who lives in Bloomfield, brought in some treats from this store.  Specifically, he brought in a lb. of biscotti and a half dozen peanut butter cookies.  Like the hungry wolves we are, my labmates and I devoured them post haste.  The cookies were pliable, moist, and rich, and the biscotti was even better than Enrico's (gasp!).  Quite impressed, I promised to check it out for myself sometime soon.Fast forward a year or so to this past weekend, and I finally stopped by while in the vicinity to pick up dinner supplies nearby.  I ordered a half pound of biscotti ($5), consisting of double chocolate, chocolate hazelnut, vanilla, and cherry.  Unfortunately, at the time of my visit, they didn't have lemon, which I tried and loved previously.  I also wanted to try the chocolate torte, but unfortunately, they were unable to remove it from the mold on demand.  The biscotti was as delicious as I remembered, justifying the trip.Service from the woman at the front (Maria, I believe) was super friendly and extremely apologetic about not being able to sell me the torte.  I'll have to come back to try it--based on the biscotti and cookies, I have no doubt that it's delicious!"
"2.0","Ya know that feeling when you are disappointed you just threw that money away? That's how I felt at Burgh'ers. Another overpriced / underwhelming burger joint jumping on the burger-craze train.The staff was all very nice. The food is all over priced, especially for the portion size. $13 for their standard burger. The guy next to me got his burger while I waited for mine, and I just assumed he bought the smaller $10 size burger. Well, you know what they say about assuming...The burger patty was pretty small and flat, but it was seasoned well. Nothing like you would expect for the price. Similar sized to a single patty at Five Guys. The restaurant also feels cold and lifeless. Not warm and welcoming at all. And with the concrete ceilings and no sound absorbing materials, it was very loud even with the small amount of people there at the time.Save your money and go to Five Guys instead."
"3.0","Grading the pizza here. Average. Good, but nothing special. A little overdone and cool when it arrived. Can't blame them temp on them tho, I ordered and had delivered by Grubhub."
"1.0","We asked to be seated outside yesterday. Waited 40 minutes and, no one even came to ask if we wanted drinks so we left. It wasn't even busy. Terrible service."
"5.0","Cafe Raymond has never ceased to amaze me. The cafe is so cute and clean. The service is wonderful. I had the Reuben and I am very picky about this sandwich. It was wonderful and the corned beef was thick but not fatty. My son, who is usually picky about his PB & J, was also impressed. Usually he does not like panini style pb&j but loved this one! The bathrooms are very clean which is hard to find in the strip. We will definitely be coming back time and time again!"
"5.0","We went here after going to the one in Harmony a few years ago (plus I bought a Groupon). There's pay street parking available. I had the Maggie's Farm burger, which was topped with smoked Gouda, caramelized onions and smoked chilies. The burger was cooked exactly how I wanted. I had a side of the rosemary fries and honestly, those stole the show! Perfectly fried and seasoned, I'm drooling thinking about them!  I loved how the food came out on mismatched China. The plates were beautiful and made me feel like I was eating at a relative's house :)"
"5.0","I am gonna keep this one short and sweet.I have not been dissapointed by anything I have eaten here. The wonton soup was a perfect balance IMHO; scallion pancakes are the best I have ever had and all of the entrees were a great blend of what you would consider 'standard American-Chinese' food and the restaurant's individual flare. This place rivals places like Sesame Inn. And I know I will get heat for saying that, but that is solidly my take. I have been to the Inn several times, and am actually about to go again in a few minutes.it might be the best prepared and most evenly-balanced chinese food in the city. I say might, because I haven't eaten at every place in the city. As far as I am concerned, it is the best. This isn't Asian Fusion, nor fine dining. 5 stars are given based on the quality of the meal...which is superb, and I think you will like it.Cheers!"
"5.0","Great cocktails (highly recommend the Old Fashioned) and fun bartenders! We had a great time here during our trip to Pittsburgh."
"5.0","I LOVE THIS SPOT!! We've been here over a handful of times and the food was delicious. Their saki bottles aren't extremely over priced and their food is more tapas style. If you make reservations you might be able to sit in the traditional Japanese room. But Overall the vibes and food exceeded my expectations."
"5.0","Twisted Ginger tea...Wow! The best ever. Happy Chick (Peas) Sandwich was fresh and grilled to perfection. Whenever I'm in town, Arnold is my go to spot!!! Keep doing what you doing!!!!Love the VG options."
"4.0","Lovely place, lovely atmosphere.  I drank a Moscow Mule, had chili lime popcorn and taco.  I will definitely return and tell others."
"4.0","Delicious dogs and fries. Organic grass fed pure beef with generous toppings and servings. All fresh ingredients. Burgers are plump and juicy full of flavor too."
"5.0","Tried this place at the suggestion of our daughter and was extremely impressed.  The bartenders are excellent and extremely knowledgeable about their craft which is sometimes hard to find around town.  These guys know what they are doing.  Great selection of cocktails, craft beers on tap, in bottles and cans.  The open air windows is nice to sit during the summer.  No TV's make everyone forced to have a conversation unless you have your nose in your phones. Try this place and enjoy the best bartender's in the city!   Garlic popcorn is also great!"
"1.0","First things first, 'Chicago' style pizza is not pizza, it's a gimmick. Some restauranteur came up with a gimmick and it caught on. Is it Italian? Even New York Pizza isn't considered true Italian. Thin dough, olive oil, fresh tomato, whole milk or buffalo mozzarella, and fresh basil. That's a true Italian gem.Let's dissect a Chicago pizza, why does the crust taste like biscuit dough? 'Nuff said. Sausage between the layers of dough? So you steam the sausage? Sounds disgusting when you think about it. Fresh tomato and any other topping and a sprinkle of romano on top. Basically a Chicago style pizza is a quiche, minus the eggs of course. It's American, and Chicago can have it.Four stars for little chicagos regular pizza!"
"5.0","The curry goat was amazing. Very tender meat and no unpleasant smell at all. The naan bread was a bit greasy but very tasty. They served pretty generous portions too."
"5.0","My husband and i had an amazing experience at Gabriella's. We stopped in for a late breakfast. He ordered the shrimp & grits. I went with a brrakfast burrito which also comes with a hash brown on the side. The burrito is huge and the total is less than $9. My husband's shrimp and grits literally melted in my mouth. Probably the best shrimp & grits I've had at a resturaunt and I've tried a lot of yuppie brunch spots. My only issue was my burrito was only supposed to have eggs, meat & vegetables. It also had lettuce and tomato on it which i found odd. I took it off and didn't say anything because it was still good.We were treated with extreme kindness and hospitality here.The menu options are great and they also have daily specials. On the day we went, at least 7 specials were offered.This place is a gem, a diamond in the rough. Excellent food, excellent friendly service.Hours are 5am-3pm monday-Friday. Inside there's a few counters to sit at and enjoy. Breakfast all day. Highly recommend. Definitely stop in and see for yourself. Lots of love is put into this place by the employees"
"4.0","Quick flatbread pizza for 8 bucks and unlimited topping. My sister and I shared one which was enough to hold both of us over for the night."
"4.0","This place is adorable and delicious. Small and cozy, but our party of four had plenty of room and did not feel like we were on top of each other. Most importantly, the food was delicious. The appetizer portions were slightly small, but the entrees were portioned incredibly well and were so, so satisfying. We had a great time celebrating a birthday here and will absolutely return, likely when they change to the next seasonal menu. The only reason I am giving four stars is because the service was a tiny bit slow, despite it not being a busy night, and we had to ask for our bread after our meal was served."
"2.0","I had the evening buffet. Fairly newly restocked but everything was extremely salty without distinguishable taste differences between dishes. The vegetable pakoras we're the saltiest and basically inedible. I would not return here."
"5.0","Great food and drinks. Unique appetizers. Tried the Rabbit Rillette, Deviled eggs, and the spinach feta dip. Our group all agree, delicious!! We Love the environment."
"2.0","Weird flow in this place. Order first, then they choose a table for you, then bring food out but you don't really have a server. Burger was big & fairly tasty but VERY greasy. Served with chips without any other choice. Meh."
"5.0","This is THE BEST Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh. The quantity is great, the food is extremely delicious, it's authentic Thai taste. We have tried all the Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh and this one is the best amongst all I terms of taste and quantity."
"5.0","I took way too long to try Peppi's! I went with the regular Italian and asked for it hot. The bread, as most have noted, was delicious! Good quality meats, provolone, lettuce/tomato/onion and Italian dressing were perfectly embedded in the soft, incredibly fresh hoagie roll. I was afraid this was going to be another Primanti's, but it's not! I am a fan!"
"5.0","Great food with some items you can't find at other Thai food places- try the nam prik. BYOB and cheap!"
"3.0","I stopped by here this past Tuesday afternoon with my father for lunch.  I had been to Peppi's before but it was many years previous and at their North Side location.  This location has a counter where you order off to the left as soon as you walk in.  The rest of the restaurant is composed of a number of different tables and booths, lots of wood and earthy colors and has some decorations consisting of Pittsburgh sports and Peppi's regulars.Both my father and I decided to get a regular Italian hoagie on this day and they were brought to our table within 10 minutes of us ordering.  The sandwich itself looked pretty good and consisted of genoa salami, rosa salami, capacola and provolone cheese all on a nice bun that was just short of a foot.  I also decided to go with the lettuce, onion and dressing that was offered to me but said no to the tomato. Overall I thought that the taste of my sub was pretty good although I wouldn't have guessed that there was two kinds of salami and some capicola in it.  The bread may have been my favorite part of the sandwich as it seemed to be rather fresh.  I could also see some people complaining about the bread to filling ratio here as there seemed to be a lot more bread than filling but personally I was ok with it.The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  The price was right and my sub was decent so why wouldn't I?"
"5.0","I think this place ties with Smiling Banana Leaf for good Thai food so I will compare it to that. That being said, they taste completely different. It completely blows Thai Cuisine out of the water. My wife and I enjoy the noodle dishes there, they are a little more sweet and saucy. Here, they definitely get a good wok hei flavor into the dish and the noodles come out a little on the drier side. That is a mark of better cooking technique, but sometimes you want a little ghetto chinese food vibe to your food. The curries tend to be better here in my experience. The duck curry is particularly good. I don't like the rice they use. The rice turns out a bit mushy. I prefer calrose rice with everything. The calamari and the papaya salad are delicious as well. The serving sizes are pretty good, enough for 2 meals. Regarding service, I don't think you can beat the experience at smiling banana leaf, but they are very personable and this place feels more homey, like a family business.tl;dr - everything is great except for the white rice"
"2.0","The good was very good but the services was slow, I know that they were busy, i will have to say the wings special was a great deal."
"1.0","Well... perhaps we arrived on a bad night.  The drinks were just ok, seems they used low grade alcohol with fine spices and mixers, not sure why.  But the food was rather horrifying.   We ordered the noodle bowl, and I love noodle bowls... except this was the worst I've ever had.  The broth tasted like luke warm used bath water, and the ingredients had no spice or flavor.  The bowl was DOA.  Then I tried the tacos, also DOA.  Our experience completely went against their reputation, so maybe one day we will recover from this and try this place again."
"2.0","Wait for table.  Long lines - this would not be a problem, but the food was eh.Perhaps if I wanted carbs and meat - but I ordered a Vegetable Omelet  with sliced tomatoes and toast.   The toast was great (see -- carbs) - It was a poor vegable omelet.  For a Breakfast/Lunch place I would expect much better.   The filing was Mostly Diced Onions and what seemed to be canned mushrooms, Some diced tomatoes, some diced green pepper. I uploaded a picture.   I ordered hot tea - while they gave me a place for my tea bag - it was a plastic cup (ever heard of a saucer?).   Then I had to catch their attention for my refill, which was not easy.  Yet the long line.... Hard to explain - perhaps if you want carbs and meat....  Perhaps there is nothing better for breakfast here."
"5.0","Summit is a great place to go for drinks! The bartenders are all the friendly and they craft cocktails are some of the best I've ever tasted!"
"3.0","Review Number 600 - I decided to take BJ out for a really special dinner on Father's Day.  He likes steak and seafood, so Capital Grille came to mind.  I made a reservation through open table.  When we arrived, the restaurant was very busy, but we were seated right away.  The decor is rich dark wood walls, extraordinary light fixtures, rich woven wool carpeting, and a few mounted animal heads and statues and old world type of artwork.  I am sure you get the picture.For drinks, BJ opted for his usual beer and I had a Cosmo.  We had plenty of time to study the menu.  We decided to skip the appetizers and ordered a C.G. Chopped Salad to share.  I would call this a kitchen sink salad, it was full of a lot of different fresh vegetables, served on mixed greens with house made croutons and olive vinaigrette.  I really liked the salad, very fresh and delicious.  The bread basket here is great, it offers some nice choices of bread.  For our steaks, I got a filet mignon.  BJ got the seared tenderloins with butter poached lobster tails.  We decided to share the grilled asparagus based on our server's recommendation.  BJ loved his meal and that's what was important on this particular occasion.  He shared his lobster with me and it was perfectly cooked.  My steak, however was over cooked, tough and very dry.  It's a sin to see a filet prepared this way.  Also, our server seemed to be lost and didn't return to see if our steaks were cooked properly until well after BJ was done.  At that point, I wasn't really interested in a new steak.  But, as a reward for my suffering through a mediocre steak, we were given a free dessert.  Not exactly adequate, if you ask me, but better than nothing.We got the cheesecake with seasonal berries.  It's described as the lighter, fluffier cousins of a New York.  Our server said it made with mascarpone and had a little crisp caramelized sugar ala creme brulee style, which was a nice touch.  The berries were raspberries, strawberries, blueberries and blackberries.  It was delicious.We did have a really nice evening out.  But it's a shame that it couldn't have been perfect.  Inadequate service and a shoe leather steak prevented that.  We might try C.G., again.  But we have had such perfect meals at Morton's and Ruth Chris', we should probably stick with them."
"4.0","Loved the chicken taco. Added the habanero cholula for an extra kick. I don't typically like avocado, but it wasn't overwhelming and the components of the taco with the warm shell made for an enjoyable bite. Great prices too!"
"4.0","You can't really have enough burger joints. That is a scientific fact. Burgh'ers really stands true as a Pittsburgh Proud local burger stop and I enjoyed it.Between the Pittsburgh-themed decor, the burrow-themed burger names or the fact that the majority of what they serve is locally sourced, Burgh'ers is really Pittsburghy. I got the fox chapel burger and I really enjoyed it. #TheBlend (50% meat, 50% mushroom) was unique and tasty. Really a great burger if you're a fan of goat cheese. The pierogies we got for the table($10) were also delicious, but the menu doesn't point out that they serve you 4 and they are fried. That is all fine, I'm sure I could've just asked but $2.50 a pierogi is expensive(even though they are also locally sourced.)  Kristen was a joy to have as a hostess as well, accommodating and friendly; Not to mention she stuck around to answer the random questions we had about the plates, owner, her preferences etc.All in all, good burger, good service, decent prices. Thumbs up."
"4.0","I could eat here every day.   If I had the patience of a saint and wanted to weigh 400 pounds, that is.   As far as breakfast goes, Pamela's has it covered.   The crepe hotcakes are amazing and they have a pretty good selection of hearty and delicious breakfast fare.   Everything is always well prepared, quick, and flavorful.   It's definitely got a diner feel and they turn tables over quickly, which is good because there is ALWAYS a line. There's really not a lot of room to wait, but people wait.   It's sort of a madhouse, especially if the weather is bad and people don't want to wait outside.   I'm more of a reservation girl and don't have a lot of patience for lines, but this is a place I'll wait for.  Prices are a it higher than diner prices, but not unreasonable.   Payment is CASH ONLY and I'd be sort of surprised to hear that they don't have a lot of people walking out without paying.  You have to sort of fight your way through the crowd of waiting people to the cashier in order to cash out."
"1.0","Don't go here. Cold fries, order made wrong, cold, and just generally not executed well. Seems that the kitchen needs quality control and the dining room needs management. Plenty of other places to get a burger... If you are going to specialize in them, you need to get it right. Or at least try."
"5.0","Another restaurant week, another visit to Capital Grille.  You really can't beat the price for the great food you get!Caesar salad, Filet w/Green beans and mashed potatoes, and cheesecake with strawberries.  Always scrumptious, always cooked to perfection. If you are interested in trying Capital Grille - Restaurant week is always a great time to go - great price for great food!"
"4.0","Stopped in here with the man while walking our dog down Carson the other day.  Loved the casual vibe - walk in, grab taco, bounce.  Since we were literally just walking by, we got the spicy beef taco.  Loved the corn tortilla option, nice balance of flavor, good quality.  I definitely will go back and try some of the other options.  I would love to see a shredded beef option :)Were they the best street-ish tacos I've had in Pittsburgh?  No - that will go to Las Palmas or Reynas.  But they are still really good and definitely the best in Southside!"
"4.0","There is no doubt that this place has great food. Their falafel is amazing, and they have some of the best pizza and fries I've ever had. It's surprising to me how underrated it is! The only downside is that every time I've tried to order delivery, they've either been unavailable, or said they weren't delivering at the time. Takeout is usually more efficient when ordering from here."
"3.0","Setting was nice near waterfront with many seating options and our server was awesome, friendly, upbeat, and informed. But the food was just Ok, decent, nothing too exciting (had the big house salad with steak and blue cheese dressing) and the sweet potato fries which were undercooked. Restaurant interior needs some repairs and refreshing, looks pretty beat up with torn seats, missing trim on baseboard trim, and such (in the back area that we saw)."
"1.0","I wish there was a way to leave 0 stars. If your not a drunk college student, don't bother looking twice at this place. This is the first review I've ever written on yelp but I felt I would help out anyone one else not wanting to waste their money or taste buds. Pizza is bland, over cooked and lacks everything a real pizza should taste like. NEVER ORDER FROM HERE!"
"5.0","Love spending time here. Their blended tea drinks are delicious (I love the lavendade and the Arnold on the green), as is their selection of loose leaf teas. I enjoy the food here just as much, though! The selection and pricing is sort of like a Panera, but local and better. The pear arugula salad is my go-to. The baristas/servers are very friendly, knowledgeable, and accommodating.I'm not sure if this cafe is conducive to going there to read or work, however. It can get a bit loud during the busy hours, and I think finding an outlet for a laptop would be a challenge."
"5.0","My first time trying croissant French toast and I must say the best French toast I ever had! My waiter was very welcoming and sweet she was prompt with accommodating everything I needed. It was pretty packed that Saturday but it's things to do in the area while waiting. If I'm not on my usual diet I would definitely go again when I'm visiting in town!"
"4.0","Not sure why this place has such negative reviews. Came here on a Saturday evening and our service was prompt and the food came out fast. A little expensive when compared to the surrounding bars, but it's an outdoor roof deck and you can't really ask for much more. The crowd was mostly young professionals. I would recommend this place for anyone looking to enjoy a drink outdoors"
"3.0","Shawrma was yummy.  But the parking here is a bit dicey if you use a wheelchair as I do (gravel lot, no dedicated ADA spaces)."
"5.0","Great staff. Food was incredible. We got Mac and Cheese, Spinach Feta dip, Mussels, and Tacos. The food was so good and four people had plenty to eat with the shareables. They have a great selection of different beers but they won me over with the cocktails. I got a perfect Old Fashioned. The vibe is chill and they even have some board games to play. I would definitely recommend The Summit."
"5.0","I will keep this short since are so many other good reviews about this place. The portions are large service is solid and the menu is tasty. Oh and one more thing, the pancakes are delicious"
"4.0","Always good food at a great value.  One of the few local joints that still charges reasonable prices.  BYOB helps too."
"5.0","This place was really good! I love Nashville hot chicken and this brings It too Pittsburgh! Decent prices for the amount you get. Fries are flavored good. Chicken is definitely on the salty side but I love salt so I don't mind. The medium is pretty hot which they told us at the register and I enjoyed it. The mild is good too for those who don't want much heat. Love getting a beer with chicken...great combo. Plenty of room to sit. Very chill atmosphere here. Good for a casual date or brining a group of friends for a cheap dinner and a walking around Oakland."
"5.0","My family and I visited for lunch during Pittsburgh Restaurant Week.   Our reservation was confirmed through the OpenTable app, and we were politely greeted and promptly seated upon arrival.  Although there was quite a difference in the restaurant week pricing versus the actual menu prices, service and quality were not compromised.  Unfortunately, the field greens and tomato salad listed on the restaurant week website had been changed to a wedge salad at the restaurant.  Since I don't eat pork or like blue cheese, I opted for the only other selection of clam chowder.  I never eat clam chowder (personal preference) but I was actually pleased with the taste and consistency.  For the entree course, we all ordered the dry aged sirloin with roasted pepper, fresh mozzarella, and arugula salad - wow!  My one complaint is that my steak was a bit underdone, but I switched with my brother who didn't mind a more rare steak.  The steak was a quality cut of beef, and the side dish was the perfect accompaniment.  For dessert, we all opted for the creme br√ªl√©e with fresh berries.  This dessert selection was another deviation from the online menu, but a pleasant surprise since it was absolutely delicious.I've visited other Pittsburgh steakhouses that boast the same quality and service as The Capital Grille, but none can compare to this experience.  My parents didn't stop talking about this meal for weeks, and even tried to replicate it at home.  Thank you for a great experience!P.S.- I've already booked a reservation for my parent's upcoming anniversary."
"5.0","Went here for lunch while walking around and it was amazing!!! I'm from out of town and the woman at the counter was super nice. She helped us choose what was a great item to try on the menu. If I come back to Pittsburgh I will definitely come here!!!!"
"4.0","I drove into Lawrenceville on New Years Eve and my Yelp popped up to tell me what good brunch places were in the area. Caf√© Mona La Bistro was at the top of the list and I saw a pic of the outdoor seating which I thought was cool because I'm always looking for places with outdoor seating in the summer. I checked out the menu and it seemed like a great place. It seemed to have a bit of healthy and comfort foods on the menu. I walked in and it looked like a nice little place. I grabbed a menu and sat down. A minute later the guy at the counter greeted me and got me a coffee and a mini bottle of water. I ordered the protein omelette which had Black Forest turkey, ham, and bacon with Swiss cheese. I asked for Gouda instead of Swiss and asked if they had sides to order. The guy didn't seem to understand me so I asked if they had breakfast potatoes. He said, 'Yes we have potatoes, do you want some?' I said yes. Waited about 15 minutes and they came to my table with my omelette and a plate of French fries with a Cajun or Old Bay seasoning on top. I said I wanted potatoes not fries but was told that was the only type of potatoes they had. No big deal, but I know not to order potatoes next time unless I want fries. I went to eat my omelette and noticed the omelette had Swiss cheese on it. I hate Swiss cheese but understand this is how it is on the menu so I know mistakes happen. They offered to remake it but I was in a hurry so I said I'll just eat it. The omelette was delicious. Would've been better with Gouda or the fresh mozzarella but even with Swiss it was good. Fries were baked instead of fried and they were good too. Only reason I gave  this place 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the fries and Swiss cheese. They charged me 1/2 price for the mistake since I didn't want them to remake it. I'll definitely come back again. One of the best breakfast places in Pittsburgh"
"5.0","I know I give this pizza 5 stars, but it isn't the best pizza I have had - bear with me.  Gennaro's has a huge menu, fast delivery and a lot of food for a reasonable cost.  That earns it 5 stars.  The pizza is really tasty, and as a new resident of Pittsburgh, I'm finding it challenging to find a pizza place that just bowls me over... still hunting, but this is the best so far."
"5.0","My friend and I stumbled upon this place a few months ago while we were on one of our annual girls trips. We really wanted a good brunch place before heading back home to Detroit, and after reading multiple yelp reviews we decided on this place because of the ambiance. We really wanted to see the umbrellas in person. We were definitely not disappointed. This was the perfect end to our trip, the food was absolutely delicious, as well as the side salads. Everyone there was very friendly and one of the owners Eto even gave us coffee for the road. Highly recommend this place!"
"5.0","Best Burger in town, surpassing BRGR.  Great fries, condiments, atmosphere.  Touch pricey but with their new build in Lawrenceville, it is what it is.  Great service as well.  Great creativity on the burger creations.  They even have a vegan burger for all those hippies who live in Lawrenceville that regret being vegan and need a good burger tasting fill!"
"1.0","This is one of the worst eat n parks in the area. Every time I'm here (been 10+ times this year tho I think I've finally given up) there is NO HOST, you stand up front trying to get seated , trying to pay, just a mess. The food is often luke warm and I even got sick  a few months ago on the salad bar. The servers are always disappearing so the service is horrendous. I have had to knock on the kitchen door to pay my check , go get a server off the floor to be seated, etc. it's ridiculous. Whoever the manager is here should be fired. Everyone knows good service is a tough business, but this is beyond absurd and way below normal eat n park standards. Oh---and never ANY silverware put out! No spoons at the salad bar, have to hunt someone down for a fork and knife-Get it together !"
"1.0","We work in the same block and decided to try it. We had heard it was pricey and it was. The burgers were small compared to Tsaros up the street in Bloomfield!and $2.00 more. I bought lunch for two and with tip it was $40.00. I had a soft drink which came in a can and was charged $3.00. Cmon have a fountain refill for $2.00. We probably won't go back and have past the word thru out the office. The only good thing I could say is the service was okay!"
"5.0","The Bus is our favorite football player ever! We were so excited to try out his restaurant when visiting for training camp. It definitely exceeded our expectations, and this was definitely because of our awesome server George! The service was awesome! I never had to ask for a refill... he even recommended beers that we loved. He certainly goes above and beyond for his job and it shows. You can tell he really loves it! I wish every restaurant experience that we have could be as great as ours was with our server George! We'll definitely be back!"
"5.0","I went here for lunch today after learning they have an all-day breakfast menu. My coworker told me about this place.  I got a bacon, egg, and cheese bagel. I had my choice of a plain or everything bagel. I chose plain. I also asked for my food to go because I only have a half hour for lunch. I've heard that they take a while to make your food even if you call it in ahead of time. I decided to just go and hope for the best. I was greeted by a sweet woman who took my order. They also have baked goods there, so of course I had to get something to try. I got the Oreo blondie. I didn't have to wait long for my food at all... Definitely less than 10 minutes. My sandwich was huge with generous amounts of egg, bacon, and cheese. I will definitely be back to this place! I can't wait for the summer time so I can try their ice cream. Overall, if you are out in East Liberty, you should definitely check this place out!"
"3.0","Maybe it's the jet lag, maybe it's because neither Mom nor I liked what we ordered. But I've gotta dock Cafe Phipps a star. My husband Rick and I had been away for a week in Hong Kong and my mom wanted to take me out to lunch when I returned.   Shame Mom and I normally love Cafe Phipps, and since Mom has a membership at the Phipps Conservatory, she comes here a lot.Anyway, Mom ordered the turkey meatball sub with a side of citrus coleslaw and she didn't like it one bit.  I think my mom forgot that she just doesn't like turkey meatballs, turkey sausages, turkey bacon, etc.  As for me, I went for the grilled vegetable wrap which was decent but wildly unspectacular.  And I should have ordered a side of that citrus coleslaw.  But nope, I went for the lentil salad.  I like lentil soup but I'd never had lentil salad before.And I discovered one thing...........I hate cold lentils!  Yuck!  I tried forcing them down, 'cos I don't believe in wasting food, but to no avail!So ya, Mom and I will come back, but now we know what to avoid here!"
"5.0","Absolutely delicious!! Very classic, quaint decorations and a nice, romantic place for dinner without being overly formal. Our server was so attentive, professional, and friendly. Both of us were very pleased with our food. I had the Seafood Devonshire which was very filling and delicious! Nice beer and wine selection as well. We were out for a date night, but there were also families with kids who were having a comfortable and pleasant visit as well. Loved the music selection too! Will be back very soon!"
"5.0","Honestly, I am really hard to please when it comes to food.. ESPECIALLY pizza. I have absolutely NOT ONE BAD THING to say about this pizza. It is absolutely delicious!!!"
"4.0","Burgh'ers is one part 50's throwback burger joint, one part hipster L'ville eatery, and all parts delicious. I like the fact that they locally source a lot of their ingredients...you really can taste the  difference in quality. On our recent visit, my hubby and I sampled a variety of their offerings. We started with the pierogie appetizer, which included four pierogies each topped with a mountain of caramelized onions. The pierogies themselves appeared to be fried, with a crispy outer shell and a delicious, soft, fluffy filling. They were a perfect pairing with those sweet onions. Were they worth the $10 price tag? Probably not. But still a delicious way to begin our meal.For dinner, my husband ordered the Maggie's Farm burger, and I decided to indulge with a custom pickle-brined fried chicken sandwich. My husband opted for the standard side of fries that comes with each burger, but being the mac and cheese fiend that I am, I decided to upgrade my side so that I could try theirs (I mean, if I'm going to indulge, I might as well go all in, right?) When my meal came out, I first thought that my waitress had made a mistake and put in my order with double meat, because my sandwich was comprised of TWO fried chicken breasts! But nope, that was not a mistake....their regular chicken sandwiches are just HUGE! And lemme tell you, it was a tasty sandwich! The chicken was super crispy and juicy and had the most delicious salty pickle flavor that stood up well against the rich, creamy cheese and other indulgent accoutrements on my sandwich. So good....and so big that I was able to save one entire chicken breast from the sandwich to take home with me for lunch the next day. As for the mac and cheese side, it was fairly basic, but definitely tasty. A lot of the cheese sauce pooled to the bottom of the bowl, so I had to stir it up with the pasta. The sauce was creamy and well-seasoned, but given that it was an extra $3.00, I'm not sure that it's worth the upcharge, especially considering the fries that come standard with a meal are delicious. Speaking of which....yes, I stole several fries that came with my hubby's burger and they were awesome. I'm not a beef eater, so I didn't try his burger, but he reported that it was cooked exactly as he asked for (medium) and was one of the better burgers that he's had in the 'Burgh. Yes, it's pricey, but I think the food quality helps to justify the price. On my next visit, I would probably skip the appetizer and the mac and cheese upgrade, which would allow us to get out of there for around $30....very reasonable! We'll certainly be adding Burgh'ers to the ever-growing list of places to get a good burger/sandwich around the area!"
"5.0","Delicious meal and Italian wine. I had the prosciutto salad and the linguine with chicken. My husband had the steak tartare and the walleye. We split the chocolate cake dessert. We really enjoyed the dinner here and the service was great. I would recommend to anyone."
"2.0","Very disappointed with the burger quality for both myself and my husband. Burgatory, BRGR and even Five Guys offer better made burger.I got the chicken burger, which was very dry. It's understandable that chicken can get dry, but usually with good toppings and sauce this can be covered up. But my burger was dry and the toppings were not enough to balance out the dryness. In addition, it was on the saltier side. However, compare to my husband's overly salted burger, it was not so bad. My husband got the Mexican topping burger. Although the topping and cheese was good, but then burger was sadly over cooked (medium turned into well done). The salt level on his burger was also twice as salty as mine. Although the service was nice and the place was clean, I am giving it an extra star. But sadly, we will not be going back anytime soon....unless they make some major changes.The price we paid was definitely for gourmet burgers but the quality was not there."
"5.0","Yes Yes Yes!! Great tacos and great service every time!  Also some days he makes chili relano  which isn't super cheap but his chili relano is absolutely amazing!"
"5.0","Went to a holiday party last night with food catered by Sausalido and I was very impressed. I believe there were 8 different small plate type dishes served and all were great. In particular, I really enjoyed the white truffled deviled eggs, Rosie's stuffed meatballs, and the beef skewers. Everything else was not far behind though. I would really recommend them to anyone looking for some more gourmet type catering and I really look forward to trying more from them at future events!"
"2.0","I am so bummed and disappointed that my Pamela's experience was less than stellar.  I haven't been here in maybe 10 years and it is not at all as I had remembered.We went on a Sunday and I expected a wait, which was fine.  We were seated within 45 minutes - which again, is standard.It's almost communal seating with how close the tables are.  They cram about 60 people in a space that was intended for 30, so be prepared to bump elbows with your neighbor.  However, I tried to not let this bother me, because I was expecting a phenomenal meal.I will touch on the service. They were busy, but our waitress was slightly cold and barely around. Again, I was willing to brush this off for the delicious food I anticipated.This was one of the most disappointing food experiences I've had in Pittsburgh. My boyfriend ordered the Tex Mex omelette.  It was average, but not restaurant quality.  The only thing that made it somewhat decent was sour cream and guacamole.  This average omelette was still FAR better than what I had.  His omelette is the only reason I'm giving them two stars.I wanted to keep it simple so I ordered the French Toast.  It had absolutely zero flavor.  I'm not sure how bread with sugar, butter and syrup can have zero taste.  To combat its lack of flavor, I doused those puppies in maple syrup.  After about a 75 second pour, I figured that could suffice and give this meal the kick it needed.  Somehow, this French Toast became a vortex and sucked up all the maple syrup, making it more sugary and less flavorful all at once. I ate about 2 bites and left the rest. It wasn't worth even trying to eat for absolutely zero taste.  I also had a side of Oscar Mayer microwave bacon for $3.Needless to say, we won't be going back for quite some time!"
"5.0","The buffet is great value. I love dosa and bisi belebath, Tamarind makes both very well. I've been here multiple times and haven't been disappointed even once. This is the place I go to whenever I feel homesick."
"5.0","This place has delicious food at an affordable price.  Salem's is a no frills cafeteria style restaurant.  it has authentic cuisine from all over the Mediterranean. Helpful staff and did mention how good the food was?  Great for taking the family out."
"5.0","After reading about this Pittsburg institution we had to try it! The portions are huge and get ready to run a few miles after digesting as the food is super greasy and rich but totally delicious. The strawberry hotcakes were amazing! The crispy edges of a thin pancake crepe were soooo good!!! Also we had the famous corn beef hash and it was impossible to finish, soooo greasy but full of flavor, just make sure to drizzle with hot sauce. We also ordered bacon, it was just OK so I would skip it next time. Overall this was a great diner, friendly and super fast service as well. I can see why it's so popular with the locals!"
"1.0","This place gets 1 star from me. I used do be a frequent customer about 2 times a month since I live down town and it's usually excellent. Well this time I got general tso, egg roll, crab wonton. General tso chicken was so mushy and the sauce was thick like it was left over from the night before. The crab wonton were so over cooked you could not rip them apart and when I finally did there was hardly any filling. Only thing that was ok was the egg roll. I called and complained because Chinatown Inn is expensive and since I was not going to eat it I wanted my money back. My Roomate got chicken Lomein and egg roll. She returned hers as well. Her Lomein was gummy and no flavor. We got back they were rude and accused us of eating half of it when there was 3 prices of chicken out of it and now in my garbage can. I told them to charge me for the egg roll because that's the only thing that's was good. They did but they were not happy about refunding us. Never returning terrible experience, terrible attitude about their own product."
"1.0","So here we are more than a month later and not so much as an apology or a refund for the wrong pies and the spilled soup.  I filled out the on line form.I even went back 3 days later for breakfast in the restaurant with 2 friends and breakfast was completely inedible. The manager took the check AFTER belittling us and being snide and rude when I told her that I had missed her call because it was conveniently during work hours. She told me the complaint was invalid and not believable and they had it taped....please review the tape.....soup spilled...person at the window was clueless and wrong pies ....all which was paid for.  I gave you way too many chances. Your food when cooked right is mediocre ...your staff is horribly trained. Your managers are unhelpful and you wasted money re- doing the banks vile eat and park...money would have been better used to teach your cooks how to make real eggs..not the freeze dried carton eggs that you use on the Buffet. IF....BIG IF we ever go to Eat n Park again it will be the Dormont one..the food is still not great but the servers there are friendly. HUGE Difference.  Please train the staff at the Banksville E&p..they need it Badly."
"3.0","Today I chose the 'Sandwich Special with your choice of meat topped with Swiss Cheese, Cole Slaw and Russian Dressing - with pastrami'   The sandwich had no shortage of meat what so ever and was 'good' but it lacked cole slaw and dressing and only had a little cheese.   All I could taste was the pastrami really.   I have had the corned beef before and its good too but I am more of a pastrami/salami fan.  Next time I will request the dressing and cole slaw on the side and just apply myself."
"3.0","OK, so this place gets 5 stars for flavor, but I HAD to deduct two stars for a very important issue, which I will get to at the end.We came here for a friend's birthday celebration, and it was the first time we had actually been in - I've always glanced at this place as I was driving into town through the Strip, and wondered how things were. The good news is that the food is super tasty. I think we had a shawarma and a combo platter with chicken tikka, falafel, and herbed rice. It was all very fresh tasting and well-seasoned. Like other reviewers note, the portions are quite large, so I think the combo was really a good idea for like 2-3 kids or 1 adult and 1-2 kids.The folks were very friendly when we ordered, and really made things easy for us when we were making up our minds. They brought out our food when it was ready, and that doesn't take too long at all. The cafeteria style seating makes it very practical to bring a big group and enjoy the food.OK, so the ONLY issue we had was that after we had all finished eating, I had to visit the men's room and noticed that it was a mess, with water and paper towels all over. I'm hoping it was just a one time event, which could happen to any place, and will definitely have to check it out the next time we have the opportunity to visit. If it's fixed up, I would definitely bump this place to 5 stars for the food - it is so good."
"4.0","My husband and I had been to a show at the Benedum. We didn't get to eat before hand so we were starving afterward. We hopped in to this place and asked if their kitchen was still open. We were seated quickly and given menus. There was SO much to choose from. We ordered some wings and a wrap. The wings were goosed in a 'sweet chili' sauce. I thought they would have a little bit of kick to them but they were very good. The wings were crispy and juicy. The wrap had turkey, bacon, cheddar cheese, and tomato with mayo. It was filled with turkey. It was very tasty. It came with a side of seasoned steak fries. They could have been abut crisper but they had great flavor. I would definitely go back and try other menu items. They had great food and great service."
"4.0","Delicious!  I highly recommend the Rosemary Fries, they were surprisingly light and had just enough seasoning.  The salad is great, garlic vinaigrette is very good. I chose to build my own burger with chicken, great portion size and the toppings were perfect.  Only complaint I would have is how long our food took.  The restaurant had plenty of empty tables and our table of 4 waited about 40 minutes for our food."
"5.0","Excellent Pasteis and Octopus.  It has a coffee shop atmosphere with delicious food.  Authentically Portuguese."
"4.0","Really liked the restaurant--affordable seafood but great quality, fresh ingredients!! Our waitress was very attentive and professional. We had a great experience and will definitely come back. Sushi was beautifully done."
"5.0","Thai Gourmet gets better with every visit. The restaurant has several amazing items on its menu that you won't find at other Thai restaurants.On my last visit, I ordered mo palo, sweet and savory braised pork short ribs, and nam prik, rice noodles served with fresh lettuce and carrots with a thick curry.The mo palo dish reminds me of Hawaiian shoyu chicken. The sauce is brothy, probably made from a mixture of soy sauce, sugar and other herbs. It is served with cooked egg (ramen style) and is delightful over rice! This was one of the best dishes I have had here at Thai Gourmet.The nam prik was also delicious. You get 4 neatly arranged rice noodles twisted into balls. The noodles are really well complimented by the fresh vegetables and curry with which it was served. This was a great dish!Explore Thai Gourmet's menu and don't be afraid to try new items. You won't be disappointed!"
"5.0","Fantastic neighborhood market! Excellent variety of items from beautiful fresh produce to locally baked breads & ice cream to salty snack foods.  Incredibly friendly staff as well.  A true asset to Upper Lawrenceville."
"4.0","Everything I wanted to say has already been covered in previous reviews, so I'll just leave it at this:OH MY GOD GET THE HOTCAKESSeriously, get them."
"5.0","Amazing food, atmosphere is phenomenal! Everything is so fresh, well seasoned, melts in your mouth. Wide range of food selection. Large bar. Bloody Mary is very well prepared & served. Finger licking good!"
"4.0","Overall, I'm a fan. The atmosphere is so trendy and lush, and the place was bumping even on a Sunday night. The menu was relatively small, which I liked. Some of the options include tenders, a sandwich, salad, or chicken and waffles. I opted for the chicken tenders with a side of fries and a drink. I went with the mild seasoning but there's multiple heat levels to tantalize all taste buds. In my opinion, the seasoning was pretty salty; but I don't typically over-season my food. The crinkle cut fries were just what I needed, though! CHiKN also has what appears to be a full bar, which was unexpected. After ordering, we were given a buzzer for our order. Whenever you choose your table, you dock the buzzer in the center, and it allows the food runner to locate you. Super cool!"
"5.0","This is my favorite lunch spot in the strip! It's a short walk from work and worth t no matter the weather conditions. They are always so friendly and such a comfortable atmosphere. The food is so fresh and very quick service. My all time favorite is the muffuletta!! It's is freaking delicious and huge! Their burgers are delicious salads are massive. I've never had a meal that I didnt love!! Highly recommend everyone to stop and enjoy this gem!"
"4.0","As a world-renowned food critic, I am often tasked with the responsibility of providing in-depth analyses of the different tastes I have experienced and correlating them with the aura of the restaurant to produce an all-encompassing review that is capable of being utilized by any consumer. However, I can only think of one word to describe Tamarind -- DANK. I ordered a samosa as an appetizer that was perfectly crispy and adequately soft yet textured in the center. My entree consisted of the 'Chicken Makhani' with a side of assorted breads. The sauce on the Makhani was perfectly thick and flavored and coagulated well with the rice to create easily assembled bite after easily assembled bite. You may need to wash your hands after this one, but trust me, it will be well worth it.-DM"
"5.0","So, I'm on my way out to California and one of the stopovers happens to be in  Pitsburgh. After fruitlessly searching for anywhere nearby that's open and fairly priced, I almost gave up hope, but then I found this gem of a restaurant. The seafood hoagie is an absolute must try- it was amazing. The reason I'm on my way to California, in a very funny coincidence is to meet my newborn nephew who's name is Gennaro!"
"5.0","A small family place with great food. They have huge portions. Highly recomended."
"5.0","I LOVE this place. I'm actually eating leftovers as I type this review. I've been here at least10 times... Always great food at a reasonable price with good service. There is one young woman who is typically our server when we go and she is always very contentious and friendly.I've tried the noodle dishes, fried rice, curries... all quality! My favorite is either the Thai Fried Rice with Shrimp or Pad Z-Ew, with a sweet brown sauce and thick rice noodles. Unless you are a competitive eater, you will have leftovers to take home since the portions are huge. I always have lunch for the next day (or a late night snack...)!I stick to the non-spicy dishes, but if something says spicy, it will be spicy! I've tried bites of my boyfriend's Tom Yum soup or curry dish and my mouth was shortly on FIRE. My only complaint is that the spice level is somewhat inconsistent. I am a huge baby when it comes to spice, so I usually do a 2-3 maximum. Sometimes it's fine, sometimes it's a little hotter than I would like. I should just stick with a one!"
"2.0","The info screen says they deliver but they don't. They direct you to call a delivery service to place your order. Wasn't difficult but was an extra step. The order was confirmed by the delivery service and they emailed the receipt immediately but the order was incorrect when it arrived. The chicken Lo mein was ok but overall lacked flavor. The wanton soup also lacked flavor and noodles were overcooked. The vegetable roll was excellent though. They also forgot the plastic silverware and napkins which I specifically asked for."
"5.0","Updated: I wanted to come back and give this place another star. I've come to love this place so much and their food is consistent every single time. It's become a staple for me. I love being able to order ahead on the app or online and pick up, which I recommend doing, because the line can get quite lengthy (I'm not surprised, considering the place is healthy AND delicious). I have a few qualms with the app but I'm not going to reflect that on this location. Consistency is important to me, and when coming here you know what you're going to get. ORIGINAL REVIEW:So.. star bonus to the owners, first off. Both times I went in, not only were they very friendly and present, they had recommendations ready to go, kept the lines moving, and were very proud of their hard work launching this storefront. The location is extremely convenient, however plan to get take out because there is little to no room to sit and eat, even the expansion of seating in the back. It's a tad embarrassing (as a host)asking a small group out for lunch and not being able to accommodate a place to eat, but not really having been in before, it's something I should've scoped ahead of time. That being said, I know they are a franchise, but hopefully some suggestions can be made. I wanted a wrap (no added protein) and soup. $16. They only serve large bowls of soup, no small cups as a side or a half wrap/half soup. I even still thought $8 to not have a protein added (extra $2) was a bit much, HOWEVER you have to remind yourself that these are premium, quality ingredients and that it is going to cost a bit more. I scrapped the soup off of my order. Now onto the food.. I ordered a Tex Mex burrito. The flavors in it were amazing. However without a protein I think it was missing that fullness to the meal and I was left a bit hungry after, despite the size of the burrito. Next time I would definitely get falafel or chicken to give it a bump, but I feel lukewarm about paying $10 for a falafel wrap when there's authentic Mediterranean cuisine downtown that has falafel for less. I typically circulate the same food places downtown weekly, and although I'll be back, I'm not sure I'll add this to my weekly repertoire of repeat restaurants that I rotate, only due to the cost and not being quite filled. However, the quality of the food and the flavor have kept me as a repeat customer."
"5.0","When it comes to Sienna Mercato, I can not choose a favorite level. To me they are all great. Mezzo is different because they take reservations (which is almost absolutely needed when something is going on in the CD), where as the first floor does not. Their menu tends to have an Italian flare that always suits my fancy in one way or another.From the small to large plates, I always tend to have a home run whether it's fish or a piece of beef. Though, salmon tends to be my go to since they tend to prepare it a different way every season.I have had two different tartares (salmon and beef) and they were fantastic.The desserts are always very scrumptious and they usually have a great variety to choose from.And the drinks O.M.G they are a must! Between the drinks and the wine list, I am always in heaven (it probably feels that way after a few drinks, but still)!The service is always attentive and very helpful. Never had a complaint in that department!"
"4.0","This is a pretty good Panera location, but it tends to get quite busy at lunch time when all the students come in. Still, great food, good coffee & pastries, and free WiFi; what more could you ask for?"
"2.0","I was in Pittsburgh and thought this would be a good place to eat. We got there at 4:30pm ordered nachos with our drinks. When the waiter cam back with the drinks we put in our order. Two burgers and a order of wings. The place was not that busy. At least two tables that came in after us was served their food. Now it is after 5:30 and still no food. Then they served another table. so I called our waiter over and told him we leaving. He just said OK, y'all are good."
"5.0","I'd like to counterpoint Paris's review by saying she's underaged and spiteful because they wouldn't accept her fake ID, which in itself gets a five star review from me because I can't stand drinking with children. Source: I work near there and it's literally anyone is talking about right now.As for my actual review? Top notch staff. That grilled cheese is fire. They don't have dirty plates because they're paper and/or boats and aren't savages who serve things out of them twice.Love this bar!"
"2.0","The service here was worse than poor. This is my first time here, so it could have been an off night. We had two different waiters which was an awkward mix up, were promised more guacamole after the waiter realized it was a stingy portion but never received it, and the food took an hour to come even though it wasn't particularly busy. Regardless, the food was delicious. I had the boneless wings with sweet asian sauce. They were super meaty and came out hot. Even though the food was good, I wouldn't go back given the rest of the experience."
"5.0","Probably the best chinese food I have had in the area. General Tsos was awesome! Definitely going to go back."
"4.0","This place is my go-to pizza delivery joint. Ordering via GrubHub, my delivery is consistently on time, accurate, and hot. In the many times I've ordered from Little Nippers I have never had a bad order.Their pizza is pretty tasty for Pittsburgh standards. Hoagies are on point!Their prices are really reasonable--they're a great go-to when ordering out!"
"4.0","Dig the ambiance, and the menu. It a huge menu and really reasonably priced. This was some of the best Thai food I've had in Pittsburgh. There's some places that claim to be Thai - this place IS Thai.I had one of their curry dishes, and my date had the fried rice. Both were portions were relatively large, especially considering the price. The spring rolls were fantastic too. If you're in Bloomfield or Lawrenceville, this place is definitely worth the trip."
"4.0","After a late night with the girls. We walked through the strip like zombies searching for something good to eat. The Yankees are in town so the strip was packed with tourists. Every breakfast place had lines around the corners so we flipped a coin and ended up here. We waited about 20-25 min for a seat. The restaurant is pretty small but they do offer a little bit of outside seating. The menu is pretty simple breakfast, sandwiches, burgers and salads. They didn't have a turkey burger so I went with the ciabatta and lox sandwich which came with a side of seasoned potatoes. The seating is very intimate by the way . All of the food coming out of the kitchen looked delicious especially the French toast.  It took about 15 min for our food to arrive. My potatoes were very well seasoned! My sandwich was ok. It had all of the essential items tomato, capers, red onion and cream cheese. I enjoyed my sandwich and for as busy as it was the customer service was great."
"5.0","I LOVE going to Tamarind. The food is always delicious and the staff is always extremely friendly!Their madras masala dosa is my fall-back. It's filling, delicious, and has huge portions! I always have enough left over to eat for lunch the next day.I would highly recommend this place for anyone."
"2.0","Stopped in for a beer after leaving a recent Pirates game early (it was cold!). Rather nondescript place, devoid of any personality--seems like they're going for an upscale sports bar vibe--but I think they just opened the week before, so I'll allow them some growing pains. Odd scene: they had sound on for Pirates game, then, as Bucs were two batters from closing out the game, they start blasting music? After Pirates game ends (as does the one song), they put sound back on for Pens game. Inexplicably, in last two minutes of that game, they again start blasting music? Weird.Anywho, after a couple beers, my buds and I headed out into the night. Don't think I'd come back on my next trip to the 'Burgh."
"4.0","I've been here twice and the food has been delicious. The meat shawarma platter was massive and very tasty. The second time I got the chicken tikka masala and it was loaded with chicken and had a ton of flavor. The employees are always very nice. I took a star away from the setting, but I don't think people are coming here for that!"
"2.0","Everything is kind of sub-par, except the pizza which might be good enough to be average. Eh."
"1.0","Walked in the room was filled with smoke. The person shoved a dog food bowl into my hand and said 'since you're with the con, you get this.' I asked what was good they said 'since you're from the con, lasagna wrap.' So I ask for that and they give me something about the size of a Taco Bell bean burrito covered in dry melted cheese. The combo had a bag of chips and a soda. Soda machine was out of ice. Lasagna inside was dry.Total cost of meal w/plastic dog bowl I got for 'being with the con:' over 16 dollars."
"4.0","Not only does this brewery have a great location and excellent beer it also has a delicious and creative menu. I was really impressed with both their IPAs and their food. The vegetable side dishes we shared as a group are fantastic and just about enough for a small meal. I also tried the Spent Grain Chicharrones with beer cheese which are my new favorite appetizer. I love that are sustainable and vegan- of course the cheese takes it up a notch so I would recommend enjoying that with it. My dining companions were equally impressed with their food offerings and I'll definitely be back to try more!"
"5.0","I brought my wife to Pittsburgh for the first time. She loves seafood and shopping so I brought her down to the Strip District. We decided to have lunch at Luke's. This was the best choice of the day. I had the cod sandwich and she had the lobster roll. Both of our meals were delicious. Additionally our service couldn't have gotten any better. Our server Drew really know the menu, he was attentive and he made us feel more than welcome. I strongly reccomend asking for him."
"4.0","Visited this restaurant for the second time since right after the opening.  My rating is still 4 stars.   We visited on a Sunday at lunch time.  Parking wasn't too bad -off street.   I decided to build my own burger and was pleased.  I love that the restaurant offers Red Ribbon beverages!!!    Coke in a bottle is also an option which is great because we were able to take it with it when we departed!!   My boyfriend ordered the fried chicken sandwich and was raving about it. He's a picky eater so it was certainly good.  I liked the fries.. they were a bit on the salty side but still good.   We will be returning.  Thanks Burgh'ers Brewing!"
"4.0","I ordered Vindaloo and Onion Naan. Vindaloo is extremely spicy for me. I thought I could ''bear'' it, but actually I couldn't! If you don't like spicy food, try other things. The waitress was pretty nice. She gave a small cup of Mango Lassi which was really tasty and helpful! Onion Naan was nice but a little bit greasy. Overall, I'm willing to try other entrees next time!"
"1.0","Went to this establishment a couple of weeks ago.  Ordered the boneless wings  which were $21.99.  Not bad for 20 of them.   However about 8-9 were very small.  Close to the size of a quarter.  Spoke to manager and mentioned that almost half of the order was the size on the plate.  Her response was that she too had small chicken wings earlier that day.  She casually said she would see what she could do.  Never saw her again and nothing was done.  Very disappointing customer relations.  Could have changed my experience, but instead the manager made it worse.  Waiter was great.  Manger was horrible and should get some training possibly in conflict resolution."
"4.0","This would have been a five star for the food, but I have to deduct a star or so for a crazy awkward process.   We stopped in for breakfast on a Saturday around 9.  It's fast-casual style...ish.  It looks like a fast casual setup, but then you discover that they have a sort-of-server who does some things, but not others.  To start, you go in and order at the counter.  The menu/pastries/specials are in a couple different places and it's a little overwhelming to choose quickly if there is someone behind you.  At some point; you are supposed to be given a number, presumably before you hit the cashier.  That didn't happen, so the cashier assigned a number, took our order, and then advised that someone would seat us with that number.   We were asked if we wanted inside or on the balcony, so at least that narrowed down the hunt when we went to find the table with our number on it.  When we found it, we saw that it was in a sunny corner.  I get it...it's outside and we asked for that...but if I'd been given the opportunity for input, I'd have picked one in the shade.   Anyhow, a server brought our food and checked in several times to see if we needed anything.  I found this weird for several reasons.  First, while she asked if we needed things, she wasn't actually going to bring about half of them.  We asked for water and were told that it was self-serve inside.  Ok - no problem - up we go.  Coffee was much more of a conundrum.  She came around and kept refilling, which then required us to keep getting up again and again to go inside for cream and sugar.  Why bring the coffee at all if you aren't going to bring the rest of it?  Just leave it all inside and we will get it at our leisure. Second, you pay inside when you order as if you are on your own from there.  Were we supposed to tip that limited service server?  She did bring the food and pick up the dishes.  No idea, but since we didn't have cash, we were a little stuck there.   All in all, the food was plentiful and delicious.  Not cheap for breakfast, but you get a lot for it and the flavors were good.   The process though was a little weird for me."
"2.0","Don't expect fresh food. We have taken ravioli and tortelini. It was fast, that's perhaps because of microwave. Never more."
"3.0","Plenty of seating area for all Panera guests! I can only imagine how many students visit this location during the school year since it's near the college! It would be nice to study in here since there are some quieter areas. We came to Panera for breakfast and ordered the steel cut oatmeal, power sandwich with egg whites, avocado, and spinach, and four cheese souffle. My hubby loves their souffle and is delicious. It is made out of buttery puff pastry and has cheese and egg inside of it. Yum! The steel cut oatmeal and the power sandwich are pretty decent. I also got a cinnamon roll to go for free because I had a free birthday pastry to use from being a Panera rewards member. It is huge and can easily be split between two people."
"5.0","Now that I'm working downtown, I'm looking for more restaurants open late. I'm so glad I found Chinatown Inn! Full Disclosure: I've only done take out but have been inside to pick up my meal. But inside looks nice and just like you'd imagine an old school Chinese restaurant looks like. I've ordered the veggie fried rice and lo mein: both delicious. Now I must speak about the egg rolls. I   L O V E  them. Probably the best I've ever had. Great sweet sauce too. Staff always friendly. Open late!"
"5.0","Seriously, just go here. The menu looks small, but everything we had was absolutely incredible. I'm not a huge beer person and had (local) gin and tonic but I'm sure the beer was good because the food was so frickin' great. I'm not going to even try to explain the food because I'll mess it up, but everything we ate was an  amazing mixture of flavors. We had the buffalo chicken starter, the chicharrones, the cauliflower which I would eat every day if I could and we split a chicken sandwich. Really, one of the best meals I've had in quite a while. Just. Go. Here."
"5.0","Great pizza for the price (sauce is a little on the sweet side). Quickly completes orders. Very friendly staff. Very quick service. Nice wide menu. They sell (and deliver) beer! One of the only places I kno that does this! They deserve 5*. Keep up the great work Rialto's!"
"5.0","This restaurant didn't disappoint!  The ambiance was great.  The food was delicious.  We had the French onions soup, chicken Reggiano and the Southwest club, all of which was delicious!  George was our waiter and he was great!  He was. He was. Sry knowledgeable and so friendly!  Can't wait to go back and try other menu items!"
"5.0","First of all.... The Pita land pita bread you get from salems is the best pita bread you could get in western pa... So I quickly ran here before a yelp event (non meal event) to grab some pita a get a quick bite. So after getting the bread I went next door and ended up getting the burger... It was absolutely delicious! Nothing fancy sesame bun with lettuce tomato onion and a well marinated and thick slab of ground beef  cooked to perfection with mayo and ketchup... Man it was tasty."
"2.0","I had a large (10) group of doctors meeting this evening who wanted Indian take out delivered to west penn.  After some calling around I was pleased to find out that prince of India delivered to the hospital.We needed the food delivered as close to 5p as possible as we didn't want to interrupt the meeting by having it come later.  So at 240p (since they are closed 3-430). I called to see if I could place the order to give them plenty of time to make, etc.  They thanked us for doing this. 5pm comes and almost on the dot the delivery driver calls to say he's in the lobby.  Fantastic!  I get the food - (and left a hefty tip!) and take it up to to the docs. 5 of them got chicken tikka masala - all different spice levels.  NOT A SINGLE CONTAINER WAS MARKED.   Really?!?  Note to prince of India staff:  this would be incredibly helpful.  So the person who got a level 1 may have been stuck with a 5.  Not cool prince of India.  Really - not cool.  Not a single container out of everything - vegetarian dishes, meat dishes, etc were marked. So it was a guessing game.The naan (enough for 12) was essentially crumbled into a ball - no one could get a full piece of naan.  Oh - to make matters better we paid for raita - but I am currently sitting in the lobby (530p) waiting for it to be brought because they didn't bring it - or the driver left it in the car.  I was told 10 minutes - when I called them at 505p.  We asked for a credit - because everyone is done eating.  They refused. So we have wasted food and money.  It was finally delivered at 5:40p.We have another meeting like this in January and were planning Indian food.  But I don't imagine it will be with prince of India again.  What a disappointment.  Definitely avoid take out."
"5.0","Ordered the picadillo and carne asada tacos, and they were delicious, flavorful and fresh. Can't wait to return."
"1.0","Food was not fresh, there were piles already cooked meat. And the meat is handled with bare hands, and my debit card/transaction was completed with those same hands.I got the 'Beta Combo', one of the most expensive items on the menu. The portion size was laughable compared to almost any other establishment in Oakland. The 'salad' was the same amount of vegetables as toppings on a taco. The tahini.. was practically fermented. It was sour and effervescent. So wrong.Don't make my mistake. I wish I was exaggerating."
"4.0","We order from here very regularly. Their $6 large cheese pizza deal is great. The sauce is fresh and sweet. Most certainly a great improvement from other pizza places $5 pizza deals on campus.Their other menu items are a little overpriced in my opinion. Once I got mozzarella sticks and cheesy garlic bread, which were both very tasty but a little too much cost-wise for me to order those from there again."
"4.0","Wow!  the reviews are correct on this place.  In town for conference and found this on Yelp.  So glad we did!  Chef's Selection plate to start was fantastic... local cheese mixed with meat butchered and cured on site.  Amazing.  Cocktails were very good though a bit pricey.   All three entres ordered were top notch.  We had the fish of the day (salmon), the pork chop and the Genevese pasta dish.   All were fantastic.  Waitstaff did a great job as well.  Will be back again the next time I'm in town!"
"2.0","I will start by saying the ribs and pork chops were incredible.  Sadly, that was the only good part of my experience.Let me start by saying I have been a bartender, server and chef for a long time and have managed and have been a trainer in each position.  I went in not expecting serve from the left, clear from the right, high - end dining.  However, service was definitely not what should be acceptable in a casino.I asked for a wine / drink menu and was told, 'those are hard to come by' and after our server found one on the adjacent table, was told, 'I can never find one so quickly.'  (The badly used small menu was definitely beat up, not wiped and was falling apart).  I asked the server the name of the 6 offered house wines and then had to explain twice that I was asking about the brand and not the varietals.  She had to go ask.  In the time she was gone, we decided to get a bottle of Woodbridge White Zin.  (Not my first choice, but my folks like white zin).  During this time, the initial drink order arrived after far too long a time.  When we finally received the wine, there was no bottle service presentation at all.  The foil on the top was very improperly cut as the foil was still above the upper lip on the tip and half under the upper lip with the cork re - inserted into the bottle.  So, the dirty blade made contact with the bottle glass that wine was being poured over.  As I ordered the bottle, I should have been given the first taste.  Nope.  She poured my glass, my father's glass and finished with my mother's glass.  Obviously, she should have been the first pour.Oh, let me backtrack and say that the Woodbridge bottle I ordered was not the open bottle we received.  We were given a pre - opened bottle of Beringer that was $11 more expensive.Ordering our meals took a very long time from initial seating.  When we asked the soup of the day, our server had to go back and check.  The three of us ordered wedding soup.  On 2 of the plates, the soup had spilled over making the spoons and cracker packages sticky.  Also, it was the first wedding soup we have ever had with no chicken and no veal / meatballs.  It was pretty much chicken noodle without chicken.Again, the saving part of the visit was the quality of the entrees.  Also, if proper wine presentation is not standard at your location, it should be utilized.  I have had bottles in different level restaurants in different casinos in and out of Pennsylvania.  It seems a universal standard.... especially when you are presented the wrong wine.Filled out the online form and still have not heard anything back.  This explains a lot about the team when management ignores their own request for communication."
"4.0","I came here because a friend recommended me to try the tacos. It was a bit far from where I lived, so I was hesitant to go, but I'm glad that I came. When I first got to the place, I was surprised at how small it was. However, there were a ton of people there. The decorations were really cool, and the art on the menu contributed to a fantastic ambience. I ordered the spicy beef taco and the regular beef taco ($3 for each), and my friend got loaded nachos. The service was fast (compared to how many people were there). My friend was really happy about the loaded nachos - for $5, she got an incredible amount which would have cost maybe $8-9 at another restaurant. My tacos came a bit after and I tried the spicy beef one first. My only disappointment was that the spicy beef meant that it was just a regular beef taco with jalapenos in it, whereas I was expecting actual spices in the beef. However, the tacos were really flavorful, and I loved the toppings. The corn tacos were also able to hold all the meat without falling apart - a pretty impressive feat, if you ask me :) And for a price of $3 per taco, it's relatively inexpensive as well.Overall, I recommend this place and will be back again. To CMU kids - it's kinda far from campus, but it's worth it."
"2.0","My co-worker had been singing it's praises for a while and I had been looking forward to finally checking out the rooftop bar! Should've known not to come on a Saturday night on a clear evening.... my bad.A little known fun fact: you have to take an elevator to the third floor. Oh, and guess what? On a clear, Saturday night, you can bet money there is a long long line to get on said elevator to finally enter the rooftop bar. I had such high hopes and expectations once I finally got on that elevator. But then felt quickly let down at the sight of people crammed like sardines on a roof that barely has standing room. If you are a young, strapping, single person his would be ideal since you are constantly bumping and rubbing up on each other whether you like it or not. But those days are long gone for me... The drinks were ok but we're a bit pricey. It's a premium you pay to be on a third story rooftop. I finally got to experience this place but will most likely not return. Two stars for the 'rooftop' idea for Pittsburgh."
"4.0","I ordered once for takeout and once for delivery from Grub Hub. Food is consistently pretty good. The veggie rolls are huge and fantastic (best part of the meal, by far). I could eat a whole plate of them alone. General Tso's chicken is great. The Cantonese Style Tomato Chili Chicken was not at all what I thought it would be, but it wasn't bad. Delivery takes forever through Grub Hub, and the restaurant forgot one of our veggie rolls, which Grub Hub reimbursed. Those are my only complaints. We will probably order again."
"5.0","Been here a few times and delicious everytime. Made to order pizzas. You pick your crust, I like the multigrain, then sauce & toppings. Super clean, staff is bubbly and the price is right. 5 stars!!"
"4.0","I order here from campusfood.com all the time. You can get two 14'' (or 16''? I don't remember) hoagies for $5.99. All of the hoagies are tasty enough, and for a kid in college, this place is a godsend."
"5.0","We came in for dinner, and ordered two dishes from the menu, both of which were fantastic. The waiter was very attentive, and the food came out very hot. Rice portions were small, as to ensure that it did not get cold, but more was provided upon request. I am a fan of spicy food, but i found a seven (scale 1 to 10) to be extremely spicy. I would not recommend going any hotter."
"4.0","Solid Chinese food! The combination chow fun was very good, I would definitely recommend it over a single choice like chicken. The moo shoo pork and soups were also good. Service was fast and friendly.  Would recommend this place if you are looking for Chinese in the area!"
"5.0","Had a great philly sandwich and super fruit bowl as a starter! Pretty cool&nice place! There crepes are amazing! Definately will visit again!"
"2.0","a restaurant that's in a casino shouldn't have taken 50 min to get our food. Sat on the patio not clean. It was into lunch already. Shrimp po boy was overlooked but was comped. Not a great experience. Always had good service and food here before. Disappointed. What happened rivers?"
"2.0","I was craving indian food on a wednesday night and after checking the ratings I thought this place would be nice. The restaurant occupies a former home which was very open with high ceilings. With all this open space I figured the decorations would match the layout but they didn't. The tables and chairs appeared worn out in their oak finish and had no style in my opinion. The lighting was a little too bright like being in a cafeteria. The door leading to the bathrooms was an industrial style one with a large push bar. You know the kinda door that looks like a fire exit. The kitchen happened to be located behind this same door which made me a little weary.  I was craving tamarind sauce when I came here and since this place is called 'Tamarind' flavor of indian I was expecting some great sauce. We order a samosa appetizer, Biryani rice and chicken tandoori. When our appetizer came out it was accompanied by three different sauces: tamarind, mint and coconut chutneys. The only upside to eating here was that the samosa tasted really good. The breading wasn't too thick and it was nice and crispy but the sauces where horrible. The only one I enjoyed was the white coconut chutney. The mint sauce was watered down with no flavor and the tamarind tasted like sweet spaghetti sauce. The tamarind sauces I've tried have always had a nice rich flavor and are dark and thick like honey or honey-like. This sauce was so thin and tasted nothing like tamarind sauce at all. It almost tasted like it had a ketchup base which disgusted me.I was so disappointed by this sauces that I had the waitress cancel my dinner order. I was going to cancel the whole order but when I approached her she already had the samosa in hand. Although the samosa was good I don't see myself coming back here unless they get some new sauce."
"5.0","My husband and I just moved into the neighborhood and needed a quick bite to eat so I ran to get sandwiches at the 52nd Street Market and I can guarantee you it was the first of MANY trips I will be making to the quaint neighborhood shop! I ordered two sandwiches - The Italian and a turkey one I can't remember the name of - there was only one woman working the counter, and a few orders in front of me so while I waited I walked around to see what they had / there was everything you need and/or could want from a little neighborhood shop- spices, drinks, fresh vegetables. Once I got our sandwiches I realized that even though an 8.75 price tag per sammich had seemed steep, they had loaded it with freshly sliced Boars Head meat! The quality was outstanding and I'm so excited we live close enough to justify frequenting this market!!!"
"3.0","This place had a kitchen issue the day that I went. The service went down hill during our visit. Let me explain....We were here for homecoming for The University of Pittsburgh and we were interested to try the restaurants in the new areas they revitalized. We saw this restaurant and it had decent reviews so we thought why not. We had a larger party and they were able to accommodate us fine. We were a group of 8. I will like to fairly note that we came at different waves. Half of us came first. Then two more and two others. We made our order and it started off fine. They were about 75% full. As we all came we ordered at different times. The timing of the food and the response by the staff is what brought my rating down. The food came at weird times. I recall my friend that came later than the friend that was here first got her food before her. Things like that. There were a slew of mix ups like this and they tried accusing us of their mistakes than just apologizing and moving forward. They said that we accepted the wrong dish that was meant for someone else. What????? You handed the person the entree and blamed us? I feel like a lot of people in the restaurant ordered similar things so they were all confused. They asked me several times if something was meant for our table but it was nothing we ordered. Side note: a tv with football on was in the kitchen. The staffing may have been off today, but the person that looked like the manager did not treat my friend who had the food mix up with great customer service. For the food, I got their $20 brunch combo that included a coffee, entree and crepe. It is a pretty good deal for what you get. I got the vegetable omelette, and the strawberry and Nutella crepe. I thought it was a good meal. Just too bad about the service."
"5.0","I went to caffe Mona for brunch and had an amazing experience. I ordered the Elvis crepe and an iced chai latte, both of which were amazing. I ate on their back porch which is covered with colorful umbrellas and perfect for a sunny summer day. The staff were extremely welcoming and nice and made great recommendations. The owner, Eto, made sure to come by our table more than once to check up on us and brought us complimentary desert. It was a great experience and I will for sure be coming back soon."

My mates had chicken strips.  Everything was good. Not great. I'm not sure if I would go back. Mt. Everest is a block away and soooooo good!!!!"

"5.0","First stop for restaurant week -- and it was an outstanding choice! Capital Grille, you didn't disappoint. We were seated promptly, waited on with such kindness and attention to detail, the food was outstanding (that filet Mignon was killer), and all around enjoyed the atmosphere. The entire staff, from our waiter to the hostess to everyone in between who poured our water and brought out our entrees, was so exceptionally friendly. THIS restaurant is worth the price! We will return next time we're craving an amazing steak or killer martini. (Stoli Doli is awesome!!!)  One of my new favorites in Pittsburgh!"
"5.0","If you're looking for authentic Portuguese food this is the place! Located in the heart of Bloomfield's business district on Liberty Avenue it's an easy commute from anywhere.The decor is very reminiscent of Portugal and the Azores with paintings, photos, paint colors, tableware and more. A roomy space with an airy feel. Table and counter seating in front as well as a back private dining area that's perfect for a group of six or more.The cafe is a breakfast and lunch spot that holds Friday night dinners. We've had breakfast and dinner here. Absolutely amazing dishes full of flavor and love.The coffee and espresso menu boasts even more goodness. Some of the best coffee I've had in the city.Portions are sized just right and dinner is served with baskets of breads and spreads.So good we're often there multiple days in a row."
"1.0","Everyone was incredibly rude that worked here. I asked for cheese wiz on the sub (I'm originally from the Philly area) so That's how I prefer it. They refused to do it but said they can give me a cup of it on the side. Took forever and was not very good. If your looking to get a good cheesesteak this is definitely NOT your place. Then at the end told me their cheesesteaks are better then any place in Philadelphia. Regardless of it being true or not just super ignorant. And it's not try which makes it even funnier!"
"5.0","Highly recommend this restaurant! First impressions: quaint, homey, warm. The smell of lit candles filled the room! Really liked the atmosphere. The wait staff was great and attentive. Our waitress introduced herself then told us that every dish is made from scratch including all their sauces. Every dish was excellent. I don't have anything else to say other than I was rather impressed. I'm extremely excited to come again and try different dishes and seasonal menus. I suggest making a reservation! Starters: *ask for extra bread to pair with the two*-Smoked Gouda: My favorite of the 2. Every element of this appetizer contributed to the experience of eating this piece of cheese. I loved the encrusted wheat finish and the pesto and balsamic together. -Rosie's Meatballs: I could tell they were from scratch - from the 3 large meatballs to the sauce. Very goodEntrees:-Lump Crabcakes: WOW. All components of this dish were delicious from the creamy risotto to the buttery crabcakes to the rich tartar sauce. I think the decision for a broccoli cheese risotto was a value add -Hangar Steak: My friend ordered medium well and it came out exactly as he wished. I took a bite and although I'm not a medium-well girl, I still enjoyed it. I really liked the quality of the steak itself Other random tip: BYOB (cork fee $2 per person)"
