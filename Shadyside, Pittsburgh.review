Loved the atmosphere and decor, it appears to be a nice casual date place. Noodlehead must be a local rage because there was a line from the time we got here, waited (30 minutes) and when we left. They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.\n\nVerdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would. That being said we loved this establishment and the food despite the wait. We didn't have enough time to try the ice cream parlors next door but many people seemed to have checked them out while waiting.\n\nOh yeah if you haven't read the hundreds of reviews notifying you it is cash only, then that ones on you!"}

I had the Chiang Mai noodles and it was one of the best I've had stateside. \n\nThe noodles come out super quickly. The portions are quite large as well. The crispy chicken in the street noodle #1 was quite good, although the sauce was a little sweet and not as balanced as I would've hoped. \n\nThe lemongrass honey iced tea was refreshing and great with the meal as well. They also give you one refill! \n\nI thought that Noodlehead was more of a take-out, hole-in-the-wall but I was pleasantly surprised that the ambiance was so chic + modern. \n\nAll of the noodles are $9.50 which is such a great price!!

If you are wondering: Yes, Noodlehead IS all it is cracked up to be and you should go. Like, right now. \n\nI went on a cold, cloudy fall afternoon, in need of some delicious noodles to warm my soul. The atmosphere of Noodlehead is cozy meets trendy, with dark wood walls, low lighting, and a mix of big and small tables (in which you may find yourself sharing a larger table with another party). Even for a Saturday around early lunchtime, the place was well on their way to being full.\n\nNow, for the menu. For appetizers, we tried the steamed pork dumplings and the pork belly steam buns. Both were fantastic! The steam buns are made with bao buns, so emulate more of a bao pork sandwich than traditional steamed buns that I am accustomed to, but oh so good! We each ordered a noodle dish to accompany the appetizers: the street noodle 2 and the see yew. The see yew was definitely larger in regard to portion size, but I thought both were well-portioned and ultimately my street noodle 2 was turned into two meals. I really appreciate that you can choose your spice level! This made the experience so much more enjoyable, as I could order a spice level 0 and know that I would fully enjoy my food.\n\nNoodlehead, I will return."}

The restaurant was really dark and relatively small, and the person at the counter was a bit indifferent.\n\nWe sat at the tabletop seats (where it was the brightest) and it took a while for our waitress to notice we were ready to order. \nWe ordered a Sukothai noodle (spicy level 4: Thai hot), Street noodle #1 (spicy level: medium), and spring rolls. \nYou can choose your spicy level (not hot ~ crazy hot). \n\nThe food was SOOOOOO DELICIOUS. The portion size was perfect, everything was flavorful, and the ingredients were fresh. The food here definitely tastes more authentic Asian; no shying away from strong herbs and spices. It reminded me of my trips to Southeast Asia. \nAlthough the service wasn't the best, the food ABSOLUTELY made up for it!!!!\nStrongly recommend!!!"}

We weren't really hungry but knew we'll need something for dinner since the last time we ate was around 1pm. We went to Millie's Ice Cream and then decided to stop by Noodlehead to pick some stuff up before taking an Uber back to our hotel. Boy was this place busy on a Friday evening! There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.  I lowered the star rating because of the horrible wait and service - we literally ended up waiting about 1.5 hrs total to be seated and for our food."}

We weren't really hungry but knew we'll need something for dinner since the last time we ate was around 1pm. We went to Millie's Ice Cream and then decided to stop by Noodlehead to pick some stuff up before taking an Uber back to our hotel. Boy was this place busy on a Friday evening! There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.

I had the See Yew which I highly recommend to anyone trying Thai food for the first time. I also tried my friends Green Curry and it was great! I'll have to get my own plate of it next time I go. They have you choose a spice level from 1-5 and I always go with 2 (sometimes it's hotter than others). They stress that you can always add more spice but not take it away, so choose your spice level with caution. The best part of this restaurant?? Every plate is only $9.50! I still can't believe it. \n\nOther things to note: This restaurant is cash only so keep that in mind. They only seat you if your whole party is present. There tends to be a wait on the weekends, but I'll typically go somewhere else nearby to get a drink while waiting. It is also BYOB with a $0.50 up charge per person. \n\nPlease go check out Noodlehead! You won't regret it."}

(The first two times I was unwilling to wait in an 1+ hour line and decided to go elsewhere). \n\nHonestly I knew it would be good, but was a little skeptical since Noodlehead was recommended by everyone I've talked to and on multiple online blogs and platforms. I chalked it up to Pittsburgh just not having enough Thai places to compare against (which is not true). \n\nI came in with my wife on a Friday about 10 minutes after they opened and there were already several groups seated. We opted for the bar seats by the window and were quickly provided menus and water. \n\nThe menu isn't very extensive, but literally each menu item spoke to me and I wanted to order one of everything. \n\nPrices are VERY reasonable with entrees ranging from $6.50 to $9.50 and appetizers for just a few bucks each. \n\nWe ordered the Love Boat and Street Noodles #1. I really liked the Love Boat and felt like the flavors were akin to traditional pho except that the broth was richer. Just wish there was a little more beef in the dish. \n\nThe Street Noodles were in a sweet and sour sauce with a healthy dash of chili pepper flakes which tied in nice spice. The fried chicken was nicely cooked and still moist too\n\nWill definitely be back, probably during a lunch hour, since the line isn't too outrageous then."}

I obviously had high expectations for Noodlehead and was so excited while waiting for a table (for 45 min) but I felt the food and experience were lackluster. \n\nThe restaurant is incredibly crowded and loud, so it is not a very pleasant atmosphere. We were seated at a bar table by the front window, so it was pretty uncomfortable and I felt like a waiter was going to knock me off my seat the entire time. It also felt very rushed - the waiter was working at super speed, our food appeared in a few minutes, and it just felt like we couldn't relax. \n\nI ordered tofu pad see ew, my go to dish at Thai restaurants. The sauce was so sweet and cloying, it was too heavy. Definitely needed more spice or other flavors to balance out the sugar. The portion was a good size, but smaller than typically found. I was surprised to find that the prices were lower than I usually see for Thai food. \n\nPersonally, I see no reason to return to Noodlehead, as there are plenty of local Thai restaurants with comparable or better food, better service, and a much more pleasant atmosphere."}

We ended up getting: the love boat, the pork baos, pad Thai, pad see ew, and the curry noodles. (There were a lot of leftovers). Everything was so delicious it's hard to go wrong with any choice. I would say my personal favorite was the pad see ew, and my boyfriend's favorite was the love boat. The only thing I would have to say is misleading is the spice level-- the dishes weren't as spicy as I was expecting them to be! \n\nThe service was fantastic the whole night and it was just a great atmosphere to dine on a Friday night.

They only take cash and walk-ins for table service as well as takeout. I cannot handle spicy food so I appreciate that they offer 0-5 spice level from which to choose.

If you're looking for authentic flavors, I'd look else where. A lot of the ingredients used in the dishes are adapted and improvised. The Love Boat tasted nothing like a traditional Thai Boat Noodle, but it was edible. \n\nI tried my friend's Chiang Mai Curry which I think is their version of Khao Soi and it was super sweet even when my friend asked for the Level 4 hotness. \n\nOverall, not too impressed. Prices might be good for the area and their portion but don't think I'd really recommend this place to anyone who's looking for good Thai food."}
{"author": "Sahil N.", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2019-11-07", "description": "Had a Spontaneous Saturday Lunch here. Definitely a cool place BUT I wish they took credit cards and had a shorter wait time. My curry noodle was not as spicy as requested (asked for a 4/5), but still enjoyable. I will say, this one lacks the fresh toppings that Smiling Banana Leaf adds. Also, while delicious, it was not as traditional tasting. It has the sweeter, richer, cream filled taste that Americanized Thai has. Still good if you're forced to go there, but if you are asked to choose a place, venture out to Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park.\n\nThe Kee Mao was the highlight! Street Noodle 2 was different and refreshing, better for summer, sweet but tangy, but not much sauce. The Love Boat was decent, oyster sauces based broth which was hearty and on the sweeter side."}

{"author": "Rowena N.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-08-12", "description": "Noodlehead reminds a little of the Midwest,hipster, small restaurant feel mixed with an east coast busyness and clamor. Loved the atmosphere and decor, it appears to be a nice casual date place. Noodlehead must be a local rage because there was a line from the time we got here, waited (30 minutes) and when we left. They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside.

I had the See Yew which I highly recommend to anyone trying Thai food for the first time. I also tried my friends Green Curry and it was great! I'll have to get my own plate of it next time I go. They have you choose a spice level from 1-5 and I always go with 2 (sometimes it's hotter than others). They stress that you can always add more spice but not take it away, so choose your spice level with caution. The best part of this restaurant?? Every plate is only $9.50! I still can't believe it. \n\nOther things to note: This restaurant is cash only so keep that in mind. They only seat you if your whole party is present. There tends to be a wait on the weekends, but I'll typically go somewhere else nearby to get a drink while waiting. It is also BYOB with a $0.50 up charge per person. \n\nPlease go check out Noodlehead! You won't regret it."}

{"author": "Rowena N.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-08-12", "description": "Noodlehead reminds a little of the Midwest,hipster, small restaurant feel mixed with an east coast busyness and clamor. Loved the atmosphere and decor, it appears to be a nice casual date place. Noodlehead must be a local rage because there was a line from the time we got here, waited (30 minutes) and when we left. They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.\n\nVerdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would. That being said we loved this establishment and the food despite the wait. We didn't have enough time to try the ice cream parlors next door but many people seemed to have checked them out while waiting.\n\nOh yeah if you haven't read the hundreds of reviews notifying you it is cash only, then that ones on you!"}

I had the Chiang Mai noodles and it was one of the best I've had stateside. \n\nThe noodles come out super quickly. The portions are quite large as well. The crispy chicken in the street noodle #1 was quite good, although the sauce was a little sweet and not as balanced as I would've hoped. \n\nThe lemongrass honey iced tea was refreshing and great with the meal as well. They also give you one refill! \n\nI thought that Noodlehead was more of a take-out, hole-in-the-wall but I was pleasantly surprised that the ambiance was so chic + modern. \n\nAll of the noodles are $9.50 which is such a great price!!

If you are wondering: Yes, Noodlehead IS all it is cracked up to be and you should go. Like, right now. \n\nI went on a cold, cloudy fall afternoon, in need of some delicious noodles to warm my soul. The atmosphere of Noodlehead is cozy meets trendy, with dark wood walls, low lighting, and a mix of big and small tables (in which you may find yourself sharing a larger table with another party). Even for a Saturday around early lunchtime, the place was well on their way to being full.\n\nNow, for the menu. For appetizers, we tried the steamed pork dumplings and the pork belly steam buns. Both were fantastic! The steam buns are made with bao buns, so emulate more of a bao pork sandwich than traditional steamed buns that I am accustomed to, but oh so good! We each ordered a noodle dish to accompany the appetizers: the street noodle 2 and the see yew. The see yew was definitely larger in regard to portion size, but I thought both were well-portioned and ultimately my street noodle 2 was turned into two meals. I really appreciate that you can choose your spice level! This made the experience so much more enjoyable, as I could order a spice level 0 and know that I would fully enjoy my food.\n\nNoodlehead, I will return."}

The restaurant was really dark and relatively small, and the person at the counter was a bit indifferent.\n\nWe sat at the tabletop seats (where it was the brightest) and it took a while for our waitress to notice we were ready to order. \nWe ordered a Sukothai noodle (spicy level 4: Thai hot), Street noodle #1 (spicy level: medium), and spring rolls. \nYou can choose your spicy level (not hot ~ crazy hot). \n\nThe food was SOOOOOO DELICIOUS. The portion size was perfect, everything was flavorful, and the ingredients were fresh. The food here definitely tastes more authentic Asian; no shying away from strong herbs and spices.

We weren't really hungry but knew we'll need something for dinner since the last time we ate was around 1pm. We went to Millie's Ice Cream and then decided to stop by Noodlehead to pick some stuff up before taking an Uber back to our hotel. Boy was this place busy on a Friday evening! There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.  I lowered the star rating because of the horrible wait and service - we literally ended up waiting about 1.5 hrs total to be seated and for our food."}

We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.\n\nVerdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would. That being said we loved this establishment and the food despite the wait. We didn't have enough time to try the ice cream parlors next door but many people seemed to have checked them out while waiting.\n\nOh yeah if you haven't read the hundreds of reviews notifying you it is cash only, then that ones on you!"}

We weren't really hungry but knew we'll need something for dinner since the last time we ate was around 1pm. We went to Millie's Ice Cream and then decided to stop by Noodlehead to pick some stuff up before taking an Uber back to our hotel. Boy was this place busy on a Friday evening! There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.

I had the See Yew which I highly recommend to anyone trying Thai food for the first time. I also tried my friends Green Curry and it was great! I'll have to get my own plate of it next time I go. They have you choose a spice level from 1-5 and I always go with 2 (sometimes it's hotter than others). They stress that you can always add more spice but not take it away, so choose your spice level with caution. The best part of this restaurant?? Every plate is only $9.50! I still can't believe it. \n\nOther things to note: This restaurant is cash only so keep that in mind. They only seat you if your whole party is present. There tends to be a wait on the weekends, but I'll typically go somewhere else nearby to get a drink while waiting. It is also BYOB with a $0.50 up charge per person. \n\nPlease go check out Noodlehead! You won't regret it."}

(The first two times I was unwilling to wait in an 1+ hour line and decided to go elsewhere). \n\nHonestly I knew it would be good, but was a little skeptical since Noodlehead was recommended by everyone I've talked to and on multiple online blogs and platforms. I chalked it up to Pittsburgh just not having enough Thai places to compare against (which is not true). \n\nI came in with my wife on a Friday about 10 minutes after they opened and there were already several groups seated. We opted for the bar seats by the window and were quickly provided menus and water. \n\nThe menu isn't very extensive, but literally each menu item spoke to me and I wanted to order one of everything. \n\nPrices are VERY reasonable with entrees ranging from $6.50 to $9.50 and appetizers for just a few bucks each. \n\nWe ordered the Love Boat and Street Noodles #1. I really liked the Love Boat and felt like the flavors were akin to traditional pho except that the broth was richer. Just wish there was a little more beef in the dish. \n\nThe Street Noodles were in a sweet and sour sauce with a healthy dash of chili pepper flakes which tied in nice spice. The fried chicken was nicely cooked and still moist too\n\nWill definitely be back, probably during a lunch hour, since the line isn't too outrageous then."}

I obviously had high expectations for Noodlehead and was so excited while waiting for a table (for 45 min) but I felt the food and experience were lackluster. \n\nThe restaurant is incredibly crowded and loud, so it is not a very pleasant atmosphere. We were seated at a bar table by the front window, so it was pretty uncomfortable and I felt like a waiter was going to knock me off my seat the entire time. It also felt very rushed - the waiter was working at super speed, our food appeared in a few minutes, and it just felt like we couldn't relax. \n\nI ordered tofu pad see ew, my go to dish at Thai restaurants. The sauce was so sweet and cloying, it was too heavy. Definitely needed more spice or other flavors to balance out the sugar. The portion was a good size, but smaller than typically found. I was surprised to find that the prices were lower than I usually see for Thai food. \n\nPersonally, I see no reason to return to Noodlehead, as there are plenty of local Thai restaurants with comparable or better food, better service, and a much more pleasant atmosphere."}

We ended up getting: the love boat, the pork baos, pad Thai, pad see ew, and the curry noodles. (There were a lot of leftovers). Everything was so delicious it's hard to go wrong with any choice. I would say my personal favorite was the pad see ew, and my boyfriend's favorite was the love boat. The only thing I would have to say is misleading is the spice level-- the dishes weren't as spicy as I was expecting them to be! \n\nThe service was fantastic the whole night and it was just a great atmosphere to dine on a Friday night.

They only take cash and walk-ins for table service as well as takeout. I cannot handle spicy food so I appreciate that they offer 0-5 spice level from which to choose.

If you're looking for authentic flavors, I'd look else where. A lot of the ingredients used in the dishes are adapted and improvised. The Love Boat tasted nothing like a traditional Thai Boat Noodle, but it was edible. \n\nI tried my friend's Chiang Mai Curry which I think is their version of Khao Soi and it was super sweet even when my friend asked for the Level 4 hotness. \n\nOverall, not too impressed.

Definitely a cool place BUT I wish they took credit cards and had a shorter wait time. My curry noodle was not as spicy as requested (asked for a 4/5), but still enjoyable. I will say, this one lacks the fresh toppings that Smiling Banana Leaf adds. Also, while delicious, it was not as traditional tasting. It has the sweeter, richer, cream filled taste that Americanized Thai has. Still good if you're forced to go there, but if you are asked to choose a place, venture out to Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park.\n\nThe Kee Mao was the highlight! Street Noodle 2 was different and refreshing, better for summer, sweet but tangy, but not much sauce. The Love Boat was decent, oyster sauces based broth which was hearty and on the sweeter side."}

Loved the atmosphere and decor, it appears to be a nice casual date place. Noodlehead must be a local rage because there was a line from the time we got here, waited (30 minutes) and when we left. They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef.

I had the See Yew which I highly recommend to anyone trying Thai food for the first time. I also tried my friends Green Curry and it was great! I'll have to get my own plate of it next time I go. They have you choose a spice level from 1-5 and I always go with 2 (sometimes it's hotter than others). They stress that you can always add more spice but not take it away, so choose your spice level with caution. The best part of this restaurant?? Every plate is only $9.50! I still can't believe it. \n\nOther things to note: This restaurant is cash only so keep that in mind. They only seat you if your whole party is present.

{"author": "Rowena N.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-08-12", "description": "Noodlehead reminds a little of the Midwest,hipster, small restaurant feel mixed with an east coast busyness and clamor. Loved the atmosphere and decor, it appears to be a nice casual date place. Noodlehead must be a local rage because there was a line from the time we got here, waited (30 minutes) and when we left. They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.\n\nVerdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would. That being said we loved this establishment and the food despite the wait. We didn't have enough time to try the ice cream parlors next door but many people seemed to have checked them out while waiting.\n\nOh yeah if you haven't read the hundreds of reviews notifying you it is cash only, then that ones on you!"}

I had the Chiang Mai noodles and it was one of the best I've had stateside. \n\nThe noodles come out super quickly. The portions are quite large as well. The crispy chicken in the street noodle #1 was quite good, although the sauce was a little sweet and not as balanced as I would've hoped. \n\nThe lemongrass honey iced tea was refreshing and great with the meal as well. They also give you one refill! \n\nI thought that Noodlehead was more of a take-out, hole-in-the-wall but I was pleasantly surprised that the ambiance was so chic + modern. \n\nAll of the noodles are $9.50 which is such a great price!!

If you are wondering: Yes, Noodlehead IS all it is cracked up to be and you should go. Like, right now. \n\nI went on a cold, cloudy fall afternoon, in need of some delicious noodles to warm my soul. The atmosphere of Noodlehead is cozy meets trendy, with dark wood walls, low lighting, and a mix of big and small tables (in which you may find yourself sharing a larger table with another party). Even for a Saturday around early lunchtime, the place was well on their way to being full.\n\nNow, for the menu. For appetizers, we tried the steamed pork dumplings and the pork belly steam buns. Both were fantastic! The steam buns are made with bao buns, so emulate more of a bao pork sandwich than traditional steamed buns that I am accustomed to, but oh so good! We each ordered a noodle dish to accompany the appetizers: the street noodle 2 and the see yew. The see yew was definitely larger in regard to portion size, but I thought both were well-portioned and ultimately my street noodle 2 was turned into two meals. I really appreciate that you can choose your spice level! This made the experience so much more enjoyable, as I could order a spice level 0 and know that I would fully enjoy my food.\n\nNoodlehead, I will return."}

The restaurant was really dark and relatively small, and the person at the counter was a bit indifferent.\n\nWe sat at the tabletop seats (where it was the brightest) and it took a while for our waitress to notice we were ready to order. \nWe ordered a Sukothai noodle (spicy level 4: Thai hot), Street noodle #1 (spicy level: medium), and spring rolls. \nYou can choose your spicy level (not hot ~ crazy hot). \n\nThe food was SOOOOOO DELICIOUS. The portion size was perfect, everything was flavorful, and the ingredients were fresh. The food here definitely tastes more authentic Asian; no shying away from strong herbs and spices.

We weren't really hungry but knew we'll need something for dinner since the last time we ate was around 1pm. We went to Millie's Ice Cream and then decided to stop by Noodlehead to pick some stuff up before taking an Uber back to our hotel. Boy was this place busy on a Friday evening! There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.  I lowered the star rating because of the horrible wait and service - we literally ended up waiting about 1.5 hrs total to be seated and for our food."}

The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.\n\nVerdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would. That being said we loved this establishment and the food despite the wait. We didn't have enough time to try the ice cream parlors next door but many people seemed to have checked them out while waiting.\n\nOh yeah if you haven't read the hundreds of reviews notifying you it is cash only, then that ones on you!"}

We weren't really hungry but knew we'll need something for dinner since the last time we ate was around 1pm. We went to Millie's Ice Cream and then decided to stop by Noodlehead to pick some stuff up before taking an Uber back to our hotel. Boy was this place busy on a Friday evening! There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.

I had the See Yew which I highly recommend to anyone trying Thai food for the first time. I also tried my friends Green Curry and it was great! I'll have to get my own plate of it next time I go. They have you choose a spice level from 1-5 and I always go with 2 (sometimes it's hotter than others). They stress that you can always add more spice but not take it away, so choose your spice level with caution. The best part of this restaurant?? Every plate is only $9.50! I still can't believe it. \n\nOther things to note: This restaurant is cash only so keep that in mind. They only seat you if your whole party is present. There tends to be a wait on the weekends, but I'll typically go somewhere else nearby to get a drink while waiting. It is also BYOB with a $0.50 up charge per person. \n\nPlease go check out Noodlehead! You won't regret it."}

(The first two times I was unwilling to wait in an 1+ hour line and decided to go elsewhere). \n\nHonestly I knew it would be good, but was a little skeptical since Noodlehead was recommended by everyone I've talked to and on multiple online blogs and platforms. I chalked it up to Pittsburgh just not having enough Thai places to compare against (which is not true). \n\nI came in with my wife on a Friday about 10 minutes after they opened and there were already several groups seated. We opted for the bar seats by the window and were quickly provided menus and water. \n\nThe menu isn't very extensive, but literally each menu item spoke to me and I wanted to order one of everything. \n\nPrices are VERY reasonable with entrees ranging from $6.50 to $9.50 and appetizers for just a few bucks each. \n\nWe ordered the Love Boat and Street Noodles #1. I really liked the Love Boat and felt like the flavors were akin to traditional pho except that the broth was richer. Just wish there was a little more beef in the dish. \n\nThe Street Noodles were in a sweet and sour sauce with a healthy dash of chili pepper flakes which tied in nice spice. The fried chicken was nicely cooked and still moist too\n\nWill definitely be back, probably during a lunch hour, since the line isn't too outrageous then."}

I obviously had high expectations for Noodlehead and was so excited while waiting for a table (for 45 min) but I felt the food and experience were lackluster. \n\nThe restaurant is incredibly crowded and loud, so it is not a very pleasant atmosphere. We were seated at a bar table by the front window, so it was pretty uncomfortable and I felt like a waiter was going to knock me off my seat the entire time. It also felt very rushed - the waiter was working at super speed, our food appeared in a few minutes, and it just felt like we couldn't relax. \n\nI ordered tofu pad see ew, my go to dish at Thai restaurants. The sauce was so sweet and cloying, it was too heavy. Definitely needed more spice or other flavors to balance out the sugar. The portion was a good size, but smaller than typically found. I was surprised to find that the prices were lower than I usually see for Thai food. \n\nPersonally, I see no reason to return to Noodlehead, as there are plenty of local Thai restaurants with comparable or better food, better service, and a much more pleasant atmosphere."}

We ended up getting: the love boat, the pork baos, pad Thai, pad see ew, and the curry noodles. (There were a lot of leftovers). Everything was so delicious it's hard to go wrong with any choice. I would say my personal favorite was the pad see ew, and my boyfriend's favorite was the love boat. The only thing I would have to say is misleading is the spice level-- the dishes weren't as spicy as I was expecting them to be! \n\nThe service was fantastic the whole night and it was just a great atmosphere to dine on a Friday night.

If you're looking for authentic flavors, I'd look else where. A lot of the ingredients used in the dishes are adapted and improvised. The Love Boat tasted nothing like a traditional Thai Boat Noodle, but it was edible. \n\nI tried my friend's Chiang Mai Curry which I think is their version of Khao Soi and it was super sweet even when my friend asked for the Level 4 hotness. \n\nOverall, not too impressed.

Definitely a cool place BUT I wish they took credit cards and had a shorter wait time. My curry noodle was not as spicy as requested (asked for a 4/5), but still enjoyable. I will say, this one lacks the fresh toppings that Smiling Banana Leaf adds. Also, while delicious, it was not as traditional tasting. It has the sweeter, richer, cream filled taste that Americanized Thai has. Still good if you're forced to go there, but if you are asked to choose a place, venture out to Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park.\n\nThe Kee Mao was the highlight! Street Noodle 2 was different and refreshing, better for summer, sweet but tangy, but not much sauce. The Love Boat was decent, oyster sauces based broth which was hearty and on the sweeter side."}

They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream.

{"author": "Rowena N.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-08-12", "description": "Noodlehead reminds a little of the Midwest,hipster, small restaurant feel mixed with an east coast busyness and clamor. Loved the atmosphere and decor, it appears to be a nice casual date place. Noodlehead must be a local rage because there was a line from the time we got here, waited (30 minutes) and when we left. They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.\n\nVerdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would. That being said we loved this establishment and the food despite the wait. We didn't have enough time to try the ice cream parlors next door but many people seemed to have checked them out while waiting.\n\nOh yeah if you haven't read the hundreds of reviews notifying you it is cash only, then that ones on you!"}

I had the Chiang Mai noodles and it was one of the best I've had stateside. \n\nThe noodles come out super quickly. The portions are quite large as well. The crispy chicken in the street noodle #1 was quite good, although the sauce was a little sweet and not as balanced as I would've hoped. \n\nThe lemongrass honey iced tea was refreshing and great with the meal as well. They also give you one refill! \n\nI thought that Noodlehead was more of a take-out, hole-in-the-wall but I was pleasantly surprised that the ambiance was so chic + modern. \n\nAll of the noodles are $9.50 which is such a great price!! You shouldn't miss Noodlehead, it lives up to expectations."}

If you are wondering: Yes, Noodlehead IS all it is cracked up to be and you should go. Like, right now. \n\nI went on a cold, cloudy fall afternoon, in need of some delicious noodles to warm my soul. The atmosphere of Noodlehead is cozy meets trendy, with dark wood walls, low lighting, and a mix of big and small tables (in which you may find yourself sharing a larger table with another party). Even for a Saturday around early lunchtime, the place was well on their way to being full.\n\nNow, for the menu. For appetizers, we tried the steamed pork dumplings and the pork belly steam buns. Both were fantastic! The steam buns are made with bao buns, so emulate more of a bao pork sandwich than traditional steamed buns that I am accustomed to, but oh so good! We each ordered a noodle dish to accompany the appetizers: the street noodle 2 and the see yew. The see yew was definitely larger in regard to portion size, but I thought both were well-portioned and ultimately my street noodle 2 was turned into two meals. I really appreciate that you can choose your spice level! This made the experience so much more enjoyable, as I could order a spice level 0 and know that I would fully enjoy my food.\n\nNoodlehead, I will return."}

The restaurant was really dark and relatively small, and the person at the counter was a bit indifferent.\n\nWe sat at the tabletop seats (where it was the brightest) and it took a while for our waitress to notice we were ready to order. \nWe ordered a Sukothai noodle (spicy level 4: Thai hot), Street noodle #1 (spicy level: medium), and spring rolls. \nYou can choose your spicy level (not hot ~ crazy hot). \n\nThe food was SOOOOOO DELICIOUS. The portion size was perfect, everything was flavorful, and the ingredients were fresh. The food here definitely tastes more authentic Asian; no shying away from strong herbs and spices.

We weren't really hungry but knew we'll need something for dinner since the last time we ate was around 1pm. We went to Millie's Ice Cream and then decided to stop by Noodlehead to pick some stuff up before taking an Uber back to our hotel. Boy was this place busy on a Friday evening! There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.  I lowered the star rating because of the horrible wait and service - we literally ended up waiting about 1.5 hrs total to be seated and for our food."}

We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.\n\nVerdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would. That being said we loved this establishment and the food despite the wait. We didn't have enough time to try the ice cream parlors next door but many people seemed to have checked them out while waiting.\n\nOh yeah if you haven't read the hundreds of reviews notifying you it is cash only, then that ones on you!"}

We weren't really hungry but knew we'll need something for dinner since the last time we ate was around 1pm. We went to Millie's Ice Cream and then decided to stop by Noodlehead to pick some stuff up before taking an Uber back to our hotel. Boy was this place busy on a Friday evening! There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.  I lowered the star rating because of the horrible wait and service - we literally ended up waiting about 1.5 hrs total to be seated and for our food."}

I had the See Yew which I highly recommend to anyone trying Thai food for the first time. I also tried my friends Green Curry and it was great! I'll have to get my own plate of it next time I go. They have you choose a spice level from 1-5 and I always go with 2 (sometimes it's hotter than others). They stress that you can always add more spice but not take it away, so choose your spice level with caution. The best part of this restaurant?? Every plate is only $9.50! I still can't believe it. \n\nOther things to note: This restaurant is cash only so keep that in mind. They only seat you if your whole party is present. There tends to be a wait on the weekends, but I'll typically go somewhere else nearby to get a drink while waiting. It is also BYOB with a $0.50 up charge per person. \n\nPlease go check out Noodlehead! You won't regret it."}

(The first two times I was unwilling to wait in an 1+ hour line and decided to go elsewhere). \n\nHonestly I knew it would be good, but was a little skeptical since Noodlehead was recommended by everyone I've talked to and on multiple online blogs and platforms. I chalked it up to Pittsburgh just not having enough Thai places to compare against (which is not true). \n\nI came in with my wife on a Friday about 10 minutes after they opened and there were already several groups seated. We opted for the bar seats by the window and were quickly provided menus and water. \n\nThe menu isn't very extensive, but literally each menu item spoke to me and I wanted to order one of everything. \n\nPrices are VERY reasonable with entrees ranging from $6.50 to $9.50 and appetizers for just a few bucks each. \n\nWe ordered the Love Boat and Street Noodles #1. I really liked the Love Boat and felt like the flavors were akin to traditional pho except that the broth was richer. Just wish there was a little more beef in the dish. \n\nThe Street Noodles were in a sweet and sour sauce with a healthy dash of chili pepper flakes which tied in nice spice. The fried chicken was nicely cooked and still moist too\n\nWill definitely be back, probably during a lunch hour, since the line isn't too outrageous then."}

I obviously had high expectations for Noodlehead and was so excited while waiting for a table (for 45 min) but I felt the food and experience were lackluster. \n\nThe restaurant is incredibly crowded and loud, so it is not a very pleasant atmosphere. We were seated at a bar table by the front window, so it was pretty uncomfortable and I felt like a waiter was going to knock me off my seat the entire time. It also felt very rushed - the waiter was working at super speed, our food appeared in a few minutes, and it just felt like we couldn't relax. \n\nI ordered tofu pad see ew, my go to dish at Thai restaurants. The sauce was so sweet and cloying, it was too heavy. Definitely needed more spice or other flavors to balance out the sugar. The portion was a good size, but smaller than typically found. I was surprised to find that the prices were lower than I usually see for Thai food. \n\nPersonally, I see no reason to return to Noodlehead, as there are plenty of local Thai restaurants with comparable or better food, better service, and a much more pleasant atmosphere."}

We ended up getting: the love boat, the pork baos, pad Thai, pad see ew, and the curry noodles. (There were a lot of leftovers). Everything was so delicious it's hard to go wrong with any choice. I would say my personal favorite was the pad see ew, and my boyfriend's favorite was the love boat. The only thing I would have to say is misleading is the spice level-- the dishes weren't as spicy as I was expecting them to be! \n\nThe service was fantastic the whole night and it was just a great atmosphere to dine on a Friday night.

If you're looking for authentic flavors, I'd look else where. A lot of the ingredients used in the dishes are adapted and improvised. The Love Boat tasted nothing like a traditional Thai Boat Noodle, but it was edible. \n\nI tried my friend's Chiang Mai Curry which I think is their version of Khao Soi and it was super sweet even when my friend asked for the Level 4 hotness. \n\nOverall, not too impressed.

Definitely a cool place BUT I wish they took credit cards and had a shorter wait time. My curry noodle was not as spicy as requested (asked for a 4/5), but still enjoyable. I will say, this one lacks the fresh toppings that Smiling Banana Leaf adds. Also, while delicious, it was not as traditional tasting. It has the sweeter, richer, cream filled taste that Americanized Thai has. Still good if you're forced to go there, but if you are asked to choose a place, venture out to Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park.\n\nThe Kee Mao was the highlight! Street Noodle 2 was different and refreshing, better for summer, sweet but tangy, but not much sauce. The Love Boat was decent, oyster sauces based broth which was hearty and on the sweeter side."}

I had the See Yew which I highly recommend to anyone trying Thai food for the first time. I also tried my friends Green Curry and it was great! I'll have to get my own plate of it next time I go. They have you choose a spice level from 1-5 and I always go with 2 (sometimes it's hotter than others). They stress that you can always add more spice but not take it away, so choose your spice level with caution. The best part of this restaurant?? Every plate is only $9.50! I still can't believe it. \n\nOther things to note: This restaurant is cash only so keep that in mind. They only seat you if your whole party is present.

{"author": "Rowena N.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-08-12", "description": "Noodlehead reminds a little of the Midwest,hipster, small restaurant feel mixed with an east coast busyness and clamor. Loved the atmosphere and decor, it appears to be a nice casual date place. Noodlehead must be a local rage because there was a line from the time we got here, waited (30 minutes) and when we left. They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.\n\nVerdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would. That being said we loved this establishment and the food despite the wait. We didn't have enough time to try the ice cream parlors next door but many people seemed to have checked them out while waiting.\n\nOh yeah if you haven't read the hundreds of reviews notifying you it is cash only, then that ones on you!"}

I had the Chiang Mai noodles and it was one of the best I've had stateside. \n\nThe noodles come out super quickly. The portions are quite large as well. The crispy chicken in the street noodle #1 was quite good, although the sauce was a little sweet and not as balanced as I would've hoped. \n\nThe lemongrass honey iced tea was refreshing and great with the meal as well. They also give you one refill! \n\nI thought that Noodlehead was more of a take-out, hole-in-the-wall but I was pleasantly surprised that the ambiance was so chic + modern. \n\nAll of the noodles are $9.50 which is such a great price!! You shouldn't miss Noodlehead, it lives up to expectations."}

If you are wondering: Yes, Noodlehead IS all it is cracked up to be and you should go. Like, right now. \n\nI went on a cold, cloudy fall afternoon, in need of some delicious noodles to warm my soul. The atmosphere of Noodlehead is cozy meets trendy, with dark wood walls, low lighting, and a mix of big and small tables (in which you may find yourself sharing a larger table with another party). Even for a Saturday around early lunchtime, the place was well on their way to being full.\n\nNow, for the menu. For appetizers, we tried the steamed pork dumplings and the pork belly steam buns. Both were fantastic! The steam buns are made with bao buns, so emulate more of a bao pork sandwich than traditional steamed buns that I am accustomed to, but oh so good! We each ordered a noodle dish to accompany the appetizers: the street noodle 2 and the see yew. The see yew was definitely larger in regard to portion size, but I thought both were well-portioned and ultimately my street noodle 2 was turned into two meals. I really appreciate that you can choose your spice level! This made the experience so much more enjoyable, as I could order a spice level 0 and know that I would fully enjoy my food.\n\nNoodlehead, I will return."}

The portion size was perfect, everything was flavorful, and the ingredients were fresh. The food here definitely tastes more authentic Asian; no shying away from strong herbs and spices.

We weren't really hungry but knew we'll need something for dinner since the last time we ate was around 1pm. We went to Millie's Ice Cream and then decided to stop by Noodlehead to pick some stuff up before taking an Uber back to our hotel. Boy was this place busy on a Friday evening! There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?!

Loved the atmosphere and decor, it appears to be a nice casual date place. Noodlehead must be a local rage because there was a line from the time we got here, waited (30 minutes) and when we left. They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.\n\nVerdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would.

We weren't really hungry but knew we'll need something for dinner since the last time we ate was around 1pm. We went to Millie's Ice Cream and then decided to stop by Noodlehead to pick some stuff up before taking an Uber back to our hotel. Boy was this place busy on a Friday evening! There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.  I lowered the star rating because of the horrible wait and service - we literally ended up waiting about 1.5 hrs total to be seated and for our food."}

I had the See Yew which I highly recommend to anyone trying Thai food for the first time. I also tried my friends Green Curry and it was great! I'll have to get my own plate of it next time I go. They have you choose a spice level from 1-5 and I always go with 2 (sometimes it's hotter than others). They stress that you can always add more spice but not take it away, so choose your spice level with caution. The best part of this restaurant?? Every plate is only $9.50! I still can't believe it. \n\nOther things to note: This restaurant is cash only so keep that in mind. They only seat you if your whole party is present. There tends to be a wait on the weekends, but I'll typically go somewhere else nearby to get a drink while waiting. It is also BYOB with a $0.50 up charge per person. \n\nPlease go check out Noodlehead! You won't regret it."}

(The first two times I was unwilling to wait in an 1+ hour line and decided to go elsewhere). \n\nHonestly I knew it would be good, but was a little skeptical since Noodlehead was recommended by everyone I've talked to and on multiple online blogs and platforms. I chalked it up to Pittsburgh just not having enough Thai places to compare against (which is not true). \n\nI came in with my wife on a Friday about 10 minutes after they opened and there were already several groups seated. We opted for the bar seats by the window and were quickly provided menus and water. \n\nThe menu isn't very extensive, but literally each menu item spoke to me and I wanted to order one of everything. \n\nPrices are VERY reasonable with entrees ranging from $6.50 to $9.50 and appetizers for just a few bucks each. \n\nWe ordered the Love Boat and Street Noodles #1. I really liked the Love Boat and felt like the flavors were akin to traditional pho except that the broth was richer. Just wish there was a little more beef in the dish. \n\nThe Street Noodles were in a sweet and sour sauce with a healthy dash of chili pepper flakes which tied in nice spice. The fried chicken was nicely cooked and still moist too\n\nWill definitely be back, probably during a lunch hour, since the line isn't too outrageous then."}

I obviously had high expectations for Noodlehead and was so excited while waiting for a table (for 45 min) but I felt the food and experience were lackluster. \n\nThe restaurant is incredibly crowded and loud, so it is not a very pleasant atmosphere. We were seated at a bar table by the front window, so it was pretty uncomfortable and I felt like a waiter was going to knock me off my seat the entire time. It also felt very rushed - the waiter was working at super speed, our food appeared in a few minutes, and it just felt like we couldn't relax. \n\nI ordered tofu pad see ew, my go to dish at Thai restaurants. The sauce was so sweet and cloying, it was too heavy. Definitely needed more spice or other flavors to balance out the sugar. The portion was a good size, but smaller than typically found. I was surprised to find that the prices were lower than I usually see for Thai food. \n\nPersonally, I see no reason to return to Noodlehead, as there are plenty of local Thai restaurants with comparable or better food, better service, and a much more pleasant atmosphere."}

I would say my personal favorite was the pad see ew, and my boyfriend's favorite was the love boat.

If you're looking for authentic flavors, I'd look else where. A lot of the ingredients used in the dishes are adapted and improvised. The Love Boat tasted nothing like a traditional Thai Boat Noodle, but it was edible. \n\nI tried my friend's Chiang Mai Curry which I think is their version of Khao Soi and it was super sweet even when my friend asked for the Level 4 hotness. \n\nOverall, not too impressed.

Definitely a cool place BUT I wish they took credit cards and had a shorter wait time. My curry noodle was not as spicy as requested (asked for a 4/5), but still enjoyable. I will say, this one lacks the fresh toppings that Smiling Banana Leaf adds. Also, while delicious, it was not as traditional tasting. It has the sweeter, richer, cream filled taste that Americanized Thai has. Still good if you're forced to go there, but if you are asked to choose a place, venture out to Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park.\n\nThe Kee Mao was the highlight! Street Noodle 2 was different and refreshing, better for summer, sweet but tangy, but not much sauce. The Love Boat was decent, oyster sauces based broth which was hearty and on the sweeter side."}

Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.  I lowered the star rating because of the horrible wait and service - we literally ended up waiting about 1.5 hrs total to be seated and for our food."}

I had the See Yew which I highly recommend to anyone trying Thai food for the first time. I also tried my friends Green Curry and it was great! I'll have to get my own plate of it next time I go. They have you choose a spice level from 1-5 and I always go with 2 (sometimes it's hotter than others). They stress that you can always add more spice but not take it away, so choose your spice level with caution. The best part of this restaurant?? Every plate is only $9.50! I still can't believe it. \n\nOther things to note: This restaurant is cash only so keep that in mind. They only seat you if your whole party is present.

{"author": "Rowena N.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-08-12", "description": "Noodlehead reminds a little of the Midwest,hipster, small restaurant feel mixed with an east coast busyness and clamor. Loved the atmosphere and decor, it appears to be a nice casual date place. Noodlehead must be a local rage because there was a line from the time we got here, waited (30 minutes) and when we left. They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.\n\nVerdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would. That being said we loved this establishment and the food despite the wait. We didn't have enough time to try the ice cream parlors next door but many people seemed to have checked them out while waiting.\n\nOh yeah if you haven't read the hundreds of reviews notifying you it is cash only, then that ones on you!"}

I had the Chiang Mai noodles and it was one of the best I've had stateside. \n\nThe noodles come out super quickly. The portions are quite large as well. The crispy chicken in the street noodle #1 was quite good, although the sauce was a little sweet and not as balanced as I would've hoped. \n\nThe lemongrass honey iced tea was refreshing and great with the meal as well. They also give you one refill! \n\nI thought that Noodlehead was more of a take-out, hole-in-the-wall but I was pleasantly surprised that the ambiance was so chic + modern. \n\nAll of the noodles are $9.50 which is such a great price!! You shouldn't miss Noodlehead, it lives up to expectations."}

If you are wondering: Yes, Noodlehead IS all it is cracked up to be and you should go. Like, right now. \n\nI went on a cold, cloudy fall afternoon, in need of some delicious noodles to warm my soul. The atmosphere of Noodlehead is cozy meets trendy, with dark wood walls, low lighting, and a mix of big and small tables (in which you may find yourself sharing a larger table with another party). Even for a Saturday around early lunchtime, the place was well on their way to being full.\n\nNow, for the menu. For appetizers, we tried the steamed pork dumplings and the pork belly steam buns. Both were fantastic! The steam buns are made with bao buns, so emulate more of a bao pork sandwich than traditional steamed buns that I am accustomed to, but oh so good! We each ordered a noodle dish to accompany the appetizers: the street noodle 2 and the see yew. The see yew was definitely larger in regard to portion size, but I thought both were well-portioned and ultimately my street noodle 2 was turned into two meals. I really appreciate that you can choose your spice level! This made the experience so much more enjoyable, as I could order a spice level 0 and know that I would fully enjoy my food.\n\nNoodlehead, I will return."}

The portion size was perfect, everything was flavorful, and the ingredients were fresh. The food here definitely tastes more authentic Asian; no shying away from strong herbs and spices.

We weren't really hungry but knew we'll need something for dinner since the last time we ate was around 1pm. We went to Millie's Ice Cream and then decided to stop by Noodlehead to pick some stuff up before taking an Uber back to our hotel. Boy was this place busy on a Friday evening! There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern!

They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good.

We weren't really hungry but knew we'll need something for dinner since the last time we ate was around 1pm. We went to Millie's Ice Cream and then decided to stop by Noodlehead to pick some stuff up before taking an Uber back to our hotel. Boy was this place busy on a Friday evening! There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.  I lowered the star rating because of the horrible wait and service - we literally ended up waiting about 1.5 hrs total to be seated and for our food."}

I had the See Yew which I highly recommend to anyone trying Thai food for the first time. I also tried my friends Green Curry and it was great! I'll have to get my own plate of it next time I go. They have you choose a spice level from 1-5 and I always go with 2 (sometimes it's hotter than others). They stress that you can always add more spice but not take it away, so choose your spice level with caution. The best part of this restaurant?? Every plate is only $9.50! I still can't believe it. \n\nOther things to note: This restaurant is cash only so keep that in mind. They only seat you if your whole party is present. There tends to be a wait on the weekends, but I'll typically go somewhere else nearby to get a drink while waiting. It is also BYOB with a $0.50 up charge per person. \n\nPlease go check out Noodlehead! You won't regret it."}

(The first two times I was unwilling to wait in an 1+ hour line and decided to go elsewhere). \n\nHonestly I knew it would be good, but was a little skeptical since Noodlehead was recommended by everyone I've talked to and on multiple online blogs and platforms. I chalked it up to Pittsburgh just not having enough Thai places to compare against (which is not true). \n\nI came in with my wife on a Friday about 10 minutes after they opened and there were already several groups seated. We opted for the bar seats by the window and were quickly provided menus and water. \n\nThe menu isn't very extensive, but literally each menu item spoke to me and I wanted to order one of everything. \n\nPrices are VERY reasonable with entrees ranging from $6.50 to $9.50 and appetizers for just a few bucks each. \n\nWe ordered the Love Boat and Street Noodles #1. I really liked the Love Boat and felt like the flavors were akin to traditional pho except that the broth was richer. Just wish there was a little more beef in the dish. \n\nThe Street Noodles were in a sweet and sour sauce with a healthy dash of chili pepper flakes which tied in nice spice. The fried chicken was nicely cooked and still moist too\n\nWill definitely be back, probably during a lunch hour, since the line isn't too outrageous then."}

I obviously had high expectations for Noodlehead and was so excited while waiting for a table (for 45 min) but I felt the food and experience were lackluster. \n\nThe restaurant is incredibly crowded and loud, so it is not a very pleasant atmosphere. We were seated at a bar table by the front window, so it was pretty uncomfortable and I felt like a waiter was going to knock me off my seat the entire time. It also felt very rushed - the waiter was working at super speed, our food appeared in a few minutes, and it just felt like we couldn't relax. \n\nI ordered tofu pad see ew, my go to dish at Thai restaurants. The sauce was so sweet and cloying, it was too heavy. Definitely needed more spice or other flavors to balance out the sugar. The portion was a good size, but smaller than typically found. I was surprised to find that the prices were lower than I usually see for Thai food. \n\nPersonally, I see no reason to return to Noodlehead, as there are plenty of local Thai restaurants with comparable or better food, better service, and a much more pleasant atmosphere."}

I would say my personal favorite was the pad see ew, and my boyfriend's favorite was the love boat.

If you're looking for authentic flavors, I'd look else where. A lot of the ingredients used in the dishes are adapted and improvised. The Love Boat tasted nothing like a traditional Thai Boat Noodle, but it was edible. \n\nI tried my friend's Chiang Mai Curry which I think is their version of Khao Soi and it was super sweet even when my friend asked for the Level 4 hotness. \n\nOverall, not too impressed.

Definitely a cool place BUT I wish they took credit cards and had a shorter wait time. My curry noodle was not as spicy as requested (asked for a 4/5), but still enjoyable. I will say, this one lacks the fresh toppings that Smiling Banana Leaf adds. Also, while delicious, it was not as traditional tasting. It has the sweeter, richer, cream filled taste that Americanized Thai has. Still good if you're forced to go there, but if you are asked to choose a place, venture out to Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park.\n\nThe Kee Mao was the highlight! Street Noodle 2 was different and refreshing, better for summer, sweet but tangy, but not much sauce. The Love Boat was decent, oyster sauces based broth which was hearty and on the sweeter side."}

We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.  I lowered the star rating because of the horrible wait and service - we literally ended up waiting about 1.5 hrs total to be seated and for our food."}

I had the See Yew which I highly recommend to anyone trying Thai food for the first time. I also tried my friends Green Curry and it was great! I'll have to get my own plate of it next time I go. They have you choose a spice level from 1-5 and I always go with 2 (sometimes it's hotter than others). They stress that you can always add more spice but not take it away, so choose your spice level with caution. The best part of this restaurant?? Every plate is only $9.50! I still can't believe it. \n\nOther things to note: This restaurant is cash only so keep that in mind. They only seat you if your whole party is present.

{"author": "Rowena N.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-08-12", "description": "Noodlehead reminds a little of the Midwest,hipster, small restaurant feel mixed with an east coast busyness and clamor. Loved the atmosphere and decor, it appears to be a nice casual date place. Noodlehead must be a local rage because there was a line from the time we got here, waited (30 minutes) and when we left. They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.\n\nVerdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would. That being said we loved this establishment and the food despite the wait. We didn't have enough time to try the ice cream parlors next door but many people seemed to have checked them out while waiting.\n\nOh yeah if you haven't read the hundreds of reviews notifying you it is cash only, then that ones on you!"}

I had the Chiang Mai noodles and it was one of the best I've had stateside. \n\nThe noodles come out super quickly. The portions are quite large as well. The crispy chicken in the street noodle #1 was quite good, although the sauce was a little sweet and not as balanced as I would've hoped. \n\nThe lemongrass honey iced tea was refreshing and great with the meal as well. They also give you one refill! \n\nI thought that Noodlehead was more of a take-out, hole-in-the-wall but I was pleasantly surprised that the ambiance was so chic + modern. \n\nAll of the noodles are $9.50 which is such a great price!! You shouldn't miss Noodlehead, it lives up to expectations."}

If you are wondering: Yes, Noodlehead IS all it is cracked up to be and you should go. Like, right now. \n\nI went on a cold, cloudy fall afternoon, in need of some delicious noodles to warm my soul. The atmosphere of Noodlehead is cozy meets trendy, with dark wood walls, low lighting, and a mix of big and small tables (in which you may find yourself sharing a larger table with another party). Even for a Saturday around early lunchtime, the place was well on their way to being full.\n\nNow, for the menu. For appetizers, we tried the steamed pork dumplings and the pork belly steam buns. Both were fantastic! The steam buns are made with bao buns, so emulate more of a bao pork sandwich than traditional steamed buns that I am accustomed to, but oh so good! We each ordered a noodle dish to accompany the appetizers: the street noodle 2 and the see yew. The see yew was definitely larger in regard to portion size, but I thought both were well-portioned and ultimately my street noodle 2 was turned into two meals. I really appreciate that you can choose your spice level! This made the experience so much more enjoyable, as I could order a spice level 0 and know that I would fully enjoy my food.\n\nNoodlehead, I will return."}

The portion size was perfect, everything was flavorful, and the ingredients were fresh. The food here definitely tastes more authentic Asian; no shying away from strong herbs and spices.

Loved the atmosphere and decor, it appears to be a nice casual date place. Noodlehead must be a local rage because there was a line from the time we got here, waited (30 minutes) and when we left. They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.\n\nVerdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would.

We weren't really hungry but knew we'll need something for dinner since the last time we ate was around 1pm. We went to Millie's Ice Cream and then decided to stop by Noodlehead to pick some stuff up before taking an Uber back to our hotel. Boy was this place busy on a Friday evening! There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.  I lowered the star rating because of the horrible wait and service - we literally ended up waiting about 1.5 hrs total to be seated and for our food."}

I had the See Yew which I highly recommend to anyone trying Thai food for the first time. I also tried my friends Green Curry and it was great! I'll have to get my own plate of it next time I go. They have you choose a spice level from 1-5 and I always go with 2 (sometimes it's hotter than others). They stress that you can always add more spice but not take it away, so choose your spice level with caution. The best part of this restaurant?? Every plate is only $9.50! I still can't believe it. \n\nOther things to note: This restaurant is cash only so keep that in mind. They only seat you if your whole party is present. There tends to be a wait on the weekends, but I'll typically go somewhere else nearby to get a drink while waiting. It is also BYOB with a $0.50 up charge per person. \n\nPlease go check out Noodlehead! You won't regret it."}

(The first two times I was unwilling to wait in an 1+ hour line and decided to go elsewhere). \n\nHonestly I knew it would be good, but was a little skeptical since Noodlehead was recommended by everyone I've talked to and on multiple online blogs and platforms. I chalked it up to Pittsburgh just not having enough Thai places to compare against (which is not true). \n\nI came in with my wife on a Friday about 10 minutes after they opened and there were already several groups seated. We opted for the bar seats by the window and were quickly provided menus and water. \n\nThe menu isn't very extensive, but literally each menu item spoke to me and I wanted to order one of everything. \n\nPrices are VERY reasonable with entrees ranging from $6.50 to $9.50 and appetizers for just a few bucks each. \n\nWe ordered the Love Boat and Street Noodles #1. I really liked the Love Boat and felt like the flavors were akin to traditional pho except that the broth was richer. Just wish there was a little more beef in the dish. \n\nThe Street Noodles were in a sweet and sour sauce with a healthy dash of chili pepper flakes which tied in nice spice. The fried chicken was nicely cooked and still moist too\n\nWill definitely be back, probably during a lunch hour, since the line isn't too outrageous then."}

I obviously had high expectations for Noodlehead and was so excited while waiting for a table (for 45 min) but I felt the food and experience were lackluster. \n\nThe restaurant is incredibly crowded and loud, so it is not a very pleasant atmosphere. We were seated at a bar table by the front window, so it was pretty uncomfortable and I felt like a waiter was going to knock me off my seat the entire time. It also felt very rushed - the waiter was working at super speed, our food appeared in a few minutes, and it just felt like we couldn't relax. \n\nI ordered tofu pad see ew, my go to dish at Thai restaurants. The sauce was so sweet and cloying, it was too heavy. Definitely needed more spice or other flavors to balance out the sugar. The portion was a good size, but smaller than typically found. I was surprised to find that the prices were lower than I usually see for Thai food. \n\nPersonally, I see no reason to return to Noodlehead, as there are plenty of local Thai restaurants with comparable or better food, better service, and a much more pleasant atmosphere."}

I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.  I lowered the star rating because of the horrible wait and service - we literally ended up waiting about 1.5 hrs total to be seated and for our food."}

I had the See Yew which I highly recommend to anyone trying Thai food for the first time. I also tried my friends Green Curry and it was great! I'll have to get my own plate of it next time I go. They have you choose a spice level from 1-5 and I always go with 2 (sometimes it's hotter than others). They stress that you can always add more spice but not take it away, so choose your spice level with caution. The best part of this restaurant?? Every plate is only $9.50! I still can't believe it. \n\nOther things to note: This restaurant is cash only so keep that in mind. They only seat you if your whole party is present.

It has the sweeter, richer, cream filled taste that Americanized Thai has. Still good if you're forced to go there, but if you are asked to choose a place, venture out to Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park.\n\nThe Kee Mao was the highlight!

{"author": "Rowena N.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-08-12", "description": "Noodlehead reminds a little of the Midwest,hipster, small restaurant feel mixed with an east coast busyness and clamor. Loved the atmosphere and decor, it appears to be a nice casual date place. Noodlehead must be a local rage because there was a line from the time we got here, waited (30 minutes) and when we left. They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.\n\nVerdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would. That being said we loved this establishment and the food despite the wait. We didn't have enough time to try the ice cream parlors next door but many people seemed to have checked them out while waiting.\n\nOh yeah if you haven't read the hundreds of reviews notifying you it is cash only, then that ones on you!"}

I had the Chiang Mai noodles and it was one of the best I've had stateside. \n\nThe noodles come out super quickly. The portions are quite large as well. The crispy chicken in the street noodle #1 was quite good, although the sauce was a little sweet and not as balanced as I would've hoped. \n\nThe lemongrass honey iced tea was refreshing and great with the meal as well. They also give you one refill! \n\nI thought that Noodlehead was more of a take-out, hole-in-the-wall but I was pleasantly surprised that the ambiance was so chic + modern. \n\nAll of the noodles are $9.50 which is such a great price!! You shouldn't miss Noodlehead, it lives up to expectations."}

If you are wondering: Yes, Noodlehead IS all it is cracked up to be and you should go. Like, right now. \n\nI went on a cold, cloudy fall afternoon, in need of some delicious noodles to warm my soul. The atmosphere of Noodlehead is cozy meets trendy, with dark wood walls, low lighting, and a mix of big and small tables (in which you may find yourself sharing a larger table with another party). Even for a Saturday around early lunchtime, the place was well on their way to being full.\n\nNow, for the menu. For appetizers, we tried the steamed pork dumplings and the pork belly steam buns. Both were fantastic! The steam buns are made with bao buns, so emulate more of a bao pork sandwich than traditional steamed buns that I am accustomed to, but oh so good! We each ordered a noodle dish to accompany the appetizers: the street noodle 2 and the see yew. The see yew was definitely larger in regard to portion size, but I thought both were well-portioned and ultimately my street noodle 2 was turned into two meals. I really appreciate that you can choose your spice level! This made the experience so much more enjoyable, as I could order a spice level 0 and know that I would fully enjoy my food.\n\nNoodlehead, I will return."}

It has the sweeter, richer, cream filled taste that Americanized Thai has. Still good if you're forced to go there, but if you are asked to choose a place, venture out to Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park.\n\nThe Kee Mao was the highlight! Street Noodle 2 was different and refreshing, better for summer, sweet but tangy, but not much sauce. The Love Boat was decent, oyster sauces based broth which was hearty and on the sweeter side."}

Loved the atmosphere and decor, it appears to be a nice casual date place. Noodlehead must be a local rage because there was a line from the time we got here, waited (30 minutes) and when we left. They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.\n\nVerdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would.

We weren't really hungry but knew we'll need something for dinner since the last time we ate was around 1pm. We went to Millie's Ice Cream and then decided to stop by Noodlehead to pick some stuff up before taking an Uber back to our hotel. Boy was this place busy on a Friday evening! There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.  I lowered the star rating because of the horrible wait and service - we literally ended up waiting about 1.5 hrs total to be seated and for our food."}

I had the See Yew which I highly recommend to anyone trying Thai food for the first time. I also tried my friends Green Curry and it was great! I'll have to get my own plate of it next time I go. They have you choose a spice level from 1-5 and I always go with 2 (sometimes it's hotter than others). They stress that you can always add more spice but not take it away, so choose your spice level with caution. The best part of this restaurant?? Every plate is only $9.50! I still can't believe it. \n\nOther things to note: This restaurant is cash only so keep that in mind. They only seat you if your whole party is present. There tends to be a wait on the weekends, but I'll typically go somewhere else nearby to get a drink while waiting. It is also BYOB with a $0.50 up charge per person. \n\nPlease go check out Noodlehead! You won't regret it."}

(The first two times I was unwilling to wait in an 1+ hour line and decided to go elsewhere). \n\nHonestly I knew it would be good, but was a little skeptical since Noodlehead was recommended by everyone I've talked to and on multiple online blogs and platforms. I chalked it up to Pittsburgh just not having enough Thai places to compare against (which is not true). \n\nI came in with my wife on a Friday about 10 minutes after they opened and there were already several groups seated. We opted for the bar seats by the window and were quickly provided menus and water. \n\nThe menu isn't very extensive, but literally each menu item spoke to me and I wanted to order one of everything. \n\nPrices are VERY reasonable with entrees ranging from $6.50 to $9.50 and appetizers for just a few bucks each. \n\nWe ordered the Love Boat and Street Noodles #1. I really liked the Love Boat and felt like the flavors were akin to traditional pho except that the broth was richer. Just wish there was a little more beef in the dish. \n\nThe Street Noodles were in a sweet and sour sauce with a healthy dash of chili pepper flakes which tied in nice spice. The fried chicken was nicely cooked and still moist too\n\nWill definitely be back, probably during a lunch hour, since the line isn't too outrageous then."}

I obviously had high expectations for Noodlehead and was so excited while waiting for a table (for 45 min) but I felt the food and experience were lackluster. \n\nThe restaurant is incredibly crowded and loud, so it is not a very pleasant atmosphere. We were seated at a bar table by the front window, so it was pretty uncomfortable and I felt like a waiter was going to knock me off my seat the entire time. It also felt very rushed - the waiter was working at super speed, our food appeared in a few minutes, and it just felt like we couldn't relax. \n\nI ordered tofu pad see ew, my go to dish at Thai restaurants. The sauce was so sweet and cloying, it was too heavy. Definitely needed more spice or other flavors to balance out the sugar. The portion was a good size, but smaller than typically found. I was surprised to find that the prices were lower than I usually see for Thai food. \n\nPersonally, I see no reason to return to Noodlehead, as there are plenty of local Thai restaurants with comparable or better food, better service, and a much more pleasant atmosphere."}

It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.  I lowered the star rating because of the horrible wait and service - we literally ended up waiting about 1.5 hrs total to be seated and for our food."}

I had the See Yew which I highly recommend to anyone trying Thai food for the first time. I also tried my friends Green Curry and it was great! I'll have to get my own plate of it next time I go. They have you choose a spice level from 1-5 and I always go with 2 (sometimes it's hotter than others).

I still can't believe it. \n\nOther things to note: This restaurant is cash only so keep that in mind. They only seat you if your whole party is present.

Definitely a cool place BUT I wish they took credit cards and had a shorter wait time. My curry noodle was not as spicy as requested (asked for a 4/5), but still enjoyable. I will say, this one lacks the fresh toppings that Smiling Banana Leaf adds. Also, while delicious, it was not as traditional tasting. It has the sweeter, richer, cream filled taste that Americanized Thai has. Still good if you're forced to go there, but if you are asked to choose a place, venture out to Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park.\n\nThe Kee Mao was the highlight! Street Noodle 2 was different and refreshing, better for summer, sweet but tangy, but not much sauce. The Love Boat was decent, oyster sauces based broth which was hearty and on the sweeter side."}

{"author": "Rowena N.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-08-12", "description": "Noodlehead reminds a little of the Midwest,hipster, small restaurant feel mixed with an east coast busyness and clamor. Loved the atmosphere and decor, it appears to be a nice casual date place. Noodlehead must be a local rage because there was a line from the time we got here, waited (30 minutes) and when we left. They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.\n\nVerdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would. That being said we loved this establishment and the food despite the wait. We didn't have enough time to try the ice cream parlors next door but many people seemed to have checked them out while waiting.\n\nOh yeah if you haven't read the hundreds of reviews notifying you it is cash only, then that ones on you!"}

I had the Chiang Mai noodles and it was one of the best I've had stateside. \n\nThe noodles come out super quickly. The portions are quite large as well. The crispy chicken in the street noodle #1 was quite good, although the sauce was a little sweet and not as balanced as I would've hoped. \n\nThe lemongrass honey iced tea was refreshing and great with the meal as well. They also give you one refill! \n\nI thought that Noodlehead was more of a take-out, hole-in-the-wall but I was pleasantly surprised that the ambiance was so chic + modern. \n\nAll of the noodles are $9.50 which is such a great price!! You shouldn't miss Noodlehead, it lives up to expectations."}

If you are wondering: Yes, Noodlehead IS all it is cracked up to be and you should go. Like, right now. \n\nI went on a cold, cloudy fall afternoon, in need of some delicious noodles to warm my soul. The atmosphere of Noodlehead is cozy meets trendy, with dark wood walls, low lighting, and a mix of big and small tables (in which you may find yourself sharing a larger table with another party). Even for a Saturday around early lunchtime, the place was well on their way to being full.\n\nNow, for the menu. For appetizers, we tried the steamed pork dumplings and the pork belly steam buns. Both were fantastic! The steam buns are made with bao buns, so emulate more of a bao pork sandwich than traditional steamed buns that I am accustomed to, but oh so good! We each ordered a noodle dish to accompany the appetizers: the street noodle 2 and the see yew. The see yew was definitely larger in regard to portion size, but I thought both were well-portioned and ultimately my street noodle 2 was turned into two meals. I really appreciate that you can choose your spice level! This made the experience so much more enjoyable, as I could order a spice level 0 and know that I would fully enjoy my food.\n\nNoodlehead, I will return."}

Definitely a cool place BUT I wish they took credit cards and had a shorter wait time. My curry noodle was not as spicy as requested (asked for a 4/5), but still enjoyable. I will say, this one lacks the fresh toppings that Smiling Banana Leaf adds. Also, while delicious, it was not as traditional tasting. It has the sweeter, richer, cream filled taste that Americanized Thai has. Still good if you're forced to go there, but if you are asked to choose a place, venture out to Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park.\n\nThe Kee Mao was the highlight! Street Noodle 2 was different and refreshing, better for summer, sweet but tangy, but not much sauce. The Love Boat was decent, oyster sauces based broth which was hearty and on the sweeter side."}

Loved the atmosphere and decor, it appears to be a nice casual date place. Noodlehead must be a local rage because there was a line from the time we got here, waited (30 minutes) and when we left. They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.\n\nVerdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would.

We weren't really hungry but knew we'll need something for dinner since the last time we ate was around 1pm. We went to Millie's Ice Cream and then decided to stop by Noodlehead to pick some stuff up before taking an Uber back to our hotel. Boy was this place busy on a Friday evening! There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.  I lowered the star rating because of the horrible wait and service - we literally ended up waiting about 1.5 hrs total to be seated and for our food."}

I had the See Yew which I highly recommend to anyone trying Thai food for the first time. I also tried my friends Green Curry and it was great! I'll have to get my own plate of it next time I go. They have you choose a spice level from 1-5 and I always go with 2 (sometimes it's hotter than others). They stress that you can always add more spice but not take it away, so choose your spice level with caution. The best part of this restaurant?? Every plate is only $9.50! I still can't believe it. \n\nOther things to note: This restaurant is cash only so keep that in mind. They only seat you if your whole party is present. There tends to be a wait on the weekends, but I'll typically go somewhere else nearby to get a drink while waiting. It is also BYOB with a $0.50 up charge per person. \n\nPlease go check out Noodlehead! You won't regret it."}

(The first two times I was unwilling to wait in an 1+ hour line and decided to go elsewhere). \n\nHonestly I knew it would be good, but was a little skeptical since Noodlehead was recommended by everyone I've talked to and on multiple online blogs and platforms. I chalked it up to Pittsburgh just not having enough Thai places to compare against (which is not true). \n\nI came in with my wife on a Friday about 10 minutes after they opened and there were already several groups seated. We opted for the bar seats by the window and were quickly provided menus and water. \n\nThe menu isn't very extensive, but literally each menu item spoke to me and I wanted to order one of everything. \n\nPrices are VERY reasonable with entrees ranging from $6.50 to $9.50 and appetizers for just a few bucks each. \n\nWe ordered the Love Boat and Street Noodles #1. I really liked the Love Boat and felt like the flavors were akin to traditional pho except that the broth was richer. Just wish there was a little more beef in the dish. \n\nThe Street Noodles were in a sweet and sour sauce with a healthy dash of chili pepper flakes which tied in nice spice. The fried chicken was nicely cooked and still moist too\n\nWill definitely be back, probably during a lunch hour, since the line isn't too outrageous then."}

I obviously had high expectations for Noodlehead and was so excited while waiting for a table (for 45 min) but I felt the food and experience were lackluster. \n\nThe restaurant is incredibly crowded and loud, so it is not a very pleasant atmosphere. We were seated at a bar table by the front window, so it was pretty uncomfortable and I felt like a waiter was going to knock me off my seat the entire time. It also felt very rushed - the waiter was working at super speed, our food appeared in a few minutes, and it just felt like we couldn't relax. \n\nI ordered tofu pad see ew, my go to dish at Thai restaurants. The sauce was so sweet and cloying, it was too heavy. Definitely needed more spice or other flavors to balance out the sugar. The portion was a good size, but smaller than typically found. I was surprised to find that the prices were lower than I usually see for Thai food. \n\nPersonally, I see no reason to return to Noodlehead, as there are plenty of local Thai restaurants with comparable or better food, better service, and a much more pleasant atmosphere."}

There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.  I lowered the star rating because of the horrible wait and service - we literally ended up waiting about 1.5 hrs total to be seated and for our food."}

I had the See Yew which I highly recommend to anyone trying Thai food for the first time. I also tried my friends Green Curry and it was great! I'll have to get my own plate of it next time I go. They have you choose a spice level from 1-5 and I always go with 2 (sometimes it's hotter than others).

I still can't believe it. \n\nOther things to note: This restaurant is cash only so keep that in mind. They only seat you if your whole party is present.

Definitely a cool place BUT I wish they took credit cards and had a shorter wait time. My curry noodle was not as spicy as requested (asked for a 4/5), but still enjoyable. I will say, this one lacks the fresh toppings that Smiling Banana Leaf adds. Also, while delicious, it was not as traditional tasting. It has the sweeter, richer, cream filled taste that Americanized Thai has. Still good if you're forced to go there, but if you are asked to choose a place, venture out to Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park.\n\nThe Kee Mao was the highlight! Street Noodle 2 was different and refreshing, better for summer, sweet but tangy, but not much sauce. The Love Boat was decent, oyster sauces based broth which was hearty and on the sweeter side."}

{"author": "Rowena N.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-08-12", "description": "Noodlehead reminds a little of the Midwest,hipster, small restaurant feel mixed with an east coast busyness and clamor. Loved the atmosphere and decor, it appears to be a nice casual date place. Noodlehead must be a local rage because there was a line from the time we got here, waited (30 minutes) and when we left. They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.\n\nVerdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would. That being said we loved this establishment and the food despite the wait. We didn't have enough time to try the ice cream parlors next door but many people seemed to have checked them out while waiting.\n\nOh yeah if you haven't read the hundreds of reviews notifying you it is cash only, then that ones on you!"}

I had the Chiang Mai noodles and it was one of the best I've had stateside. \n\nThe noodles come out super quickly. The portions are quite large as well. The crispy chicken in the street noodle #1 was quite good, although the sauce was a little sweet and not as balanced as I would've hoped. \n\nThe lemongrass honey iced tea was refreshing and great with the meal as well. They also give you one refill! \n\nI thought that Noodlehead was more of a take-out, hole-in-the-wall but I was pleasantly surprised that the ambiance was so chic + modern. \n\nAll of the noodles are $9.50 which is such a great price!! You shouldn't miss Noodlehead, it lives up to expectations."}

If you are wondering: Yes, Noodlehead IS all it is cracked up to be and you should go. Like, right now. \n\nI went on a cold, cloudy fall afternoon, in need of some delicious noodles to warm my soul. The atmosphere of Noodlehead is cozy meets trendy, with dark wood walls, low lighting, and a mix of big and small tables (in which you may find yourself sharing a larger table with another party). Even for a Saturday around early lunchtime, the place was well on their way to being full.\n\nNow, for the menu. For appetizers, we tried the steamed pork dumplings and the pork belly steam buns. Both were fantastic! The steam buns are made with bao buns, so emulate more of a bao pork sandwich than traditional steamed buns that I am accustomed to, but oh so good! We each ordered a noodle dish to accompany the appetizers: the street noodle 2 and the see yew. The see yew was definitely larger in regard to portion size, but I thought both were well-portioned and ultimately my street noodle 2 was turned into two meals. I really appreciate that you can choose your spice level! This made the experience so much more enjoyable, as I could order a spice level 0 and know that I would fully enjoy my food.\n\nNoodlehead, I will return."}

Definitely a cool place BUT I wish they took credit cards and had a shorter wait time. My curry noodle was not as spicy as requested (asked for a 4/5), but still enjoyable. I will say, this one lacks the fresh toppings that Smiling Banana Leaf adds. Also, while delicious, it was not as traditional tasting. It has the sweeter, richer, cream filled taste that Americanized Thai has. Still good if you're forced to go there, but if you are asked to choose a place, venture out to Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park.\n\nThe Kee Mao was the highlight! Street Noodle 2 was different and refreshing, better for summer, sweet but tangy, but not much sauce. The Love Boat was decent, oyster sauces based broth which was hearty and on the sweeter side."}

Loved the atmosphere and decor, it appears to be a nice casual date place. Noodlehead must be a local rage because there was a line from the time we got here, waited (30 minutes) and when we left. They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.\n\nVerdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would.

We weren't really hungry but knew we'll need something for dinner since the last time we ate was around 1pm. We went to Millie's Ice Cream and then decided to stop by Noodlehead to pick some stuff up before taking an Uber back to our hotel. Boy was this place busy on a Friday evening! There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.  I lowered the star rating because of the horrible wait and service - we literally ended up waiting about 1.5 hrs total to be seated and for our food."}

I had the See Yew which I highly recommend to anyone trying Thai food for the first time. I also tried my friends Green Curry and it was great! I'll have to get my own plate of it next time I go. They have you choose a spice level from 1-5 and I always go with 2 (sometimes it's hotter than others). They stress that you can always add more spice but not take it away, so choose your spice level with caution. The best part of this restaurant?? Every plate is only $9.50! I still can't believe it. \n\nOther things to note: This restaurant is cash only so keep that in mind. They only seat you if your whole party is present. There tends to be a wait on the weekends, but I'll typically go somewhere else nearby to get a drink while waiting. It is also BYOB with a $0.50 up charge per person. \n\nPlease go check out Noodlehead! You won't regret it."}

(The first two times I was unwilling to wait in an 1+ hour line and decided to go elsewhere). \n\nHonestly I knew it would be good, but was a little skeptical since Noodlehead was recommended by everyone I've talked to and on multiple online blogs and platforms. I chalked it up to Pittsburgh just not having enough Thai places to compare against (which is not true). \n\nI came in with my wife on a Friday about 10 minutes after they opened and there were already several groups seated. We opted for the bar seats by the window and were quickly provided menus and water. \n\nThe menu isn't very extensive, but literally each menu item spoke to me and I wanted to order one of everything. \n\nPrices are VERY reasonable with entrees ranging from $6.50 to $9.50 and appetizers for just a few bucks each. \n\nWe ordered the Love Boat and Street Noodles #1. I really liked the Love Boat and felt like the flavors were akin to traditional pho except that the broth was richer. Just wish there was a little more beef in the dish. \n\nThe Street Noodles were in a sweet and sour sauce with a healthy dash of chili pepper flakes which tied in nice spice. The fried chicken was nicely cooked and still moist too\n\nWill definitely be back, probably during a lunch hour, since the line isn't too outrageous then."}

I obviously had high expectations for Noodlehead and was so excited while waiting for a table (for 45 min) but I felt the food and experience were lackluster. \n\nThe restaurant is incredibly crowded and loud, so it is not a very pleasant atmosphere. We were seated at a bar table by the front window, so it was pretty uncomfortable and I felt like a waiter was going to knock me off my seat the entire time. It also felt very rushed - the waiter was working at super speed, our food appeared in a few minutes, and it just felt like we couldn't relax. \n\nI ordered tofu pad see ew, my go to dish at Thai restaurants. The sauce was so sweet and cloying, it was too heavy. Definitely needed more spice or other flavors to balance out the sugar. The portion was a good size, but smaller than typically found. I was surprised to find that the prices were lower than I usually see for Thai food. \n\nPersonally, I see no reason to return to Noodlehead, as there are plenty of local Thai restaurants with comparable or better food, better service, and a much more pleasant atmosphere."}

We weren't really hungry but knew we'll need something for dinner since the last time we ate was around 1pm. We went to Millie's Ice Cream and then decided to stop by Noodlehead to pick some stuff up before taking an Uber back to our hotel. Boy was this place busy on a Friday evening! There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.  I lowered the star rating because of the horrible wait and service - we literally ended up waiting about 1.5 hrs total to be seated and for our food."}

I had the See Yew which I highly recommend to anyone trying Thai food for the first time. I also tried my friends Green Curry and it was great! I'll have to get my own plate of it next time I go.

Definitely a cool place BUT I wish they took credit cards and had a shorter wait time. My curry noodle was not as spicy as requested (asked for a 4/5), but still enjoyable. I will say, this one lacks the fresh toppings that Smiling Banana Leaf adds. Also, while delicious, it was not as traditional tasting. It has the sweeter, richer, cream filled taste that Americanized Thai has. Still good if you're forced to go there, but if you are asked to choose a place, venture out to Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park.\n\nThe Kee Mao was the highlight! Street Noodle 2 was different and refreshing, better for summer, sweet but tangy, but not much sauce. The Love Boat was decent, oyster sauces based broth which was hearty and on the sweeter side."}

{"author": "Rowena N.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-08-12", "description": "Noodlehead reminds a little of the Midwest,hipster, small restaurant feel mixed with an east coast busyness and clamor. Loved the atmosphere and decor, it appears to be a nice casual date place. Noodlehead must be a local rage because there was a line from the time we got here, waited (30 minutes) and when we left. They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.\n\nVerdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would. That being said we loved this establishment and the food despite the wait. We didn't have enough time to try the ice cream parlors next door but many people seemed to have checked them out while waiting.\n\nOh yeah if you haven't read the hundreds of reviews notifying you it is cash only, then that ones on you!"}

I had the Chiang Mai noodles and it was one of the best I've had stateside. \n\nThe noodles come out super quickly. The portions are quite large as well. The crispy chicken in the street noodle #1 was quite good, although the sauce was a little sweet and not as balanced as I would've hoped. \n\nThe lemongrass honey iced tea was refreshing and great with the meal as well. They also give you one refill! \n\nI thought that Noodlehead was more of a take-out, hole-in-the-wall but I was pleasantly surprised that the ambiance was so chic + modern. \n\nAll of the noodles are $9.50 which is such a great price!! You shouldn't miss Noodlehead, it lives up to expectations."}

If you are wondering: Yes, Noodlehead IS all it is cracked up to be and you should go. Like, right now. \n\nI went on a cold, cloudy fall afternoon, in need of some delicious noodles to warm my soul. The atmosphere of Noodlehead is cozy meets trendy, with dark wood walls, low lighting, and a mix of big and small tables (in which you may find yourself sharing a larger table with another party). Even for a Saturday around early lunchtime, the place was well on their way to being full.\n\nNow, for the menu. For appetizers, we tried the steamed pork dumplings and the pork belly steam buns. Both were fantastic! The steam buns are made with bao buns, so emulate more of a bao pork sandwich than traditional steamed buns that I am accustomed to, but oh so good! We each ordered a noodle dish to accompany the appetizers: the street noodle 2 and the see yew. The see yew was definitely larger in regard to portion size, but I thought both were well-portioned and ultimately my street noodle 2 was turned into two meals. I really appreciate that you can choose your spice level! This made the experience so much more enjoyable, as I could order a spice level 0 and know that I would fully enjoy my food.\n\nNoodlehead, I will return."}

I will say, this one lacks the fresh toppings that Smiling Banana Leaf adds. Also, while delicious, it was not as traditional tasting. It has the sweeter, richer, cream filled taste that Americanized Thai has. Still good if you're forced to go there, but if you are asked to choose a place, venture out to Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park.\n\nThe Kee Mao was the highlight!

Loved the atmosphere and decor, it appears to be a nice casual date place. Noodlehead must be a local rage because there was a line from the time we got here, waited (30 minutes) and when we left. They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.\n\nVerdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would.

We weren't really hungry but knew we'll need something for dinner since the last time we ate was around 1pm. We went to Millie's Ice Cream and then decided to stop by Noodlehead to pick some stuff up before taking an Uber back to our hotel. Boy was this place busy on a Friday evening! There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.  I lowered the star rating because of the horrible wait and service - we literally ended up waiting about 1.5 hrs total to be seated and for our food."}

I had the See Yew which I highly recommend to anyone trying Thai food for the first time. I also tried my friends Green Curry and it was great! I'll have to get my own plate of it next time I go. They have you choose a spice level from 1-5 and I always go with 2 (sometimes it's hotter than others). They stress that you can always add more spice but not take it away, so choose your spice level with caution. The best part of this restaurant?? Every plate is only $9.50! I still can't believe it. \n\nOther things to note: This restaurant is cash only so keep that in mind. They only seat you if your whole party is present. There tends to be a wait on the weekends, but I'll typically go somewhere else nearby to get a drink while waiting. It is also BYOB with a $0.50 up charge per person. \n\nPlease go check out Noodlehead! You won't regret it."}

(The first two times I was unwilling to wait in an 1+ hour line and decided to go elsewhere). \n\nHonestly I knew it would be good, but was a little skeptical since Noodlehead was recommended by everyone I've talked to and on multiple online blogs and platforms. I chalked it up to Pittsburgh just not having enough Thai places to compare against (which is not true). \n\nI came in with my wife on a Friday about 10 minutes after they opened and there were already several groups seated. We opted for the bar seats by the window and were quickly provided menus and water. \n\nThe menu isn't very extensive, but literally each menu item spoke to me and I wanted to order one of everything. \n\nPrices are VERY reasonable with entrees ranging from $6.50 to $9.50 and appetizers for just a few bucks each. \n\nWe ordered the Love Boat and Street Noodles #1. I really liked the Love Boat and felt like the flavors were akin to traditional pho except that the broth was richer. Just wish there was a little more beef in the dish. \n\nThe Street Noodles were in a sweet and sour sauce with a healthy dash of chili pepper flakes which tied in nice spice. The fried chicken was nicely cooked and still moist too\n\nWill definitely be back, probably during a lunch hour, since the line isn't too outrageous then."}

I obviously had high expectations for Noodlehead and was so excited while waiting for a table (for 45 min) but I felt the food and experience were lackluster. \n\nThe restaurant is incredibly crowded and loud, so it is not a very pleasant atmosphere. We were seated at a bar table by the front window, so it was pretty uncomfortable and I felt like a waiter was going to knock me off my seat the entire time. It also felt very rushed - the waiter was working at super speed, our food appeared in a few minutes, and it just felt like we couldn't relax. \n\nI ordered tofu pad see ew, my go to dish at Thai restaurants. The sauce was so sweet and cloying, it was too heavy. Definitely needed more spice or other flavors to balance out the sugar. The portion was a good size, but smaller than typically found. I was surprised to find that the prices were lower than I usually see for Thai food. \n\nPersonally, I see no reason to return to Noodlehead, as there are plenty of local Thai restaurants with comparable or better food, better service, and a much more pleasant atmosphere."}

We weren't really hungry but knew we'll need something for dinner since the last time we ate was around 1pm. We went to Millie's Ice Cream and then decided to stop by Noodlehead to pick some stuff up before taking an Uber back to our hotel. Boy was this place busy on a Friday evening! There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.  I lowered the star rating because of the horrible wait and service - we literally ended up waiting about 1.5 hrs total to be seated and for our food."}

They only take cash and walk-ins for table service as well as takeout. I cannot handle spicy food so I appreciate that they offer 0-5 spice level from which to choose.

If you're looking for authentic flavors, I'd look else where. A lot of the ingredients used in the dishes are adapted and improvised.

Definitely a cool place BUT I wish they took credit cards and had a shorter wait time. My curry noodle was not as spicy as requested (asked for a 4/5), but still enjoyable. I will say, this one lacks the fresh toppings that Smiling Banana Leaf adds. Also, while delicious, it was not as traditional tasting. It has the sweeter, richer, cream filled taste that Americanized Thai has. Still good if you're forced to go there, but if you are asked to choose a place, venture out to Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park.\n\nThe Kee Mao was the highlight! Street Noodle 2 was different and refreshing, better for summer, sweet but tangy, but not much sauce. The Love Boat was decent, oyster sauces based broth which was hearty and on the sweeter side."}

{"author": "Rowena N.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-08-12", "description": "Noodlehead reminds a little of the Midwest,hipster, small restaurant feel mixed with an east coast busyness and clamor. Loved the atmosphere and decor, it appears to be a nice casual date place. Noodlehead must be a local rage because there was a line from the time we got here, waited (30 minutes) and when we left. They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.\n\nVerdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would. That being said we loved this establishment and the food despite the wait. We didn't have enough time to try the ice cream parlors next door but many people seemed to have checked them out while waiting.\n\nOh yeah if you haven't read the hundreds of reviews notifying you it is cash only, then that ones on you!"}

I had the Chiang Mai noodles and it was one of the best I've had stateside. \n\nThe noodles come out super quickly. The portions are quite large as well. The crispy chicken in the street noodle #1 was quite good, although the sauce was a little sweet and not as balanced as I would've hoped. \n\nThe lemongrass honey iced tea was refreshing and great with the meal as well. They also give you one refill! \n\nI thought that Noodlehead was more of a take-out, hole-in-the-wall but I was pleasantly surprised that the ambiance was so chic + modern. \n\nAll of the noodles are $9.50 which is such a great price!! You shouldn't miss Noodlehead, it lives up to expectations."}

If you are wondering: Yes, Noodlehead IS all it is cracked up to be and you should go. Like, right now. \n\nI went on a cold, cloudy fall afternoon, in need of some delicious noodles to warm my soul. The atmosphere of Noodlehead is cozy meets trendy, with dark wood walls, low lighting, and a mix of big and small tables (in which you may find yourself sharing a larger table with another party). Even for a Saturday around early lunchtime, the place was well on their way to being full.\n\nNow, for the menu. For appetizers, we tried the steamed pork dumplings and the pork belly steam buns. Both were fantastic! The steam buns are made with bao buns, so emulate more of a bao pork sandwich than traditional steamed buns that I am accustomed to, but oh so good! We each ordered a noodle dish to accompany the appetizers: the street noodle 2 and the see yew. The see yew was definitely larger in regard to portion size, but I thought both were well-portioned and ultimately my street noodle 2 was turned into two meals. I really appreciate that you can choose your spice level! This made the experience so much more enjoyable, as I could order a spice level 0 and know that I would fully enjoy my food.\n\nNoodlehead, I will return."}

But it's worth it!  Tasty food with plentiful portions at very reasonable prices. The staff is friendly and efficient. I like the trendy lighting and industrial chic decor. They only take cash and walk-ins for table service as well as takeout. I cannot handle spicy food so I appreciate that they offer 0-5 spice level from which to choose.

Definitely a cool place BUT I wish they took credit cards and had a shorter wait time. My curry noodle was not as spicy as requested (asked for a 4/5), but still enjoyable. I will say, this one lacks the fresh toppings that Smiling Banana Leaf adds. Also, while delicious, it was not as traditional tasting. It has the sweeter, richer, cream filled taste that Americanized Thai has. Still good if you're forced to go there, but if you are asked to choose a place, venture out to Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park.\n\nThe Kee Mao was the highlight! Street Noodle 2 was different and refreshing, better for summer, sweet but tangy, but not much sauce. The Love Boat was decent, oyster sauces based broth which was hearty and on the sweeter side."}

Loved the atmosphere and decor, it appears to be a nice casual date place. Noodlehead must be a local rage because there was a line from the time we got here, waited (30 minutes) and when we left. They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.\n\nVerdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would. That being said we loved this establishment and the food despite the wait. We didn't have enough time to try the ice cream parlors next door but many people seemed to have checked them out while waiting.\n\nOh yeah if you haven't read the hundreds of reviews notifying you it is cash only, then that ones on you!"}

We weren't really hungry but knew we'll need something for dinner since the last time we ate was around 1pm. We went to Millie's Ice Cream and then decided to stop by Noodlehead to pick some stuff up before taking an Uber back to our hotel. Boy was this place busy on a Friday evening! There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.  I lowered the star rating because of the horrible wait and service - we literally ended up waiting about 1.5 hrs total to be seated and for our food."}

{"author": "Julia N.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-11-24", "description": "I LOVE IT HERE!! This is by far my FAVORITE spot for Thai in Pittsburgh. The food is amazing and always served hot.  I had the See Yew which I highly recommend to anyone trying Thai food for the first time. I also tried my friends Green Curry and it was great! I'll have to get my own plate of it next time I go. They have you choose a spice level from 1-5 and I always go with 2 (sometimes it's hotter than others). They stress that you can always add more spice but not take it away, so choose your spice level with caution. The best part of this restaurant?? Every plate is only $9.50! I still can't believe it. \n\nOther things to note: This restaurant is cash only so keep that in mind. They only seat you if your whole party is present. There tends to be a wait on the weekends, but I'll typically go somewhere else nearby to get a drink while waiting. It is also BYOB with a $0.50 up charge per person. \n\nPlease go check out Noodlehead! You won't regret it."}

(The first two times I was unwilling to wait in an 1+ hour line and decided to go elsewhere). \n\nHonestly I knew it would be good, but was a little skeptical since Noodlehead was recommended by everyone I've talked to and on multiple online blogs and platforms. I chalked it up to Pittsburgh just not having enough Thai places to compare against (which is not true). \n\nI came in with my wife on a Friday about 10 minutes after they opened and there were already several groups seated. We opted for the bar seats by the window and were quickly provided menus and water. \n\nThe menu isn't very extensive, but literally each menu item spoke to me and I wanted to order one of everything. \n\nPrices are VERY reasonable with entrees ranging from $6.50 to $9.50 and appetizers for just a few bucks each. \n\nWe ordered the Love Boat and Street Noodles #1. I really liked the Love Boat and felt like the flavors were akin to traditional pho except that the broth was richer. Just wish there was a little more beef in the dish. \n\nThe Street Noodles were in a sweet and sour sauce with a healthy dash of chili pepper flakes which tied in nice spice. The fried chicken was nicely cooked and still moist too\n\nWill definitely be back, probably during a lunch hour, since the line isn't too outrageous then."}

I obviously had high expectations for Noodlehead and was so excited while waiting for a table (for 45 min) but I felt the food and experience were lackluster. \n\nThe restaurant is incredibly crowded and loud, so it is not a very pleasant atmosphere. We were seated at a bar table by the front window, so it was pretty uncomfortable and I felt like a waiter was going to knock me off my seat the entire time. It also felt very rushed - the waiter was working at super speed, our food appeared in a few minutes, and it just felt like we couldn't relax. \n\nI ordered tofu pad see ew, my go to dish at Thai restaurants. The sauce was so sweet and cloying, it was too heavy. Definitely needed more spice or other flavors to balance out the sugar. The portion was a good size, but smaller than typically found. I was surprised to find that the prices were lower than I usually see for Thai food. \n\nPersonally, I see no reason to return to Noodlehead, as there are plenty of local Thai restaurants with comparable or better food, better service, and a much more pleasant atmosphere."}

I would say my personal favorite was the pad see ew, and my boyfriend's favorite was the love boat.

We weren't really hungry but knew we'll need something for dinner since the last time we ate was around 1pm. We went to Millie's Ice Cream and then decided to stop by Noodlehead to pick some stuff up before taking an Uber back to our hotel. Boy was this place busy on a Friday evening! There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.  I lowered the star rating because of the horrible wait and service - we literally ended up waiting about 1.5 hrs total to be seated and for our food."}

But it's worth it!  Tasty food with plentiful portions at very reasonable prices. The staff is friendly and efficient. I like the trendy lighting and industrial chic decor. They only take cash and walk-ins for table service as well as takeout. I cannot handle spicy food so I appreciate that they offer 0-5 spice level from which to choose.

If you're looking for authentic flavors, I'd look else where. A lot of the ingredients used in the dishes are adapted and improvised. The Love Boat tasted nothing like a traditional Thai Boat Noodle, but it was edible. \n\nI tried my friend's Chiang Mai Curry which I think is their version of Khao Soi and it was super sweet even when my friend asked for the Level 4 hotness. \n\nOverall, not too impressed.

Definitely a cool place BUT I wish they took credit cards and had a shorter wait time. My curry noodle was not as spicy as requested (asked for a 4/5), but still enjoyable. I will say, this one lacks the fresh toppings that Smiling Banana Leaf adds. Also, while delicious, it was not as traditional tasting. It has the sweeter, richer, cream filled taste that Americanized Thai has. Still good if you're forced to go there, but if you are asked to choose a place, venture out to Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park.\n\nThe Kee Mao was the highlight! Street Noodle 2 was different and refreshing, better for summer, sweet but tangy, but not much sauce. The Love Boat was decent, oyster sauces based broth which was hearty and on the sweeter side."}

{"author": "Rowena N.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-08-12", "description": "Noodlehead reminds a little of the Midwest,hipster, small restaurant feel mixed with an east coast busyness and clamor. Loved the atmosphere and decor, it appears to be a nice casual date place. Noodlehead must be a local rage because there was a line from the time we got here, waited (30 minutes) and when we left. They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.\n\nVerdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would. That being said we loved this establishment and the food despite the wait. We didn't have enough time to try the ice cream parlors next door but many people seemed to have checked them out while waiting.\n\nOh yeah if you haven't read the hundreds of reviews notifying you it is cash only, then that ones on you!"}

I had the Chiang Mai noodles and it was one of the best I've had stateside. \n\nThe noodles come out super quickly. The portions are quite large as well. The crispy chicken in the street noodle #1 was quite good, although the sauce was a little sweet and not as balanced as I would've hoped. \n\nThe lemongrass honey iced tea was refreshing and great with the meal as well. They also give you one refill! \n\nI thought that Noodlehead was more of a take-out, hole-in-the-wall but I was pleasantly surprised that the ambiance was so chic + modern. \n\nAll of the noodles are $9.50 which is such a great price!! You shouldn't miss Noodlehead, it lives up to expectations."}

If you are wondering: Yes, Noodlehead IS all it is cracked up to be and you should go. Like, right now. \n\nI went on a cold, cloudy fall afternoon, in need of some delicious noodles to warm my soul. The atmosphere of Noodlehead is cozy meets trendy, with dark wood walls, low lighting, and a mix of big and small tables (in which you may find yourself sharing a larger table with another party). Even for a Saturday around early lunchtime, the place was well on their way to being full.\n\nNow, for the menu. For appetizers, we tried the steamed pork dumplings and the pork belly steam buns. Both were fantastic! The steam buns are made with bao buns, so emulate more of a bao pork sandwich than traditional steamed buns that I am accustomed to, but oh so good! We each ordered a noodle dish to accompany the appetizers: the street noodle 2 and the see yew. The see yew was definitely larger in regard to portion size, but I thought both were well-portioned and ultimately my street noodle 2 was turned into two meals. I really appreciate that you can choose your spice level! This made the experience so much more enjoyable, as I could order a spice level 0 and know that I would fully enjoy my food.\n\nNoodlehead, I will return."}

Definitely a cool place BUT I wish they took credit cards and had a shorter wait time. My curry noodle was not as spicy as requested (asked for a 4/5), but still enjoyable. I will say, this one lacks the fresh toppings that Smiling Banana Leaf adds. Also, while delicious, it was not as traditional tasting. It has the sweeter, richer, cream filled taste that Americanized Thai has. Still good if you're forced to go there, but if you are asked to choose a place, venture out to Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park.\n\nThe Kee Mao was the highlight! Street Noodle 2 was different and refreshing, better for summer, sweet but tangy, but not much sauce. The Love Boat was decent, oyster sauces based broth which was hearty and on the sweeter side."}

Loved the atmosphere and decor, it appears to be a nice casual date place. Noodlehead must be a local rage because there was a line from the time we got here, waited (30 minutes) and when we left. They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.\n\nVerdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would.

We weren't really hungry but knew we'll need something for dinner since the last time we ate was around 1pm. We went to Millie's Ice Cream and then decided to stop by Noodlehead to pick some stuff up before taking an Uber back to our hotel. Boy was this place busy on a Friday evening! There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.  I lowered the star rating because of the horrible wait and service - we literally ended up waiting about 1.5 hrs total to be seated and for our food."}

I had the See Yew which I highly recommend to anyone trying Thai food for the first time. I also tried my friends Green Curry and it was great! I'll have to get my own plate of it next time I go. They have you choose a spice level from 1-5 and I always go with 2 (sometimes it's hotter than others). They stress that you can always add more spice but not take it away, so choose your spice level with caution. The best part of this restaurant?? Every plate is only $9.50! I still can't believe it. \n\nOther things to note: This restaurant is cash only so keep that in mind. They only seat you if your whole party is present. There tends to be a wait on the weekends, but I'll typically go somewhere else nearby to get a drink while waiting. It is also BYOB with a $0.50 up charge per person. \n\nPlease go check out Noodlehead! You won't regret it."}

(The first two times I was unwilling to wait in an 1+ hour line and decided to go elsewhere). \n\nHonestly I knew it would be good, but was a little skeptical since Noodlehead was recommended by everyone I've talked to and on multiple online blogs and platforms. I chalked it up to Pittsburgh just not having enough Thai places to compare against (which is not true). \n\nI came in with my wife on a Friday about 10 minutes after they opened and there were already several groups seated. We opted for the bar seats by the window and were quickly provided menus and water. \n\nThe menu isn't very extensive, but literally each menu item spoke to me and I wanted to order one of everything. \n\nPrices are VERY reasonable with entrees ranging from $6.50 to $9.50 and appetizers for just a few bucks each. \n\nWe ordered the Love Boat and Street Noodles #1. I really liked the Love Boat and felt like the flavors were akin to traditional pho except that the broth was richer. Just wish there was a little more beef in the dish. \n\nThe Street Noodles were in a sweet and sour sauce with a healthy dash of chili pepper flakes which tied in nice spice.

We were seated at a bar table by the front window, so it was pretty uncomfortable and I felt like a waiter was going to knock me off my seat the entire time. It also felt very rushed - the waiter was working at super speed, our food appeared in a few minutes, and it just felt like we couldn't relax. \n\nI ordered tofu pad see ew, my go to dish at Thai restaurants. The sauce was so sweet and cloying, it was too heavy. Definitely needed more spice or other flavors to balance out the sugar. The portion was a good size, but smaller than typically found.

We weren't really hungry but knew we'll need something for dinner since the last time we ate was around 1pm. We went to Millie's Ice Cream and then decided to stop by Noodlehead to pick some stuff up before taking an Uber back to our hotel. Boy was this place busy on a Friday evening! There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.  I lowered the star rating because of the horrible wait and service - we literally ended up waiting about 1.5 hrs total to be seated and for our food."}

They only take cash and walk-ins for table service as well as takeout. I cannot handle spicy food so I appreciate that they offer 0-5 spice level from which to choose.

If you're looking for authentic flavors, I'd look else where. A lot of the ingredients used in the dishes are adapted and improvised. The Love Boat tasted nothing like a traditional Thai Boat Noodle, but it was edible. \n\nI tried my friend's Chiang Mai Curry which I think is their version of Khao Soi and it was super sweet even when my friend asked for the Level 4 hotness. \n\nOverall, not too impressed.

Definitely a cool place BUT I wish they took credit cards and had a shorter wait time. My curry noodle was not as spicy as requested (asked for a 4/5), but still enjoyable. I will say, this one lacks the fresh toppings that Smiling Banana Leaf adds. Also, while delicious, it was not as traditional tasting. It has the sweeter, richer, cream filled taste that Americanized Thai has. Still good if you're forced to go there, but if you are asked to choose a place, venture out to Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park.\n\nThe Kee Mao was the highlight! Street Noodle 2 was different and refreshing, better for summer, sweet but tangy, but not much sauce. The Love Boat was decent, oyster sauces based broth which was hearty and on the sweeter side."}

{"author": "Rowena N.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-08-12", "description": "Noodlehead reminds a little of the Midwest,hipster, small restaurant feel mixed with an east coast busyness and clamor. Loved the atmosphere and decor, it appears to be a nice casual date place. Noodlehead must be a local rage because there was a line from the time we got here, waited (30 minutes) and when we left. They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.\n\nVerdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would. That being said we loved this establishment and the food despite the wait. We didn't have enough time to try the ice cream parlors next door but many people seemed to have checked them out while waiting.\n\nOh yeah if you haven't read the hundreds of reviews notifying you it is cash only, then that ones on you!"}

I had the Chiang Mai noodles and it was one of the best I've had stateside. \n\nThe noodles come out super quickly. The portions are quite large as well. The crispy chicken in the street noodle #1 was quite good, although the sauce was a little sweet and not as balanced as I would've hoped. \n\nThe lemongrass honey iced tea was refreshing and great with the meal as well. They also give you one refill! \n\nI thought that Noodlehead was more of a take-out, hole-in-the-wall but I was pleasantly surprised that the ambiance was so chic + modern. \n\nAll of the noodles are $9.50 which is such a great price!!

If you are wondering: Yes, Noodlehead IS all it is cracked up to be and you should go. Like, right now. \n\nI went on a cold, cloudy fall afternoon, in need of some delicious noodles to warm my soul. The atmosphere of Noodlehead is cozy meets trendy, with dark wood walls, low lighting, and a mix of big and small tables (in which you may find yourself sharing a larger table with another party). Even for a Saturday around early lunchtime, the place was well on their way to being full.\n\nNow, for the menu. For appetizers, we tried the steamed pork dumplings and the pork belly steam buns. Both were fantastic! The steam buns are made with bao buns, so emulate more of a bao pork sandwich than traditional steamed buns that I am accustomed to, but oh so good! We each ordered a noodle dish to accompany the appetizers: the street noodle 2 and the see yew. The see yew was definitely larger in regard to portion size, but I thought both were well-portioned and ultimately my street noodle 2 was turned into two meals. I really appreciate that you can choose your spice level! This made the experience so much more enjoyable, as I could order a spice level 0 and know that I would fully enjoy my food.\n\nNoodlehead, I will return."}

It has the sweeter, richer, cream filled taste that Americanized Thai has. Still good if you're forced to go there, but if you are asked to choose a place, venture out to Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park.\n\nThe Kee Mao was the highlight!

Loved the atmosphere and decor, it appears to be a nice casual date place. Noodlehead must be a local rage because there was a line from the time we got here, waited (30 minutes) and when we left. They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.\n\nVerdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would.

The portion size was perfect, everything was flavorful, and the ingredients were fresh. The food here definitely tastes more authentic Asian; no shying away from strong herbs and spices.

We weren't really hungry but knew we'll need something for dinner since the last time we ate was around 1pm. We went to Millie's Ice Cream and then decided to stop by Noodlehead to pick some stuff up before taking an Uber back to our hotel. Boy was this place busy on a Friday evening! There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.  I lowered the star rating because of the horrible wait and service - we literally ended up waiting about 1.5 hrs total to be seated and for our food."}

I had the See Yew which I highly recommend to anyone trying Thai food for the first time. I also tried my friends Green Curry and it was great! I'll have to get my own plate of it next time I go. They have you choose a spice level from 1-5 and I always go with 2 (sometimes it's hotter than others). They stress that you can always add more spice but not take it away, so choose your spice level with caution. The best part of this restaurant?? Every plate is only $9.50! I still can't believe it. \n\nOther things to note: This restaurant is cash only so keep that in mind. They only seat you if your whole party is present. There tends to be a wait on the weekends, but I'll typically go somewhere else nearby to get a drink while waiting. It is also BYOB with a $0.50 up charge per person. \n\nPlease go check out Noodlehead! You won't regret it."}

(The first two times I was unwilling to wait in an 1+ hour line and decided to go elsewhere). \n\nHonestly I knew it would be good, but was a little skeptical since Noodlehead was recommended by everyone I've talked to and on multiple online blogs and platforms. I chalked it up to Pittsburgh just not having enough Thai places to compare against (which is not true). \n\nI came in with my wife on a Friday about 10 minutes after they opened and there were already several groups seated. We opted for the bar seats by the window and were quickly provided menus and water. \n\nThe menu isn't very extensive, but literally each menu item spoke to me and I wanted to order one of everything. \n\nPrices are VERY reasonable with entrees ranging from $6.50 to $9.50 and appetizers for just a few bucks each. \n\nWe ordered the Love Boat and Street Noodles #1. I really liked the Love Boat and felt like the flavors were akin to traditional pho except that the broth was richer. Just wish there was a little more beef in the dish. \n\nThe Street Noodles were in a sweet and sour sauce with a healthy dash of chili pepper flakes which tied in nice spice.

The sauce was so sweet and cloying, it was too heavy. Definitely needed more spice or other flavors to balance out the sugar. The portion was a good size, but smaller than typically found.

We weren't really hungry but knew we'll need something for dinner since the last time we ate was around 1pm. We went to Millie's Ice Cream and then decided to stop by Noodlehead to pick some stuff up before taking an Uber back to our hotel. Boy was this place busy on a Friday evening! There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.

I would say my personal favorite was the pad see ew, and my boyfriend's favorite was the love boat.

But it's worth it!  Tasty food with plentiful portions at very reasonable prices. The staff is friendly and efficient. I like the trendy lighting and industrial chic decor. They only take cash and walk-ins for table service as well as takeout. I cannot handle spicy food so I appreciate that they offer 0-5 spice level from which to choose.

If you're looking for authentic flavors, I'd look else where. A lot of the ingredients used in the dishes are adapted and improvised. The Love Boat tasted nothing like a traditional Thai Boat Noodle, but it was edible. \n\nI tried my friend's Chiang Mai Curry which I think is their version of Khao Soi and it was super sweet even when my friend asked for the Level 4 hotness. \n\nOverall, not too impressed.

Definitely a cool place BUT I wish they took credit cards and had a shorter wait time. My curry noodle was not as spicy as requested (asked for a 4/5), but still enjoyable. I will say, this one lacks the fresh toppings that Smiling Banana Leaf adds. Also, while delicious, it was not as traditional tasting. It has the sweeter, richer, cream filled taste that Americanized Thai has. Still good if you're forced to go there, but if you are asked to choose a place, venture out to Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park.\n\nThe Kee Mao was the highlight! Street Noodle 2 was different and refreshing, better for summer, sweet but tangy, but not much sauce. The Love Boat was decent, oyster sauces based broth which was hearty and on the sweeter side."}

{"author": "Rowena N.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-08-12", "description": "Noodlehead reminds a little of the Midwest,hipster, small restaurant feel mixed with an east coast busyness and clamor. Loved the atmosphere and decor, it appears to be a nice casual date place. Noodlehead must be a local rage because there was a line from the time we got here, waited (30 minutes) and when we left. They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.\n\nVerdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would. That being said we loved this establishment and the food despite the wait. We didn't have enough time to try the ice cream parlors next door but many people seemed to have checked them out while waiting.\n\nOh yeah if you haven't read the hundreds of reviews notifying you it is cash only, then that ones on you!"}

I had the Chiang Mai noodles and it was one of the best I've had stateside. \n\nThe noodles come out super quickly. The portions are quite large as well. The crispy chicken in the street noodle #1 was quite good, although the sauce was a little sweet and not as balanced as I would've hoped. \n\nThe lemongrass honey iced tea was refreshing and great with the meal as well. They also give you one refill! \n\nI thought that Noodlehead was more of a take-out, hole-in-the-wall but I was pleasantly surprised that the ambiance was so chic + modern. \n\nAll of the noodles are $9.50 which is such a great price!!

If you are wondering: Yes, Noodlehead IS all it is cracked up to be and you should go. Like, right now. \n\nI went on a cold, cloudy fall afternoon, in need of some delicious noodles to warm my soul. The atmosphere of Noodlehead is cozy meets trendy, with dark wood walls, low lighting, and a mix of big and small tables (in which you may find yourself sharing a larger table with another party). Even for a Saturday around early lunchtime, the place was well on their way to being full.\n\nNow, for the menu. For appetizers, we tried the steamed pork dumplings and the pork belly steam buns. Both were fantastic! The steam buns are made with bao buns, so emulate more of a bao pork sandwich than traditional steamed buns that I am accustomed to, but oh so good! We each ordered a noodle dish to accompany the appetizers: the street noodle 2 and the see yew. The see yew was definitely larger in regard to portion size, but I thought both were well-portioned and ultimately my street noodle 2 was turned into two meals. I really appreciate that you can choose your spice level! This made the experience so much more enjoyable, as I could order a spice level 0 and know that I would fully enjoy my food.\n\nNoodlehead, I will return."}

Loved the atmosphere and decor, it appears to be a nice casual date place. Noodlehead must be a local rage because there was a line from the time we got here, waited (30 minutes) and when we left. They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.\n\nVerdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would.

The portion size was perfect, everything was flavorful, and the ingredients were fresh. The food here definitely tastes more authentic Asian; no shying away from strong herbs and spices.

We weren't really hungry but knew we'll need something for dinner since the last time we ate was around 1pm. We went to Millie's Ice Cream and then decided to stop by Noodlehead to pick some stuff up before taking an Uber back to our hotel. Boy was this place busy on a Friday evening! There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.  I lowered the star rating because of the horrible wait and service - we literally ended up waiting about 1.5 hrs total to be seated and for our food."}

I had the See Yew which I highly recommend to anyone trying Thai food for the first time. I also tried my friends Green Curry and it was great! I'll have to get my own plate of it next time I go. They have you choose a spice level from 1-5 and I always go with 2 (sometimes it's hotter than others). They stress that you can always add more spice but not take it away, so choose your spice level with caution. The best part of this restaurant?? Every plate is only $9.50! I still can't believe it. \n\nOther things to note: This restaurant is cash only so keep that in mind. They only seat you if your whole party is present. There tends to be a wait on the weekends, but I'll typically go somewhere else nearby to get a drink while waiting. It is also BYOB with a $0.50 up charge per person. \n\nPlease go check out Noodlehead! You won't regret it."}

(The first two times I was unwilling to wait in an 1+ hour line and decided to go elsewhere). \n\nHonestly I knew it would be good, but was a little skeptical since Noodlehead was recommended by everyone I've talked to and on multiple online blogs and platforms. I chalked it up to Pittsburgh just not having enough Thai places to compare against (which is not true). \n\nI came in with my wife on a Friday about 10 minutes after they opened and there were already several groups seated. We opted for the bar seats by the window and were quickly provided menus and water. \n\nThe menu isn't very extensive, but literally each menu item spoke to me and I wanted to order one of everything. \n\nPrices are VERY reasonable with entrees ranging from $6.50 to $9.50 and appetizers for just a few bucks each. \n\nWe ordered the Love Boat and Street Noodles #1. I really liked the Love Boat and felt like the flavors were akin to traditional pho except that the broth was richer. Just wish there was a little more beef in the dish. \n\nThe Street Noodles were in a sweet and sour sauce with a healthy dash of chili pepper flakes which tied in nice spice.

We weren't really hungry but knew we'll need something for dinner since the last time we ate was around 1pm. We went to Millie's Ice Cream and then decided to stop by Noodlehead to pick some stuff up before taking an Uber back to our hotel. Boy was this place busy on a Friday evening! There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.  I lowered the star rating because of the horrible wait and service - we literally ended up waiting about 1.5 hrs total to be seated and for our food."}

I obviously had high expectations for Noodlehead and was so excited while waiting for a table (for 45 min) but I felt the food and experience were lackluster. \n\nThe restaurant is incredibly crowded and loud, so it is not a very pleasant atmosphere. We were seated at a bar table by the front window, so it was pretty uncomfortable and I felt like a waiter was going to knock me off my seat the entire time. It also felt very rushed - the waiter was working at super speed, our food appeared in a few minutes, and it just felt like we couldn't relax. \n\nI ordered tofu pad see ew, my go to dish at Thai restaurants. The sauce was so sweet and cloying, it was too heavy. Definitely needed more spice or other flavors to balance out the sugar. The portion was a good size, but smaller than typically found. I was surprised to find that the prices were lower than I usually see for Thai food. \n\nPersonally, I see no reason to return to Noodlehead, as there are plenty of local Thai restaurants with comparable or better food, better service, and a much more pleasant atmosphere."}

We ended up getting: the love boat, the pork baos, pad Thai, pad see ew, and the curry noodles. (There were a lot of leftovers). Everything was so delicious it's hard to go wrong with any choice. I would say my personal favorite was the pad see ew, and my boyfriend's favorite was the love boat. The only thing I would have to say is misleading is the spice level-- the dishes weren't as spicy as I was expecting them to be! \n\nThe service was fantastic the whole night and it was just a great atmosphere to dine on a Friday night.

But it's worth it!  Tasty food with plentiful portions at very reasonable prices. The staff is friendly and efficient. I like the trendy lighting and industrial chic decor. They only take cash and walk-ins for table service as well as takeout. I cannot handle spicy food so I appreciate that they offer 0-5 spice level from which to choose. Parking can be a pain in this section of Shadyside on S Highland so close to East Liberty but it is only a short walk from the East Busway."}
{"author": "Ploy N.", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2019-09-14", "description": "Personally, felt that the place had a snobby atmosphere to it but also maybe I was being extra judgemental because it claims to serve \"Thai\" food.\n\nFood was good but definitely not \"Thai\". If you're looking for authentic flavors, I'd look else where. A lot of the ingredients used in the dishes are adapted and improvised. The Love Boat tasted nothing like a traditional Thai Boat Noodle, but it was edible. \n\nI tried my friend's Chiang Mai Curry which I think is their version of Khao Soi and it was super sweet even when my friend asked for the Level 4 hotness. \n\nOverall, not too impressed. Prices might be good for the area and their portion but don't think I'd really recommend this place to anyone who's looking for good Thai food."}
{"author": "Sahil N.", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2019-11-07", "description": "Had a Spontaneous Saturday Lunch here. Definitely a cool place BUT I wish they took credit cards and had a shorter wait time. My curry noodle was not as spicy as requested (asked for a 4/5), but still enjoyable. I will say, this one lacks the fresh toppings that Smiling Banana Leaf adds. Also, while delicious, it was not as traditional tasting. It has the sweeter, richer, cream filled taste that Americanized Thai has. Still good if you're forced to go there, but if you are asked to choose a place, venture out to Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park.\n\nThe Kee Mao was the highlight! Street Noodle 2 was different and refreshing, better for summer, sweet but tangy, but not much sauce. The Love Boat was decent, oyster sauces based broth which was hearty and on the sweeter side."}

{"author": "Rowena N.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-08-12", "description": "Noodlehead reminds a little of the Midwest,hipster, small restaurant feel mixed with an east coast busyness and clamor. Loved the atmosphere and decor, it appears to be a nice casual date place. Noodlehead must be a local rage because there was a line from the time we got here, waited (30 minutes) and when we left. They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.\n\nVerdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would. That being said we loved this establishment and the food despite the wait. We didn't have enough time to try the ice cream parlors next door but many people seemed to have checked them out while waiting.\n\nOh yeah if you haven't read the hundreds of reviews notifying you it is cash only, then that ones on you!"}

I had the Chiang Mai noodles and it was one of the best I've had stateside. \n\nThe noodles come out super quickly. The portions are quite large as well. The crispy chicken in the street noodle #1 was quite good, although the sauce was a little sweet and not as balanced as I would've hoped. \n\nThe lemongrass honey iced tea was refreshing and great with the meal as well. They also give you one refill! \n\nI thought that Noodlehead was more of a take-out, hole-in-the-wall but I was pleasantly surprised that the ambiance was so chic + modern. \n\nAll of the noodles are $9.50 which is such a great price!!

If you are wondering: Yes, Noodlehead IS all it is cracked up to be and you should go. Like, right now. \n\nI went on a cold, cloudy fall afternoon, in need of some delicious noodles to warm my soul. The atmosphere of Noodlehead is cozy meets trendy, with dark wood walls, low lighting, and a mix of big and small tables (in which you may find yourself sharing a larger table with another party). Even for a Saturday around early lunchtime, the place was well on their way to being full.\n\nNow, for the menu. For appetizers, we tried the steamed pork dumplings and the pork belly steam buns. Both were fantastic! The steam buns are made with bao buns, so emulate more of a bao pork sandwich than traditional steamed buns that I am accustomed to, but oh so good! We each ordered a noodle dish to accompany the appetizers: the street noodle 2 and the see yew. The see yew was definitely larger in regard to portion size, but I thought both were well-portioned and ultimately my street noodle 2 was turned into two meals. I really appreciate that you can choose your spice level! This made the experience so much more enjoyable, as I could order a spice level 0 and know that I would fully enjoy my food.\n\nNoodlehead, I will return."}

It also felt very rushed - the waiter was working at super speed, our food appeared in a few minutes, and it just felt like we couldn't relax. \n\nI ordered tofu pad see ew, my go to dish at Thai restaurants. The sauce was so sweet and cloying, it was too heavy. Definitely needed more spice or other flavors to balance out the sugar. The portion was a good size, but smaller than typically found. I was surprised to find that the prices were lower than I usually see for Thai food. \n\nPersonally, I see no reason to return to Noodlehead, as there are plenty of local Thai restaurants with comparable or better food, better service, and a much more pleasant atmosphere."}

Loved the atmosphere and decor, it appears to be a nice casual date place. Noodlehead must be a local rage because there was a line from the time we got here, waited (30 minutes) and when we left. They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.\n\nVerdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would.

The portion size was perfect, everything was flavorful, and the ingredients were fresh. The food here definitely tastes more authentic Asian; no shying away from strong herbs and spices.

We weren't really hungry but knew we'll need something for dinner since the last time we ate was around 1pm. We went to Millie's Ice Cream and then decided to stop by Noodlehead to pick some stuff up before taking an Uber back to our hotel. Boy was this place busy on a Friday evening! There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.  I lowered the star rating because of the horrible wait and service - we literally ended up waiting about 1.5 hrs total to be seated and for our food."}

I had the See Yew which I highly recommend to anyone trying Thai food for the first time. I also tried my friends Green Curry and it was great! I'll have to get my own plate of it next time I go. They have you choose a spice level from 1-5 and I always go with 2 (sometimes it's hotter than others). They stress that you can always add more spice but not take it away, so choose your spice level with caution. The best part of this restaurant?? Every plate is only $9.50! I still can't believe it. \n\nOther things to note: This restaurant is cash only so keep that in mind. They only seat you if your whole party is present. There tends to be a wait on the weekends, but I'll typically go somewhere else nearby to get a drink while waiting. It is also BYOB with a $0.50 up charge per person. \n\nPlease go check out Noodlehead! You won't regret it."}

(The first two times I was unwilling to wait in an 1+ hour line and decided to go elsewhere). \n\nHonestly I knew it would be good, but was a little skeptical since Noodlehead was recommended by everyone I've talked to and on multiple online blogs and platforms. I chalked it up to Pittsburgh just not having enough Thai places to compare against (which is not true). \n\nI came in with my wife on a Friday about 10 minutes after they opened and there were already several groups seated. We opted for the bar seats by the window and were quickly provided menus and water. \n\nThe menu isn't very extensive, but literally each menu item spoke to me and I wanted to order one of everything. \n\nPrices are VERY reasonable with entrees ranging from $6.50 to $9.50 and appetizers for just a few bucks each. \n\nWe ordered the Love Boat and Street Noodles #1. I really liked the Love Boat and felt like the flavors were akin to traditional pho except that the broth was richer. Just wish there was a little more beef in the dish. \n\nThe Street Noodles were in a sweet and sour sauce with a healthy dash of chili pepper flakes which tied in nice spice.

We weren't really hungry but knew we'll need something for dinner since the last time we ate was around 1pm. We went to Millie's Ice Cream and then decided to stop by Noodlehead to pick some stuff up before taking an Uber back to our hotel. Boy was this place busy on a Friday evening! There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.

I obviously had high expectations for Noodlehead and was so excited while waiting for a table (for 45 min) but I felt the food and experience were lackluster. \n\nThe restaurant is incredibly crowded and loud, so it is not a very pleasant atmosphere. We were seated at a bar table by the front window, so it was pretty uncomfortable and I felt like a waiter was going to knock me off my seat the entire time. It also felt very rushed - the waiter was working at super speed, our food appeared in a few minutes, and it just felt like we couldn't relax. \n\nI ordered tofu pad see ew, my go to dish at Thai restaurants. The sauce was so sweet and cloying, it was too heavy. Definitely needed more spice or other flavors to balance out the sugar. The portion was a good size, but smaller than typically found. I was surprised to find that the prices were lower than I usually see for Thai food. \n\nPersonally, I see no reason to return to Noodlehead, as there are plenty of local Thai restaurants with comparable or better food, better service, and a much more pleasant atmosphere."}

We ended up getting: the love boat, the pork baos, pad Thai, pad see ew, and the curry noodles. (There were a lot of leftovers). Everything was so delicious it's hard to go wrong with any choice. I would say my personal favorite was the pad see ew, and my boyfriend's favorite was the love boat. The only thing I would have to say is misleading is the spice level-- the dishes weren't as spicy as I was expecting them to be! \n\nThe service was fantastic the whole night and it was just a great atmosphere to dine on a Friday night.

They only take cash and walk-ins for table service as well as takeout. I cannot handle spicy food so I appreciate that they offer 0-5 spice level from which to choose.

If you're looking for authentic flavors, I'd look else where. A lot of the ingredients used in the dishes are adapted and improvised. The Love Boat tasted nothing like a traditional Thai Boat Noodle, but it was edible. \n\nI tried my friend's Chiang Mai Curry which I think is their version of Khao Soi and it was super sweet even when my friend asked for the Level 4 hotness. \n\nOverall, not too impressed. Prices might be good for the area and their portion but don't think I'd really recommend this place to anyone who's looking for good Thai food."}
{"author": "Sahil N.", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2019-11-07", "description": "Had a Spontaneous Saturday Lunch here. Definitely a cool place BUT I wish they took credit cards and had a shorter wait time. My curry noodle was not as spicy as requested (asked for a 4/5), but still enjoyable. I will say, this one lacks the fresh toppings that Smiling Banana Leaf adds. Also, while delicious, it was not as traditional tasting. It has the sweeter, richer, cream filled taste that Americanized Thai has. Still good if you're forced to go there, but if you are asked to choose a place, venture out to Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park.\n\nThe Kee Mao was the highlight! Street Noodle 2 was different and refreshing, better for summer, sweet but tangy, but not much sauce. The Love Boat was decent, oyster sauces based broth which was hearty and on the sweeter side."}

{"author": "Rowena N.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2019-08-12", "description": "Noodlehead reminds a little of the Midwest,hipster, small restaurant feel mixed with an east coast busyness and clamor. Loved the atmosphere and decor, it appears to be a nice casual date place. Noodlehead must be a local rage because there was a line from the time we got here, waited (30 minutes) and when we left. They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.\n\nVerdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would. That being said we loved this establishment and the food despite the wait. We didn't have enough time to try the ice cream parlors next door but many people seemed to have checked them out while waiting.\n\nOh yeah if you haven't read the hundreds of reviews notifying you it is cash only, then that ones on you!"}

I had the Chiang Mai noodles and it was one of the best I've had stateside. \n\nThe noodles come out super quickly. The portions are quite large as well. The crispy chicken in the street noodle #1 was quite good, although the sauce was a little sweet and not as balanced as I would've hoped. \n\nThe lemongrass honey iced tea was refreshing and great with the meal as well. They also give you one refill! \n\nI thought that Noodlehead was more of a take-out, hole-in-the-wall but I was pleasantly surprised that the ambiance was so chic + modern. \n\nAll of the noodles are $9.50 which is such a great price!!

The atmosphere of Noodlehead is cozy meets trendy, with dark wood walls, low lighting, and a mix of big and small tables (in which you may find yourself sharing a larger table with another party). Even for a Saturday around early lunchtime, the place was well on their way to being full.\n\nNow, for the menu. For appetizers, we tried the steamed pork dumplings and the pork belly steam buns. Both were fantastic! The steam buns are made with bao buns, so emulate more of a bao pork sandwich than traditional steamed buns that I am accustomed to, but oh so good! We each ordered a noodle dish to accompany the appetizers: the street noodle 2 and the see yew. The see yew was definitely larger in regard to portion size, but I thought both were well-portioned and ultimately my street noodle 2 was turned into two meals. I really appreciate that you can choose your spice level! This made the experience so much more enjoyable, as I could order a spice level 0 and know that I would fully enjoy my food.\n\nNoodlehead, I will return."}

Loved the atmosphere and decor, it appears to be a nice casual date place. Noodlehead must be a local rage because there was a line from the time we got here, waited (30 minutes) and when we left. They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes. \n\nThe Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.\n\nThe second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.\n\nThe only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.\n\nVerdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would. That being said we loved this establishment and the food despite the wait.

The portion size was perfect, everything was flavorful, and the ingredients were fresh. The food here definitely tastes more authentic Asian; no shying away from strong herbs and spices.

We weren't really hungry but knew we'll need something for dinner since the last time we ate was around 1pm. We went to Millie's Ice Cream and then decided to stop by Noodlehead to pick some stuff up before taking an Uber back to our hotel. Boy was this place busy on a Friday evening! There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.  I lowered the star rating because of the horrible wait and service - we literally ended up waiting about 1.5 hrs total to be seated and for our food."}

I had the See Yew which I highly recommend to anyone trying Thai food for the first time. I also tried my friends Green Curry and it was great! I'll have to get my own plate of it next time I go. They have you choose a spice level from 1-5 and I always go with 2 (sometimes it's hotter than others). They stress that you can always add more spice but not take it away, so choose your spice level with caution. The best part of this restaurant?? Every plate is only $9.50! I still can't believe it. \n\nOther things to note: This restaurant is cash only so keep that in mind. They only seat you if your whole party is present. There tends to be a wait on the weekends, but I'll typically go somewhere else nearby to get a drink while waiting. It is also BYOB with a $0.50 up charge per person. \n\nPlease go check out Noodlehead! You won't regret it."}

I chalked it up to Pittsburgh just not having enough Thai places to compare against (which is not true). \n\nI came in with my wife on a Friday about 10 minutes after they opened and there were already several groups seated. We opted for the bar seats by the window and were quickly provided menus and water. \n\nThe menu isn't very extensive, but literally each menu item spoke to me and I wanted to order one of everything. \n\nPrices are VERY reasonable with entrees ranging from $6.50 to $9.50 and appetizers for just a few bucks each. \n\nWe ordered the Love Boat and Street Noodles #1. I really liked the Love Boat and felt like the flavors were akin to traditional pho except that the broth was richer.

I really appreciate that you can choose your spice level! This made the experience so much more enjoyable, as I could order a spice level 0 and know that I would fully enjoy my food.\n\nNoodlehead, I will return."}

My only complaint is the wait, which can go up to an hour if you don't get there early. The place is definitely poppin'. \n\n*FAVORITES*\nStreet Noodle 1\nKee Mao\nSee Yew"}

They have excellent prices and BYOB! You can get an app, entree and drink for $20! My favorite is the shrimp See You!  They do not go light on the shrimp either! You can pick your spice level from 0-5! This is cash only - but have a ATM in the back if needed. The servers are always so nice!"}

The restaurant was really dark and relatively small, and the person at the counter was a bit indifferent.\n\nWe sat at the tabletop seats (where it was the brightest) and it took a while for our waitress to notice we were ready to order. \nWe ordered a Sukothai noodle (spicy level 4: Thai hot), Street noodle #1 (spicy level: medium), and spring rolls. \nYou can choose your spicy level (not hot ~ crazy hot). \n\nThe food was SOOOOOO DELICIOUS. The portion size was perfect, everything was flavorful, and the ingredients were fresh. The food here definitely tastes more authentic Asian; no shying away from strong herbs and spices. It reminded me of my trips to Southeast Asia. \nAlthough the service wasn't the best, the food ABSOLUTELY made up for it!!!!\nStrongly recommend!!!"}

We weren't really hungry but knew we'll need something for dinner since the last time we ate was around 1pm. We went to Millie's Ice Cream and then decided to stop by Noodlehead to pick some stuff up before taking an Uber back to our hotel. Boy was this place busy on a Friday evening! There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night!\n___________\n\nActually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.  I lowered the star rating because of the horrible wait and service - we literally ended up waiting about 1.5 hrs total to be seated and for our food."}

The person serving me was not at all friendly and the staff, in general, did not seem overly friendly.\n\nAs for the ice cream, the Vietnamese coffee was amazing and probably the best coffee-flavored ice cream I've had. The best chocolate was not really that great, and the incline cherry was bad.\n\nIt's hard to not enjoy ice cream and by all means I did enjoy my treat even if it overall wasn't to die for (sans the Vietnamese coffee). Those who follow my reviews do however know that I carefully weigh attitude and demeanor of the staff.

There was a short line when we came on a hot summer night but it moved quickly. They list all the flavors on the board facing you as you stand in line so you have plenty of time to make a decision. They do give you samples if you ask for it! I tried the peanut butter and the mint, can't say I liked either of them. The peanut butter tasted a bit too salty and the mint was creamy, but a bit bland. I ended up ordering two small scoops of mint and coffee in a cone. Didn't want to hold up the line and try anymore. The coffee was way sweet and ended up being monotonous after the first few bites. I tried the rest of the fam's flavors and the mango gelato was pretty good. The blueberry sorbet was way tart but refreshing. The best thing about this place was the freshly made waffle cones! I liked the strong cinnamon and spices you can taste in the cone. They were crispy and on the thinner side so didn't feel like it was too much. But at $26 for 4 people, it's a bit steep for mediocre ice cream! I've had better - the flavors need to stand out and be a bit stronger! Plus for it being right next to Noodlehead though cause it makes a good dinner/dessert option!"}

I was thinking similar thoughts after a bite of their salted cookie dough ice cream. I had recently had cookie dough ice cream at my favorite ice cream shop near my house, shoutout to Graeters. I have to admit that Ms. Millie could teach Mr. Graeter about how to make a good cookie dough ice cream because this one was truly 5 stars.\n\nOur 7pm Saturday night arrival was just perfect because we walked right in. 20 minutes later we were leaving and the line was out the door, although ice cream this good may be worth waiting in line for. \n\nIt would be hard to order anything besides the salted cookie dough flavor now that I\"ve tasted it, but I bet all their flavors are delicious. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Pittsburgh and hope that Millie finds her way to Chicago one day!"}

You think you'll just have something small, but then the flavors are all interesting, the samples satisfying and I end up with a homemade waffle cone and two flavors. Oh well, I can always practice self-control somewhere else. \n\nI absolutely love the Vietnamese Coffee, but then there is always another flavor that is interesting that I add because I have yet to try it. This past weekend I wanted to try the choc chip cookie dough. It was salted and such a great balance with their vanilla ice cream.  \n\nThere is also something about the music they have playing that just makes it a great time hanging out with your friends, no matter what time of year it is. Everyone leaves filling content, happy and ready to take on the world."}

It's quite a nice find as it is just outside Market Square which is more your typical bar and local scene and, thus, offers one of the few sweet options.\n\nI ordered 3 flavors in a cup: incline cherry, best chocolate, and Vietnamese coffee. The person serving me was not at all friendly and the staff, in general, did not seem overly friendly.\n\nAs for the ice cream, the Vietnamese coffee was amazing and probably the best coffee-flavored ice cream I've had. The best chocolate was not really that great, and the incline cherry was bad.\n\nIt's hard to not enjoy ice cream and by all means I did enjoy my treat even if it overall wasn't to die for (sans the Vietnamese coffee). Those who follow my reviews do however know that I carefully weigh attitude and demeanor of the staff. That said, while they were certainly not on their best and I could sense they really didn't want to be there, I'd give the place another try at minimum just for the Vietnamese coffee."}

There was a short line when we came on a hot summer night but it moved quickly. They list all the flavors on the board facing you as you stand in line so you have plenty of time to make a decision. They do give you samples if you ask for it! I tried the peanut butter and the mint, can't say I liked either of them. The peanut butter tasted a bit too salty and the mint was creamy, but a bit bland. I ended up ordering two small scoops of mint and coffee in a cone. Didn't want to hold up the line and try anymore. The coffee was way sweet and ended up being monotonous after the first few bites. I tried the rest of the fam's flavors and the mango gelato was pretty good. The blueberry sorbet was way tart but refreshing. The best thing about this place was the freshly made waffle cones! I liked the strong cinnamon and spices you can taste in the cone. They were crispy and on the thinner side so didn't feel like it was too much. But at $26 for 4 people, it's a bit steep for mediocre ice cream! I've had better - the flavors need to stand out and be a bit stronger! Plus for it being right next to Noodlehead though cause it makes a good dinner/dessert option!"}

Because I like Millie's, but sometimes when you look at that changing seasonal menu...there's just nothing there for you. \n\nOne coworker of mine in particular felt this way when they were hunting for ice cream on a hot day. They went to Millie's and found no standard flavors whatsoever - but they had things like olive oil ice cream on the menu instead. It's great to be creative and I really don't want to knock Millie's for trying new things. But, if you're going to try things like olive oil ice cream, can we just agree to make chocolate and vanilla available year-round? I think it would keep the menu balanced and accessible to all.\n\nAnyway - while I'm not avoiding Millie's like my coworker, I admit that they stopped being a go-to after the \"olive oil ice cream of the summer of 2019\" incident. But hey - when they're great, they're great! So I say check their flavors on their website to help plan your visit, and then enjoy."}

The beauty of it is you smell the freshly made waffle cones blocks away. So warm and inviting. The place is cute and clean. Seats are available inside and outside. The ladies selling the ice cream were always nice. Flavors keep changing and were always good. I like gelato more than ice cream. Since I had better gelato in my days (outside the US) I cannot give it five stars. My exotic favorites outside the US mainland are taro, toasted almonds, cactus fruit and whole milk/mastic gum pistachio gelatos.

When I moved to Pittsburgh, I knew I would have to make it to Millie's before the summer's end. Finally, on a Saturday night, I made it happen! There was a line out the door and the outdoor seating area was crowded, which really speaks to how much people love this place. \n\nWhen you walk in, the divine smell of homemade waffle cones hits you. I rarely order waffle cones, but had to try one after waiting in line and watching an employee make/roll the cones. I opted for the dairy-free mint chocolate chip ice cream and there was no disappointment to be had. I couldn't even tell that my ice cream was missing the dairy component! For those who go full dairy, the shop sells Lactaid for 50 cents, which is genius. \n\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed Millie's and will be back with more friends in tow.

I have to admit that Ms. Millie could teach Mr. Graeter about how to make a good cookie dough ice cream because this one was truly 5 stars.\n\nOur 7pm Saturday night arrival was just perfect because we walked right in. 20 minutes later we were leaving and the line was out the door, although ice cream this good may be worth waiting in line for. \n\nIt would be hard to order anything besides the salted cookie dough flavor now that I\"ve tasted it, but I bet all their flavors are delicious.

The peanut butter tasted a bit too salty and the mint was creamy, but a bit bland. I ended up ordering two small scoops of mint and coffee in a cone. Didn't want to hold up the line and try anymore. The coffee was way sweet and ended up being monotonous after the first few bites. I tried the rest of the fam's flavors and the mango gelato was pretty good.

The ladies selling the ice cream were always nice. Flavors keep changing and were always good. I like gelato more than ice cream. Since I had better gelato in my days (outside the US) I cannot give it five stars. My exotic favorites outside the US mainland are taro, toasted almonds, cactus fruit and whole milk/mastic gum pistachio gelatos. Millie's, here were some ideas for more flavors.. \n\nI still like this place a lot."}

The waffle cones are handmade and smell amazing when you walk in- for me the smell was almost a little overwhelming. \n\nI came in with my Fianc\u00e9 because we had just finished eating Thai food next door and wanted something sweet. I tried the mango, couldn't even finish my spoonful. I was expecting it to be more fruity and it tasted much more creamy and the mango was an after-thought. Tried the Viet Coffee flavor and wondered where the flavor was. My Fianc\u00e9 really liked their peanut butter flavor so he ended up getting that but I left without getting anything. They have maybe 10-12 flavors available and none of them sounded very appetizing to me after trying the first 2. \n\nHonestly have had better ice cream many other places. Maybe I'll have to go in when they have different flavors available."}

I rarely order waffle cones, but had to try one after waiting in line and watching an employee make/roll the cones. I opted for the dairy-free mint chocolate chip ice cream and there was no disappointment to be had. I couldn't even tell that my ice cream was missing the dairy component! For those who go full dairy, the shop sells Lactaid for 50 cents, which is genius. \n\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed Millie's and will be back with more friends in tow. Thanks for supplying Pittsburgh with such delicious ice cream!"}

I have to admit that Ms. Millie could teach Mr. Graeter about how to make a good cookie dough ice cream because this one was truly 5 stars.\n\nOur 7pm Saturday night arrival was just perfect because we walked right in. 20 minutes later we were leaving and the line was out the door, although ice cream this good may be worth waiting in line for. \n\nIt would be hard to order anything besides the salted cookie dough flavor now that I\"ve tasted it, but I bet all their flavors are delicious.

This past weekend I wanted to try the choc chip cookie dough.

They do give you samples if you ask for it! I tried the peanut butter and the mint, can't say I liked either of them. The peanut butter tasted a bit too salty and the mint was creamy, but a bit bland. I ended up ordering two small scoops of mint and coffee in a cone. Didn't want to hold up the line and try anymore. The coffee was way sweet and ended up being monotonous after the first few bites. I tried the rest of the fam's flavors and the mango gelato was pretty good. The blueberry sorbet was way tart but refreshing. The best thing about this place was the freshly made waffle cones! I liked the strong cinnamon and spices you can taste in the cone. They were crispy and on the thinner side so didn't feel like it was too much. But at $26 for 4 people, it's a bit steep for mediocre ice cream!

I lived in Pittsburgh for one year and on the top of the list of places that left a good memory is this one (and Espresso A Mano). I think it's one of the best ice cream places I have been in the US. The beauty of it is you smell the freshly made waffle cones blocks away. So warm and inviting. The place is cute and clean. Seats are available inside and outside. The ladies selling the ice cream were always nice. Flavors keep changing and were always good. I like gelato more than ice cream. Since I had better gelato in my days (outside the US) I cannot give it five stars. My exotic favorites outside the US mainland are taro, toasted almonds, cactus fruit and whole milk/mastic gum pistachio gelatos.

Because I like Millie's, but sometimes when you look at that changing seasonal menu...there's just nothing there for you. \n\nOne coworker of mine in particular felt this way when they were hunting for ice cream on a hot day. They went to Millie's and found no standard flavors whatsoever - but they had things like olive oil ice cream on the menu instead. It's great to be creative and I really don't want to knock Millie's for trying new things. But, if you're going to try things like olive oil ice cream, can we just agree to make chocolate and vanilla available year-round? I think it would keep the menu balanced and accessible to all.\n\nAnyway - while I'm not avoiding Millie's like my coworker, I admit that they stopped being a go-to after the \"olive oil ice cream of the summer of 2019\" incident. But hey - when they're great, they're great! So I say check their flavors on their website to help plan your visit, and then enjoy."}

Because I like Millie's, but sometimes when you look at that changing seasonal menu...there's just nothing there for you. \n\nOne coworker of mine in particular felt this way when they were hunting for ice cream on a hot day. They went to Millie's and found no standard flavors whatsoever - but they had things like olive oil ice cream on the menu instead. It's great to be creative and I really don't want to knock Millie's for trying new things. But, if you're going to try things like olive oil ice cream, can we just agree to make chocolate and vanilla available year-round? I think it would keep the menu balanced and accessible to all.\n\nAnyway - while I'm not avoiding Millie's like my coworker, I admit that they stopped being a go-to after the \"olive oil ice cream of the summer of 2019\" incident. But hey - when they're great, they're great! So I say check their flavors on their website to help plan your visit, and then enjoy."}

I lived in Pittsburgh for one year and on the top of the list of places that left a good memory is this one (and Espresso A Mano). I think it's one of the best ice cream places I have been in the US. The beauty of it is you smell the freshly made waffle cones blocks away. So warm and inviting. The place is cute and clean. Seats are available inside and outside. The ladies selling the ice cream were always nice. Flavors keep changing and were always good. I like gelato more than ice cream. Since I had better gelato in my days (outside the US) I cannot give it five stars. My exotic favorites outside the US mainland are taro, toasted almonds, cactus fruit and whole milk/mastic gum pistachio gelatos.

Maybe I'll have to go in when they have different flavors available."}

As a bonus, this location even makes vegan shakes and serves gluten-free cones, which I'm sure is a big factor in their popularity. \n\nAll of that said, if I could give this review a 3.5 rating to be more fair in my assessment, I would. Because I like Millie's, but sometimes when you look at that changing seasonal menu...there's just nothing there for you. \n\nOne coworker of mine in particular felt this way when they were hunting for ice cream on a hot day. They went to Millie's and found no standard flavors whatsoever - but they had things like olive oil ice cream on the menu instead. It's great to be creative and I really don't want to knock Millie's for trying new things. But, if you're going to try things like olive oil ice cream, can we just agree to make chocolate and vanilla available year-round? I think it would keep the menu balanced and accessible to all.\n\nAnyway - while I'm not avoiding Millie's like my coworker, I admit that they stopped being a go-to after the \"olive oil ice cream of the summer of 2019\" incident. But hey - when they're great, they're great! So I say check their flavors on their website to help plan your visit, and then enjoy."}

I lived in Pittsburgh for one year and on the top of the list of places that left a good memory is this one (and Espresso A Mano). I think it's one of the best ice cream places I have been in the US. The beauty of it is you smell the freshly made waffle cones blocks away. So warm and inviting. The place is cute and clean. Seats are available inside and outside. The ladies selling the ice cream were always nice. Flavors keep changing and were always good. I like gelato more than ice cream. Since I had better gelato in my days (outside the US) I cannot give it five stars. My exotic favorites outside the US mainland are taro, toasted almonds, cactus fruit and whole milk/mastic gum pistachio gelatos.

So it's easy to pop in for dessert after a meal. Or to pop in just because!\n\nThey're known and loved for being a local, seasonal, all natural ice cream and sorbet maker.

As a bonus, this location even makes vegan shakes and serves gluten-free cones, which I'm sure is a big factor in their popularity. \n\nAll of that said, if I could give this review a 3.5 rating to be more fair in my assessment, I would. Because I like Millie's, but sometimes when you look at that changing seasonal menu...there's just nothing there for you. \n\nOne coworker of mine in particular felt this way when they were hunting for ice cream on a hot day. They went to Millie's and found no standard flavors whatsoever - but they had things like olive oil ice cream on the menu instead. It's great to be creative and I really don't want to knock Millie's for trying new things. But, if you're going to try things like olive oil ice cream, can we just agree to make chocolate and vanilla available year-round? I think it would keep the menu balanced and accessible to all.\n\nAnyway - while I'm not avoiding Millie's like my coworker, I admit that they stopped being a go-to after the \"olive oil ice cream of the summer of 2019\" incident. But hey - when they're great, they're great! So I say check their flavors on their website to help plan your visit, and then enjoy."}

To prevent melted ice cream from dripping out of the bottom of the cone they place a mini marshmallow before scooping the ice cream.\n\nThe shop itself is really nice with indoor and outdoor seating, both out front and in the back.

So it's easy to pop in for dessert after a meal. Or to pop in just because!\n\nThey're known and loved for being a local, seasonal, all natural ice cream and sorbet maker. They serve ice cream scoops and pints alike, plus milkshakes. As a bonus, this location even makes vegan shakes and serves gluten-free cones, which I'm sure is a big factor in their popularity. \n\nAll of that said, if I could give this review a 3.5 rating to be more fair in my assessment, I would. Because I like Millie's, but sometimes when you look at that changing seasonal menu...there's just nothing there for you. \n\nOne coworker of mine in particular felt this way when they were hunting for ice cream on a hot day. They went to Millie's and found no standard flavors whatsoever - but they had things like olive oil ice cream on the menu instead. It's great to be creative and I really don't want to knock Millie's for trying new things. But, if you're going to try things like olive oil ice cream, can we just agree to make chocolate and vanilla available year-round? I think it would keep the menu balanced and accessible to all.\n\nAnyway - while I'm not avoiding Millie's like my coworker, I admit that they stopped being a go-to after the \"olive oil ice cream of the summer of 2019\" incident. But hey - when they're great, they're great! So I say check their flavors on their website to help plan your visit, and then enjoy."}

There was a short line when we came on a hot summer night but it moved quickly. They list all the flavors on the board facing you as you stand in line so you have plenty of time to make a decision. They do give you samples if you ask for it! I tried the peanut butter and the mint, can't say I liked either of them. The peanut butter tasted a bit too salty and the mint was creamy, but a bit bland. I ended up ordering two small scoops of mint and coffee in a cone. Didn't want to hold up the line and try anymore. The coffee was way sweet and ended up being monotonous after the first few bites. I tried the rest of the fam's flavors and the mango gelato was pretty good. The blueberry sorbet was way tart but refreshing. The best thing about this place was the freshly made waffle cones! I liked the strong cinnamon and spices you can taste in the cone. They were crispy and on the thinner side so didn't feel like it was too much. But at $26 for 4 people, it's a bit steep for mediocre ice cream!

They do give you samples if you ask for it! I tried the peanut butter and the mint, can't say I liked either of them. The peanut butter tasted a bit too salty and the mint was creamy, but a bit bland. I ended up ordering two small scoops of mint and coffee in a cone. Didn't want to hold up the line and try anymore. The coffee was way sweet and ended up being monotonous after the first few bites. I tried the rest of the fam's flavors and the mango gelato was pretty good. The blueberry sorbet was way tart but refreshing. The best thing about this place was the freshly made waffle cones! I liked the strong cinnamon and spices you can taste in the cone. They were crispy and on the thinner side so didn't feel like it was too much. But at $26 for 4 people, it's a bit steep for mediocre ice cream! I've had better - the flavors need to stand out and be a bit stronger! Plus for it being right next to Noodlehead though cause it makes a good dinner/dessert option!"}

Because I like Millie's, but sometimes when you look at that changing seasonal menu...there's just nothing there for you. \n\nOne coworker of mine in particular felt this way when they were hunting for ice cream on a hot day. They went to Millie's and found no standard flavors whatsoever - but they had things like olive oil ice cream on the menu instead. It's great to be creative and I really don't want to knock Millie's for trying new things. But, if you're going to try things like olive oil ice cream, can we just agree to make chocolate and vanilla available year-round? I think it would keep the menu balanced and accessible to all.\n\nAnyway - while I'm not avoiding Millie's like my coworker, I admit that they stopped being a go-to after the \"olive oil ice cream of the summer of 2019\" incident.

I'm all about the classics, so I got a scoop of vanilla in a dish with rainbow sprinkles. My date got...something vegan? With all sorts of peanut things and sauce. We were both very happy with our choices, and will definitely be back!"}

It's quite a nice find as it is just outside Market Square which is more your typical bar and local scene and, thus, offers one of the few sweet options.\n\nI ordered 3 flavors in a cup: incline cherry, best chocolate, and Vietnamese coffee. The person serving me was not at all friendly and the staff, in general, did not seem overly friendly.\n\nAs for the ice cream, the Vietnamese coffee was amazing and probably the best coffee-flavored ice cream I've had. The best chocolate was not really that great, and the incline cherry was bad.\n\nIt's hard to not enjoy ice cream and by all means I did enjoy my treat even if it overall wasn't to die for (sans the Vietnamese coffee). Those who follow my reviews do however know that I carefully weigh attitude and demeanor of the staff. That said, while they were certainly not on their best and I could sense they really didn't want to be there, I'd give the place another try at minimum just for the Vietnamese coffee."}

There was a short line when we came on a hot summer night but it moved quickly. They list all the flavors on the board facing you as you stand in line so you have plenty of time to make a decision. They do give you samples if you ask for it! I tried the peanut butter and the mint, can't say I liked either of them. The peanut butter tasted a bit too salty and the mint was creamy, but a bit bland. I ended up ordering two small scoops of mint and coffee in a cone. Didn't want to hold up the line and try anymore. The coffee was way sweet and ended up being monotonous after the first few bites. I tried the rest of the fam's flavors and the mango gelato was pretty good. The blueberry sorbet was way tart but refreshing. The best thing about this place was the freshly made waffle cones! I liked the strong cinnamon and spices you can taste in the cone. They were crispy and on the thinner side so didn't feel like it was too much. But at $26 for 4 people, it's a bit steep for mediocre ice cream! I've had better - the flavors need to stand out and be a bit stronger! Plus for it being right next to Noodlehead though cause it makes a good dinner/dessert option!"}

I love the fact that their ice cream is homemade (aka free of harsh chemical preservatives). The ice cream itself is always super fresh and delicious- this time around I tried out the cookie dough, which was AMAZING (as anticipated). I'm also obsessed with their homemade waffle cones!! They have a unique flavor due to the added cinnamon and nutmeg. To prevent melted ice cream from dripping out of the bottom of the cone they place a mini marshmallow before scooping the ice cream.\n\nThe shop itself is really nice with indoor and outdoor seating, both out front and in the back. They also have complimentary water and cups at the self service bar equipped with napkins, spoons, etc. \n\nNow go indulge with some Millie's ice cream!!"}

When you walk into the shop, your hit with the smell of the fresh cinnamon sugar waffle cones and you just want to bottle it up!  They have seasonal flavors they rotate tho, and for this fall my favs are London Fog and Apple Cider Donut!  Their vegan dark chocolate is the richest chocolate ice cream I've ever had and I love every bite of it!"}

Their fresh, homemade ice cream is incomparable to anything else I've had in the city. I love that their flavors change daily and they typically are always featuring seasonal options. \n\nThere's some seating inside but it gets full! Outside seating is also available. Check it out ASAP!! (It's always ice cream season, after all.)"}

As soon as you walk in you're immersed into the smell of fresh waffle cones. The atmosphere is bright as light reflex off the white walls which always pours me in a cheery mood. \n\nThe ice cream itself is delectable. Sweet but not overpowering with different/ new flavors all the time. My current favorite/ what's pictured below is the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. Millie's is pretty gracious with their cookie dough pieces. I typically get one scoop because of my semi diet up I couple eat 2 or 3 scoops in a sitting. \n\nI would also recommend as a post dinner dessert place(especially in the summer when you can sit outside on the benches)"}
