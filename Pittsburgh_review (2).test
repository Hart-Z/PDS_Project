"5.0","The service is always great here. I come here for lunch sometimes since I work right near the strip. The service is fast and the seafood always tastes fresh."
"4.0","We had really delicious food:Xiao Long Bao, Gyokza and Kongolian Steak Stir Fry... and it was ALL really great.The restaurant Atmosphere was fun with lights and a japanese mural...Our only qualm was that it got really busy and our waitress forgot to close us out. The bartender helped instead. I definitely recommend those Xiao long bao!!"
"4.0","Finally got the chance to explore the menu at Cinderlands, after visiting their bar several times. Cinderlands always has some great beers on tap, and they've been taking the Pittsburgh craft beer scene by storm, in an impressively short period of time. They always have delicious craft cocktails on the menu as well.The ambiance at Cinderlands is great! The decor is clean and kind of cozy-industrial. When the weather is warm, you're able to sit at the double-sided open window at the storefront. I've been wanting to try their fried chicken sandwich for weeks, and I finally got the chance. It was a bit spicy for me, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. My boyfriend was excited to stop by on a Wednesday for their SSBC (super secret burger club). This weeks burger offering was a triple decker burger with jalapeños, marinara, and mozzarella. It was fantastic, but a bit pricey at $18. I'm always impressed by Cinderlands, especially the gourmet food they're able to crank out of their tiny kitchen. I'm super pumped for their new warehouse location to open!"
"1.0","This place is a sh*tshow.A customer wandered off mid-order, and one of the two idiots working the line decided that the appropriate response was a hard-target search of every gas station, residence, warehouse, farmhouse, henhouse, outhouse and doghouse in the area.   Those of us in line didn't mind the wait at all, because 'lunch hour' is a misnomer and we actually all have unlimited time.  You can only imagine how relieved we were when the errant customer was finally located (upstairs!) and able to tell him what kind of rice she wanted.The register was operated by a tyrannosaurus rex disguised as a young woman.  At least, I assume it was a tyrannosaurus rex, based on the fact that she seemed unable to extend her arms away from her body to accept payment or hand me a receipt, and she only spoke in grunts.  A real charmer.  This place doesn't have a hiring problem at all.The burrito was typical Chipotle: Poorly wrapped, falling apart, and loaded with sueños rotos.   I'll definitely be walking past this place again, on my way somewhere else for lunch."
"5.0","Best breakfast sandwiches in the city.The staff are nice and attentive.  The sugar loaded smoothies taste great.The space itself is also very cool.  I like the artwork.Prices are acceptable for what you get.  Fresh made food is really nice."
"5.0","Always wonderful!The service is spectacular. Every time. The steak is, of course, spectacular. There is nothing in this world that is more delicious that their Kona Crusted steak. Seriously. It is the best place to eat in Pittsburgh. Always top shelf."
"5.0","Great hand crafted tacos using fresh, local ingredients? Sí! (SNL Stefan voice while covering nose and mouth) This place has everything...pork, beef, chicken, vegan, pop in glass bottles and fancy, churched up black beans. Friendly service, fun atmosphere (although small) and window seats for watching the fabulous ebb and flow that is Carson street foot traffic. When it comes to tortillas you have two options, flour or corn. My advice is corn...you won't be disappointed. I went for lunch yesterday and ordered the bbq chicken special , the pork and a bottle of Pepsi. Total damage was $8. Great lunch spot, and word is that they are open until 3am on Fri and Sat for those saturated folks leaving the bars and not too keen on pizza."
"3.0","Hubby insisted on checking this place out and it turned out to be a disappointment. I didn't like the fish sandwich nor the oysters.3 stars for all the history behind this little space."
"1.0","Just witnessed the manager let a co-workers kids run around screaming, turning on and off the light all the while the mom screamed at them. Felt like day- care. Very disappointing"
"3.0","Great dive atmosphere, but not dive prices.  Not necessarily GROSSLY overpriced, but just enough that it doesn't make sense.  $7.00 for a craft beer in a dive?  C'mon."
"2.0","I was walking downtown on an anomaly of a beautiful winter night in Pittsburgh. I just got in from Los Angeles and I was looking for something light and healthy to eat. I was enjoying the process of walking around and looking at all of the options and variety in Market Square, when I happened upon Hello Bistro. From the outside I could already tell it had healthy options that I would be interested in. It also looked pretty busy on the inside so I always take that as a good sign. I waited in line for a little bit as there was a few people in front of me, that  gave me a chance to read through the menu and make my choice. I decided to build my own salad. Once I got to the register, it appeared that the cashier had something else to do so I waited at the register for a while. When she got back, she took my order and I paid. Yet, nobody ever made my salad. I waited for about 20 minutes and she apologized and said 'it was busy.' I finally got my salad about a half hour later to go. I chose mixed greens and salmon with vegetables, crunchies, and a squeezed lemon and apple cider vinaigrette dressing. It was delicious but there was so much lettuce I could barely taste the good stuff. Maybe that's how some people prefer their salad, I would rather have a small bed of lettuce and a lot of veggies and meat. The next morning, I was craving a breakfast sandwich and I was working at Point Park University. Hello Bistro is right down the street, I went and got their California breakfast sandwich. I was the only one in there, they had just opened and the girl was just prepping the food. It's took me about 10 minutes in total. There's also a restroom there that you need the code for. The prices are very reasonable. I paid $13 for my salad because I had to pay extra for salmon and avocado, and my breakfast sandwich was only six dollars. I live in Los Angeles so these prices seemed extremely reasonable to me. They do have indoor seating, but most people were getting theirs to go. The breakfast sandwich was way better than the salad, however I still probably won't return, I would take it or leave it! It is an easy solution and quick fix if you're in a hurry."
"3.0","This place is a esthetically pleasing. I didn't try the food because everything was so unexpected. It's not bad unexpected but when veggies are on the happy hour menu I was all, 'Maybe some wings would be good.' Their beer selection was good as the cocktail menu is intimidating. Intimidating is the perfect word to describe the menus here. If I have to Google most of the ingredients it's a solid, no for me. It's a perfect event space with nice customer service and a parking structure a block away. I'd come back and bring a vegan."
"5.0","Good place. I like the bbq skewer stuff. The sushi is good too as well as the deserts."
"4.0","Cheap. Get the teriyaki chicken on the lunch menu, but get it spicy. It's decent.Like the new sushi bar. Decent chinese if you're around CMU and need a cheap lunch"
"1.0","The worst pizza I have ever had in Pittsburgh. Crust was doughy, cheese tasted horrible, and the sauce was so minimal it was basically non existent. I'm actually impressed on how they managed to make a pizza taste so bad. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. You'd be better off getting a pizza from literally anywhere else in the city of Pittsburgh."
"2.0","Pathetic example of a taco truck. For 21 dollars I got four tacos, two shrimp and two beef. First off, way over priced for the little food you get. The tacos were dripping grease and had little flavor to the beef. The toppings were minimal at most and you enjoyed maybe one bite with the toppings if you were lucky. No hot sauce to add to tacos. Just a pathetic display of a taco truck. I wouldn't mind spending over five dollars a taco if they were actually good and worth it.  These were not. Would not get again and can't compare to any other tacos in Pittsburgh."
"1.0","The waitress served us today is really rude and mean. The whole dining experience is disgusting"
"3.0","This place is deceptively small from the outside. It's very large and spacious- the whole place is one big room. They had nice big horseshoe booths to sit at which was great for our group. Pretty reasonable in cost as well. The beer menu and drink menu was expansive, you shouldn't have trouble finding something you like or want to try; there is literally a drink for everyone! I liked the food menu as well. I could have gotten a number of things and probably been really happy. I settled on the fish tacos. Delicious! Warning: they do have a kick to them so if you are intolerant of spicy food then I'd check out on if the other choices. Waiter was attentive and chatty. The inky thing I didn't like was that he stood at the table and watched us tip him and he asked how much change I wanted back.  I'm a good tipper but I like my privacy when tipping hahaha"
"4.0","Two words, Yellow Curry! So super tasty and fabulous! I"
"1.0","$7 for an IPA on tap. $6.50 for a cider. $4 for flavorless tortilla chips, salsa that wasn't much more than tomatoes and onion, and queso that was an unidentifiable mix of cheese and whatever else was lying around. $20 for bland 'nachos' and expensive drinks...we will never go back. Awful!"
"4.0","Really enjoyed my time here! They have plenty of options that accommodate a variety of diets. The wifi is fast and it is a great place to stay and do work. I came with a group of girls and was comfortable staying here all day with yummy snacks every few hours. While my friend who comes here more often says that the staff is typically great, today was another story. There was one guy behind the counter who was truly rude...He looked at me with absolute disdain. He answered my friendly questions as short as he possibly could. The only effort he put into our interaction was his determination to be as unhelpful as possible. To give you an idea, we were both so uncomfortable that my friend actually had to walk away and laugh. Later on, both the men's and women's bathroom ran out of toilet paper. My friend let him know, and he told the girls to use napkins. He didn't even check to see if there was more toilet paper in stock. I'm sure there was. This man. I don't say any of this to advise you not to come! We had a great time otherwise and honestly this provided some laughs. Writing this review was in part necessary to shed the severe discomfort of that situation and in part to let other Delanie customers know that they are not alone. Let your voices be heard! You deserve toilet paper. You deserve to know 'how do you make your smoothies.' Don't let anyone make you feel otherwise!"
"4.0","I came here around 9pm on a Friday night. The entrance was somewhat hidden and you take a lot of stairs to get up to the actual restaurant. We did not have a reservation, but with only 2 people they found us a table within minutes. They don't have very much seating, so I would recommend getting a reservation.To be honest, I typically lean more toward eating sushi rolls, than traditional sushi. So I wasn't sure what I'd like, I started with a scallop hand roll, which was very good. Our waiter also suggested that we share the Sashimi Plate to get a taste for a variety of sushi... salmon, tuna, yellowtail, fluke, octopus, and striped bass. It was good.It's a unique place."
"4.0","Love the atmosphere here. Having dinner and drinks by the river on a nice night can't be beat. They have a nice choice of beers to choose from and many options  on the food menu."
"4.0","This isn't New York pizza, but it gets a 4-star rating for still being delicious and being one of the best, delicious, and cheapest pizza places in Pittsburgh. A large pizza is only $6 on weekend nights after a certain time (I think 8PM). Plus, their ranch sauce is heavenly. I usually came during late 1-2am weekend nights while seeking a meal after a night out. There aren't many options for late night eateries in Oakland, but this was the spot. The line would usually be long, but it moved very quickly. I usually asked for pepperoni on my pizza which would take longer, but it was worth the wait! But the plain cheese was great as well. The pizza is greasy, but I would consider it the perfect amount of grease that I would want on a pizza. My favorite thing about Sorrento's pizza is that the cheese is extremely 'melty' and oozes as you eat it. I have been here on non-weekend nights as well and got pizza and it had the same great taste. I have never tried any of the other menu items, but it seems like they have great lunch deals!"
"3.0","This is a review for the takeout experience. I have always had generally positive dining experiences here, with the food being very good. They are super slow, however, so if you are trying to get out in a reasonable amount of time, do go elsewhere.I was told that my takeout order would be ready in 30 minutes, but when I arrived at 30 they told me another 15 minutes. I found this to be unacceptable, and it appeared to me that there were several others who were also in the same situation. They need to get their act together with regards to seating and timely take-out orders."
"3.0","Came here for karaoke a few times. It's a dive bar with a bit of an older crowd, but there are some solid singers out there! My group of friends managed to sing a song or 2, but had to wait around for a while before we had the chance. The place gets really crowded and you have to get there early (or get lucky) in order to get a seat. Pushing your way up to the bar can be kind of crazy. Drinks are reasonably priced and pretty much what you expect in Shadyside."
"5.0","Such a great new ALL VEGAN restaurant in Pittsburgh. I love this place because it has what I would call 'junk' vegan food as well as your classic vegan bowls. Do keep in mind for raw vegans they don't have any options here but they did have a lot of gluten free options! Bring cash, CASH ONLY here. One last things it's byob so bring a bottle of wine and enjoy!"
"4.0","If this place could be described in four words, they would be:Angry, Sweaty, Dive-y, and DELICIOUSThis place is a Pittsburgh classic. Don't go here if your looking for some hip and trendy seafood joint. I'm pretty sure the decor hasn't changed in the past 50 years, but that's part of what makes it awesome.The cashiers and cooks are angry, and slightly scary looking, but not in a bad way (if that makes any sense whatsoever). Their no-nonsense, 'soup-nazi' style fits with the classic blue-collar Pittsburgh motif this place is still holding on to. If you go in knowing what you want, you'll be fine.Bottom line, and most importantly, the food. Pretty much everything is fried, but it's all good. Never too greasy, and only lightly breaded. When lent rolls around, you always see every restaurant in town with signs boasting, 'Voted Best Fish in Town.' I'm not sure who's voting, and how EVERY restaurant seems to have the best. Don't be fooled, Oyster House IS the best fried fish in town."
"4.0","Have been here 3-4 times and it never disappoints. I always usually go with the special or whatever the staff recommends that night, which has traditionally been steak. I have had a couple really well cooked steaks from The Capital Grille. The prices are expensive and you can pretty much assume that you will be paying $100/person easy after drinks and an appetizer or desert. It is however very very good. If you are in town do your self a favor and go grab a steak here."
"5.0","Love this place! Everything is good! Cajun fries is a must have! The only thing is they are cash only which is inconvenient. Didn't know that when I went there for the first time. But the stuff were very helpful and friendly. Highly recommend to anyone who loves cheese steak, who wants comfort food! Really can't go wrong here."
"4.0","A great Korean style fried chicken! Super crispy on the outside and moist inside. You can choose from two sauces, three different sizes I believe with different combination of wings and drumsticks. And very good bubble tea as well. The reason i am giving it four start is they only have two sauces to chose from and no dry fried wings neither. I hope they can bring more flavors to the menu!"
"4.0","***** Snacks*** Ramen**** Setting+1* for the nitamago (6 min egg) and crispy chicken skin--------Small little diner/bar that is perhaps slightly overrated at the point.  Love the atmosphere. Best for 2 ppl (Friday night, 2 was a walk-in. 4 was a 25 min wait and 6 was even longer.)Snacks were fantastic. Grilled Miso Eggplant is a cold appetizer. Fresh and light.  Fried cauliflower is a hot appetizer.  The sauce seems to have peanut butter, so watch out if you are allergic to nuts.  But it was really good and should try. Ramen was so-so. My Inferno Ramen was hot and salty., and that was it.  I wish the broth can stand out a bit, and less salty. The spiciness was good but with no dimension to it.  Extra point for Nitamago (6 min egg) and crispy chicken skin.  Egg was done to perfection and texture of crispy chicken skin was great.  But they dont bring taste to the ramen.  so it's lacking a bit. Room for improvement.  Might give it a second chance later."
"4.0","This place has very good food.  The waiter Matthew was very attentive. The Lobster Roll was good, the tenderloin sliders very tender, great soup, yummy housemade great fruit soda.  20 bucks is the minimum.  I forgot to take pictures of the food.  My bad."
"5.0","Service was key, ppl were friendly, meal was delicious.  Not for the faint of heart as the dishes are off the wall.... maybe hit or miss to some less adventurous diners but to me.... totally satisfying.  I had an egg dish with lots of goodies involved.. can't remember what but.... combined with a bit of warm sake, the jigae warmed the gut.  I'd go back."
"4.0","I haven't had Pho since I moved to Pittsburgh, partly due to the lack of ethnically diverse cuisines here. But I must say that this place does a good job in bringing one of my favorite comfort foods.Although the broth isn't super rich and deep, it still has lots of flavor. In fact, I like how light the broth is and how it isn't heavy. I had the Shrimp Pho, which was delicious; the shrimps were also tender and not overcooked. The serving size was pretty big too, so you get your bucks' worth. Bean sprouts, Thai basil, onions, and lime wedges are served alongside as add-ins when you order soup based dishes (Cilantro is already added to the soup). However, I noticed that these garnishes were a bit limp and dry, not fresh.The spring rolls were a nice start, but I would say that it's a bit dry. If you're sensitive to cilantro, do not order it, because it comes with a good amount inside. Also, this place is CASH ONLY, so come prepared."
"5.0","I took way too long to try Peppi's! I went with the regular Italian and asked for it hot. The bread, as most have noted, was delicious! Good quality meats, provolone, lettuce/tomato/onion and Italian dressing were perfectly embedded in the soft, incredibly fresh hoagie roll. I was afraid this was going to be another Primanti's, but it's not! I am a fan!"
"4.0","Went here for the first time today with my family since we have heard that it's a Pittsburgh staple. We didn't know what to expect and we knew ahead of time that it's cash only which is no big deal since there's an ATM right around the corner from the restaurant and up and down the street basically.We didn't wait to long, their waiting room/hostess could be a little more welcoming though.The space looks crowded and you're a bit overwhelmed when you first walk in but when you sit down you realize that the tables are actually spread apart enough that you don't feel too crowded. Each table has enough distance that you feel comfortable and you can talk with the people at your table.The waitress was nice and we got our food very quickly.  So the service was fast and attentive.  And the food was delicious! We got the Morning after Breakfast Special and it was so good. We all ate everything off our plates. I would've ordered another side of the Lyonnaise potatoes if I wasn't so full from all the yummy food.The only beef I have about the restaurant was that the waitress basically put the check on our table without telling us.  We found it under one of our glasses on the table.  She never announced it and also she never showed up at our table after that. And that was right at the beginning of our meal.  My family wanted more coffee and drinks but she never showed up.  All in all, the food is great, I definitely recommend going there.  But the service could be a little better. I felt like we got there, got our food and then they wanted us out asap."
"5.0","We first tried Onion Maiden at the spring Veg Fest last year, and we're so excited that they now have their own permanent home in Pittsburgh. The staff was so pleasant and attentive; the restaurant was very clean (love the gender neutral bathrooms). The food was amazing; it was almost too hard to decide what to get!  The house made sodas and teas were wonderful too. We got the Monster Mash appetizer, my husband got his favorite - the Trooper Dawg, and i got the tater tot nachos - because that had to be about the best idea ever. Also, take home some desserts because they're to die for! Love that Pittsburgh is becoming more vegan friendly."
"5.0","Hard to believe we hadn't been here in three years. Sad for them to have had the fire but the place looks amazing. The tasting menu was fabulous and a real bargain considering the quantity and quality. I could eat that cider braised chicken and the octopus and the mushrooms every day. It's crowded and it's loud and the staff is nonetheless impeccable at every turn."
"4.0","I went for lunch here on a holiday. It was a little too busy for the amount of staff they had but not too bad. I tried the feijoada, which is a black bean and carrots stew with chicken. It was hearty and flavorful, with a generous chunk of bread a lot like French bread--crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. I had a cup of regular coffee, which I thought was really quite good. This is a nice change from everyday food."
"3.0","My sister-in-law and i stopped in late night for some pizza and wings. I had never been here before but knew it would be open so we the 5 minute drive here. The menu offers a large list of things.. including deep dish pizza.We ordered a regular pizza and plain wings. The wings were delicious.. crispy and by no means a wing ding. Pizza was average but eh whatever. We were all starving.The guy taking our order was a total sweetie. We enjoyed a beer while waiting for the food. A cool thing about Gennaro's is that they sell (& DELIVER!) beer. You can mix & match six packs or buy them individually (not sure if that option is avail for delivery) Next time i will pass on the pizza and try some thing else"
"3.0","Summary: friendly neighborhood Peruvian eatery + gift shop. La Feria occupies the floor above the Pamela's in Shadyside. It does not have a large foot-print, and half of it was devoted to the souvenirs.  This leaves little space for the dining venture. The restaurant offers only a small menu, but the price is reasonable and the portion generous. For what you pay, the food tastes pretty good too. I do sort of wish that my empanadas were fresh out of an oven rather than a microwave.3.5 stars"
"5.0","Total Awesomeness!!! Best tacos I've ever had. From the second you walk in the door the authentic aromas and décor draw you closer, the friendly and engaging staff draw you closer and then the food...oh the food!!! If one passes this place up for a burger or some other quick meal they would truly be missing out on a little piece of heaven in a shell!"
"3.0","I used to love this place, it is truly one of Pittsburgh's jewels.  I always found their food to be good up until my last two visits.  The last two times I was left with really bad stomach cramps the next day or two after eating there.  This makes me really sad because when I had the food before it was amazing.  The service is always great and the pricing is perfect for the amount of food you get.  I do not know if the issue is just with me and my stomach but sadly I think I have to lay off this place for awhile."
"4.0","We came in on a Friday and there was a good crowd. The hostess had stepped away so we waited a bit to be seated. All was taken care of and we sat down. The menu offers an interesting take on burgers, but we would have liked a bit more detail, e.g. what's the #theblend (meat and mushroom patty as our waitress answered when we inquired).I ordered the Fox Chapel, which has #theblend as well as goat cheese, with balsamic. Hubs ordered the Mexican War. Our burgers were flavorful. As someone who doesn't crave meat, the mushroom mix was appreciated. The Mexican War had chillies in the patty, which offered a nice kick. The food was a decent size and I'm a fan of places that offer side salads in lieu of fries as a no charge option. The buns are very basic potato buns. I'd recommend the restaurant being more adventurous with that. The draft list has a good bit of options. Hubs got the ESB--fine option for the price. I got the Millennial Marmalade. It was sweeter than I'd like, but should have gathered by its name."
"3.0","Cool ambiance and an open kitchen, but calling this a sushi place is a bit of a misnomer in my opinion. They only offer rudimentary nigiri/sashami at fairly high prices. The cooked selections - like the octopus balls are quite good and more resoanbly priced. Drinlk list not bad, but somewhat weak/small for my tastes. Overall this is far more of a $$$ than a $$ place IMHO.The reason for 3 versus 4 stars is the level of service - while our server was friendly, we went 20 minutes waiting for  our first drink order. The food came out in a rush, then another long wait to order second round. when it gets to the point that i'm annoyed, its worth mentioning. I can't lay this at the establishments feet, but i found the clientele offputting somewhat. Neither my son nor i felt comfortable - and i'm the gregarious sort. Just not our kind of crowd i guess - not really hipster, but a vibe i can't put my finger on."
"5.0","One of the best Italian restaurants I have been to in Pittsburgh. Their gorgonzola basil sauce is to die for and their cannoli are out of this world. They have fresh, soft, delicious, bread and are very good at replenishing the bread basket and water. In addition to the excellent food the service is wonderful! The owners and all the staff are very kind and gave our whole table dessert on the house. Their restaurant is homey yet intimate and I look forward to returning for another tasty meal."
"4.0","Loved this Bigham find! Perfect if you are looking to grab a little breakfast or lunch and a coffee. We had the turkey/egg whites/provolone on wheat and were happy with it! Also had the banana nut chai. We stopped in on a Sunday around 11:30 and a line quickly formed after we had walked in. I think this is a regular stop for people who live in the area. Easy parking in front on the street. I would definitely pop in again if I'm on Mount Washington."
"4.0","I feel like I should write a review since I've been here 4-5 times since it opened a month ago hehe. I've always been a fan of Hello Bistro since first going to the Oakland location when I lived there. Bobby fell in love with their salads and i dig the super burger and fries (& salads, but i'm more of a french fry person lol) I actually remember writing in my review for the Oakland location 'it'd be awesome if they put a HB downtown'. It's like I have a magic genie or something :OThe reason I waited a little for the review is because the first 2 weeks the wait time was a little long due to just opening and everyone checking it out. I didnt want to put in review that I waited forever for my food because I knew eventually it would be fine. But now even when it's busy, the wait time to get your food is not long at all.. so that's a plus.They have specials here that I dont remember seeing at the other locations (forgive me if i'm wrong on that fact) You can get a grilled cheese, soup & drink for $6.99 or a super burger, fries & drink for $7.99. The grilled cheese was tasty and i've had it both with their tomato and chicken noodle soup. I felt the chicken noodle soup was really lacking chicken but eh what can ya do. The grilled cheese was fine and it helped my tummy a week after being sick and my appetite not getting back to normal asap. I havent had a salad from this location, but every other location I experienced a great salad.I'm so thankful and excited this is downtown since I spend 40+ hours a week here. I love the build your own salad idea and they have a lengthy list of choices to put on your salad. Check it out if you've never experienced Hello Bistro!"
"3.0","We loved the food! - Service and seating not so good...First the food!: - We ordered the Mixed Green Salad with fresh lettuce blend tossed with the signature Italian vinaigrette, red onions, pepperoncini peppers and black and green olives.**Spice up your salad with prosciutto and Gorgonzola cheese. Terrific!  -We split the Chick en Cannelloni Pasta tubes stuffed with chicken, spinach, ricotta and mozzarella cheeses with a hint of lemon zest and nutmeg, baked on a bed of rosa sauce. Delicious!! Couldn't get enough.  The meal came with bread and butter.  -Definintely great food this visit.  We will be back to try other dishes.Second, the annoying parts: - Went on a Saturday evening and with no wait time at all, we were directed to a booth up on the third floor (the hostess was kind enough to point out the restrooms on the second floor through the kitchen because I'd never have guessed). Once we sat on the seat we realized this was a broken seat and moved over to a booth that was a bit more comfortable. They need to go over the dinning areas and spruce up the seating and some of the little details of comfort. Third floor was loud and noisy with everyone trying to hear and talk over the other customers (ugg!).-our waiter was a 'just there' good old boy.  Nice, but not at all attentive nor did he really understand wine ordering.  We did not get any water, and we had ordered a 9 oz. craft of wine and had to wait until we were half done eating to get a 'Bottle' of wine!.  We told him we didn't order a bottle but a craft and I watched from my seat while he poured the whole bottle into a huge glass craft which was not even on the menu!  By now we had completed over half of our meal and were dying of thirst so we simply poured out 2 glasses of wine and had him take back the rest. Overall we enjoyed the meal and will go back but try for a different spot to eat, and make sure we point to the menu for everything we are ordering, and ask for water First Thing!~"
"3.0","Pretty good food, but very high prices and small portions... Two of us ate with two drinks spent $85 and left a little hungry... I did not hate my time there but I could not see myself going back"
"5.0","Organized wait line and adequate wait time. Fast and friendly service and wonderful breakfast and brunch food! We will be returning!!"
"5.0","Awesome burger!!!Fast, friendly service.Try the fried goat cheese appetizer.  I'm not from around here but will be back."
"2.0","bartender was attentive and helpful with questions. beer was adequate, nothing outstanding. burgers were smallish and / or overpriced. fries were underwhelming if you like them crispy. happy hour is a nice value but was surprised how empty it was considering half price. glass bottle water was an unexpected twist, kind of sad that is what stands out. if you sit at the bar, beware of bartender dropping glass into trash (or recycling) startlingly loud!! not sure if it was deliberate, but it was annoying and likely not very safe. meh at best."
"4.0","Terrific food and a great location. I attended a rooftop reception there, sponsored by Pittsburgh powerhouse Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney, and had a GREAT time! The restaurant on the street level was packed and the staff was friendly and responsive. Seems like a really popular place, even on a Wednesday night! I'll definitely be back!"
"5.0","New cafe in the neighborhood. Great spot, really nice owner who is clearly very thoughtful about the dishes she creates. There are lots of homey touches of local foods from her hometown so lots to explore. I got a breakfast omelette and my husband got the pork loin sandwich. Both delicious! Would definitely go back."
"4.0","Fun atmosphere; salmon salad good but somewhat over cooked. Shrimp appetizer was delicious. Crab cake sandwich was good. Had a large party, and food was served in a timely manner"
"5.0","Seems like this place always has a new excellent beer on tap as well as a new menu option available. If you can't decide on food the pierogi is very good and you won't go wrong with any of the sandwiches."
"4.0","I love eating at Kiku, I've tried their Sushi about 15 times and I have never been disappointed. They have the best Miso Soup in the city.  The atmosphere is elegant and the service is always excellent. Watch for their specials, they have an 'all you can eat' night that is a good deal."
"4.0","I visited Cinderlands for the 2nd time and thought I should update my review! We visited on a Sunday evening around 6:00 pm- it wasn't too busy at the time and we found a table easily. Last time I visited, I was a little disappointed that I didn't try more beers, so I made a point to try more this time! First and foremost, the descriptions for the beers are ON POINT. They perfectly describe the flavors of the beer and the magic that happens in your mouth. Although they don't have a large selection of beer, I am totally ok with that at a brewery, because they are actually making these beers from scratch. I was also personally excited to see they had two sours on tap, as sour beers are my current FAV. Here are the beers I tried:Grizzled Canary: Lemony aroma with a sour and slightly sweet taste and a hint of herb in the back of your tongue. REALLY good. 4/5Bog Whipper: Carbonated orange citrus goodness. Deliciously sour. 3.5/5Midnight Ramble: Literally tastes like a dark chocolate and raspberry chocolate bar. Dark tartness and the raspberry is there at the end. Full bodied and robust. 4/5I loved the beer. For food, the boyfriend went with the spicy fried chicken sandwich (bleu cheese dressing / iceberg lettuce / pickles / martin's potato roll / $14) without the blue cheese dressing. I went with the winter salad (radicchio / belgian endive / fennel / red onion / cara cara orange / quince sherry mustard vinaigrette / $8) and the 'sweet potato' (parmesan tempura / muhamarra / aleppo sumac honey / pickled chiles / cilantro / mint / $12) which was basically steamed sweet potato that was then fried (so it was super soft on the inside and crispy on the outside), served with a spicy indian-like sauce, herbs, and drizzled with honey. The sweet potato dish was absolutely delicious, but it is really spicy, so be cautious when ordering! The winter salad was not very good- it was entirely too bitter. All of the veggies are essentially pretty bitter on their own and the dressing didn't really take any bitterness away. The cara cara orange was also pretty bitter. I wouldn't order that again. Bren liked his sandwich a lot, but wasn't a fan of the seasoning on the fries. Later in the evening, we met up with a group of friends here and I tried the spent grain chicharrones ($7) which are crispy and thin and I think it's so cool they make them with grains from their beer brewing process. What a cool way to re-purpose the grains! They were delicious and the beer cheese they were served with was good as well.Overall, I had a great time at Cinderlands. I really want to come back and try more beers- especially when they do another collaboration with the Pittsburgh Juice Company!"

"5.0","My typical Friday night includes a random cute girl and a bottle of Champagne. I like to call this concept 'Chick N Bubbly.' What to get: Korean Chicken Wings.What not to get: STDs from the gorgeous girls at U Pitt and nasty boys not from U Pitt that come here to pick them up.What else to get: Black Milk Tea with Tapioca Balls.What else not to get: Creepy Staring Syndrome with Blue Balls.For awhile, Chick N B was one of my fave things in Pitt. The bubble tea the girl recommended on my first visit was an original black tea and it was yummy. So creamy and thick and delicate and just the way I like it. It reminded me of the milk tea at Coco, a chain that is especially popular in Flushing NYC. The Korean chicken wings were off the charts good. A bit like Country Sweet (in Rochester) but better. I don't usually like sweet food unless it's a dessert, but these wings had it going on. Plus I appreciated that it cost me under 10 for the chicken and the tea. And that first time I came had lovely service too. Very busy, decent wait time, but so worth it. Awesome experience.I even wrote this about my experience, after my first visit:(1) The creamiest, sexiest, most delicious milk Bubble Tea outside Coco (Queens NYC). Absolutely heavenly. Their other flavours are pretty good too, not to the same degree as the original.(2) Ridiculously delicious sriracha-infused Korean Chicken Wings. This was the first place I ever tried KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) and if this is anything to go by, I'm going to love it long long time.Unfortunately, my experiences since then have been less stellar. The wings are still amazing, and still deserve five stars. But the bubble tea has been inconsistent, and has not been nearly as enjoyable the last few times. I can't figure out what's different. It might be the creamer, it might be the tapioca itself, but also it might be that my bubble tea appreciation and tastes are becoming refined and more picky very rapidly, since I've had so much damn bubble tea lately. In any case, I'd rather get my bubble tea from I Tea Cafe in Shadyside, Sumi's in Squirrel Hill, or Love Yogurt right here in Oakland, these days. Also the service here the last few times has left something to be desired, and the most recent time they kept getting my order wrong. However, I will say that they did (eventually) fix it (begrudgingly) after I forced the issue (and by issue I mean I need to stop using so many parentheses).These days I think the BT tastes more like Kung Fu Tea than Coco. Which is not as good, because of the creamer used. Nevertheless, the BT here is still enjoyable, and the Korean Wings are excellent, as are prices.And my gf is pretty awesome. She's a cool chick, and bubbly. And when I say bubbly, I mean this in multiple ways, with emphasis on the word multiple. And by that I mean that when we are, you know, she often, well, basically, and you will not believe this and it should not be written on Yelp and it's very personal and intimate, but I'm going to tell you anyway... she tends to randomly and spontane(You have reached the character limit for this review. Thank you for reading.)"
"5.0","My favorite spring rolls in Pittsburgh. I always get extra for lunch the next day. Also, this is my favorite place for Pho. The owners are always super nice and the service is fast."
"5.0","I love their fried wings!!  Always good!  Whenever I am on the Northside, that is my go to place. The prices are reasonable. Also try the Mac and cheese and cornbread."
"5.0","Came on a Wednesday for breakfast, the place was empty and we were sat immediately. The farmer crepe and chevre omelette we ordered were both delicious. The back porch with all the colorful umbrellas is a great place to chill out and enjoy your meal."
"4.0","In the midst of a busy Saturday on the South Side, Delanie's is a calm spot in the storm.  I stopped for a to-go cup so I could enjoy a non-snowy day walking around South Side while waiting for a group for lunch.The barista was pleasant (and didn't show annoyance when I changed my order from 'for here' to 'to go;' though he hadn't actually poured anything, he did need to wash cups for us).  The atmosphere was calm even though it was semi-busy.  It looks like a great place to stay and work on your laptop or study with plenty of tables and chairs available.The coffee, a Costa Rican that day I believe was very tasty.  I would have liked something a little deeper, but it was mellow and fresh (and not burned...ahem, you know who you are, chain coffee guys!)I would love to try some of their lattes - the menu is plentiful and interesting.  I had a sample of a mocha brownie and would love a full version of their pastries, too."
"4.0","Excellent lunch plate. We got the plates that included the Vindaloo and Butter Chicken respectively. Tons of flavor, generous portion, fast service and friendly staff. It's not a 5 star restaurant, but for lunch or take out, I'll definitely be back.The food didn't feel too fattening and wasn't greasy. They used higher end ingredients versus the cheaper gamey meats sometimes used in Indian food."
"2.0","Girl worker with blonde hair with a nose ring I guess told her friends to come and are just swearing the whole time. I usually get my food in 5 minutes it took 20 nobody else is here."
"2.0","I like the concept here. I can customize my salad and dress it with ENP ranch, but it just never lives up to expectations - I am not referring to taste.  Today's experience:  waited at the register for 5 solid minutes while all of the visible employees made eye contact, but didn't say anything like 'oh someone will be with you shortly.'  I started to wonder if I came in 5 minutes before close, but it was 3pm.  Cashier worked the register with her gloves on, the same ones that were being used to prepare food minutes ago.  My salad greens were turning brown, toppings bar was messy and commingled together (If I wanted celery I had to risk also getting beets, eggs, and chickpeas), and I ate a few bites where I felt like I was crunching on sand.  Unpleasant and disconcerting.  Ugh - I just don't think I can continue to eat here without risking illness."
"5.0","Came back to my favorite breakfast place, it looks like they changed alot of things, menu and wall decor. I ordered mr green savory crepe, spinach and melted cheese topped with glaze and i also got nutella love that is very delicious, if ur looking for quite coffee shops its very good option in the mornings."
"5.0","Very interesting Chipotle. It is right between Carnegie and Pitt but I have never seen it really busy. This is the only two story Chipotle I have ever seen. You order downstairs and the seating is up stairs. There isn't much parking available around it so you'll have to find some street parking."
"1.0","Worst restaurant to go in Pittsburgh! If you want to wait for for your food for more than an hour then that's the place. The hostess set us down right and it took 20 minutes for a waiter to come and get our order and drinks. I would get it if it was busy but it was almost empty! No wonder it was empty there service sucks! Then an hour passed our waiter disappeared and I had to ask another waiter for our food because my one year old was soo hungry like come on! So our food was brought but it was wrong and I had it! Wanted to talk to the manager and ask to talk to him he never showed up! No one came after  30 good minutes passed by our baby was no one came with the check out food was wrong we didn't even eat it we left! Never again! Guys don't go eat there!!!"
"5.0","Came here a few weeks ago while I was in Pittsburgh and it was absolutely wonderful. It's run by a local Turkish family that are all super super nice and friendly. They open early and have a lot of choices of seating. I sat on the back patio which was off the street and nice and quite and had such cute decorations with the umbrellas and yard things. My waiter was very friendly and I ordered first an iced chai tea latte that was delicious with just the right amount of cinnamon on top. I then ordered a ham and Brie crepe for my meal that came with a side salad that was delicious! I was content when I left but stayed a while I read my book. Staff didn't rush me out or anything which was nice so I got to take my time sipping and eating. Would love to come here again and try something else off of their wonderful menu!"
"4.0","This is a very good addition in the neighborhood. Very tasty food, polite and quick service and a great environment. The patio is a great hang out spot for the summer! I will definitely be going back to try out more of their dishes. It is BYOB so bring your drinks!"
"4.0","The restaurant is extremely loud but the food and service are top notch. We had an early dinner for New Year's Eve and the prix fixed was amazing. We'll definitely be back to try different cocktails and menu items."
"4.0","Very cute spot! The photos put off a different vibe than the actual restaurant but that is okay! I am a little confused/out off because they used plastic water bottles. Is there something wrong with tap? Other than that the food was good! Service was alright as well."
"5.0","Very reasonably priced and great food. There's really nothing to say about the ambience. It's school cafeteria kind. I usually take out the beef bacon burger(All halal) or the curries or grilled fish. The naan is amazing! So is the tandoori chicken and mutton curry.The butcher section has marinated meat that's super helpful for a weekday meal. I go here once a week."
"3.0","3.5/5Very cute spot.  It also sells art crafts and super super very super soft alpaca items.  But on to the food as we ordered a lot of interesting items.Limeade:  just like a lemonade but it's fun and different with the lime Chicken empanadas:  flaky and soft.  The filling was good but I thought the chicken was a little dry. Sweet potato chips:  these chips were crispy, thin, and light.  It came with some kind of a dipping sauce, cheesy... ricotta like? I'm not sure but I enjoyed it very much for its freshness.Entrees:  veg and chicken special.  Now I wasn't too crazy for either items.  The chicken was dry, lacking of flavor, and almost kind of rubbery? I would say the veg dish wasn't very interesting as it had almost all the same side dishes as a non-veg meal (salad and rice).  It ended up being a tomato, cheese sauce on top of baked potatoes.  I think everything but the entrees were delicious.Torta de chocolate:  mmmm yes I liked this very much :) soft, moist, ya know all the good things you enjoy with a piece of cake.  I really liked the raspberry compote drizzle on top.I've never had Peruvian food before, but to be honest I don't think this was a good representation of it.  Something was lacking in the entrees but all other things were very tasty."
"4.0","This is a cute little taco stand next to Reyna's on 21st.  I ended up stopping by here with my fiancé for a light afternoon snack after our lunch wasn't enough food for either of us.  The stand wasn't too much to look at as it was a couple of things cobbled together but there was a sign proclaiming their tacos to be the best in the city.  As such I decided to go with a chorizo taco while my fiancé went with the shrimp at $3 each.  The man behind the grill cooked both of them up fresh while also warming the soft tortilla shells.  He asked us if we wanted everything on them and we both said yes not knowing what everything was. It ended up being some lettuce, tomato, cheese, sour cream, cilantro, salt and freshly squeezed lime juice.  I ate my taco right after receiving it and it certainly hit the spot.  The temperature of it was perfect while the chorizo had a nice kick and my favorite part was the lime juice which gave a nice little sourness to combat the heat.  My fiancé also really enjoyed her taco and the shrimp that I tried was good.The bottom line for me is that I would stop by here again in the future.  They had a number of interesting tacos, burritos and empanadas that I noticed on the menu that I am sure I would love."
"1.0","My friend and I received the exact same fraudulent charge on our credit cards after being at The Summit Saturday evening. We both had the same bartender, as well. Coincidence? I'm gonna say NO! Drink there at your own risk. DISGUSTED."
"5.0","I was visiting Pittsburgh for two weeks, ate at almost 10 restaurants and this was my absolute favorite! The place gets really busy, so definitely call ahead of time and make a reservation. The restaurant is tucked away upstairs in a quiet building - climb those stairs, it's worth it! Although the menu isn't too lengthy, I was very overwhelmed because I wanted to order everything! We started with the robatayaki - pork belly and chicken skin. It was seasoned and cooked perfectly! The pork belly was my favorite since the little bit of fat just made it more flavorful. Moving on, we had an appetizer, the server recommended his favorite - zucchini dengaku. It was pan fried zucchini, ground chicken, togarashi, beets, saikyo miso sauce. I'm not even a big fan of zucchini but I can eat this every day! The flavors from the chicken and the miso sauce made the zucchini heavenly.After that, we tried the sashimi plate, which included salmon, tuna, yellowtail, fluke, octopus, striped bass. It was extremely fresh, definitely one of the most fresh fish I've had. We also ordered the eel and spicy tuna hand roll. We also ordered the ramen, which I do not recommend, mushy and plain. Let's stick with the fresh fish and flavorful robatakayi. They also offer a wide variety of alcohol, which is always appreciated after a long day of work."
"4.0","Delicious taco truck in the strip district. Chorizo, carnitas, and chicken tacos were great. Huarache was good, but smaller than we expected - not as much bang for your buck. I'd definitely eat here again."
"5.0","I'm sure Morcilla doesn't need one more review, but +1 for all-around culinary excellence, every time. What a Pittsburgh gem."
"2.0","I have been here 6 times in the past 3 years, and every time its unfortunately a little worse.  Positives: This time I came with my 2 kids and had checked in online so we had no wait for saturday at 11:45am.  they had booster seats which were fine for a 4 year old and 21 month old.  They have adultish pictures for coloring with colored pencils but lots of little games and such available you can grab from the shelves to entertain young and old.  2/3 wait staff were friendly .  good veggie options.  the homemade salsa on my dish was excellent.  the vibe and decor is kinda funky and funNegatives:there really weren't brunch options, the only thing on the menu was breakfast food.  When I came in the past there were definitely more lunch/brunch options. Had come to get the chicken fingers for my daughters, because i remember they were huge and a great value for the price...not available.  the sides were overpriced for what they were and compared to the past.  When I got the brown sugar bacon before it was a hefty pile, this time it was literally 3 pieces of bacon for $6.  The avocado toast was untoasted thin bread spread thinly with mashed avocado and nothing on top, so the bread was almost mushy.  def not worth it.  I got the eggs and grits which was a generous portion, but the grits were too watery, and the cheese was nonexistant.  the 3 chips put in were soggy as a result, and the eggs were flat clumps ('scrambled')There is one large front door, so every time someone enters or exits there is a massive freezing breeze that hits the whole front dining area.  Its really awful.  for 2 mains, 1 kids french toast, 2 sides as above, 2 coffees and 3 club sodas, it was $72 which to me is pretty brutal and unaffordable.   alas don't think we will be back"
"5.0","No matter which location I go to, I am never disappointed with Ruth's Chris.  I would live here if I could...  Feeling hungry?  Try the Porterhouse...AWESOME!"
"5.0","It was so good I came back for more. I stayed in Pittsburgh for the weekend and this little place was down the block. Had dinner and breakfast the next morning here. Baba ganoush was the best I've had and their homemade seitan was great. They had so much great stuff on the menu. Defiantly a destination spot for vegans/vegetarians or just people looking for great food."
"5.0","Family owned and talented owner/Cheif. The Nepalis food is beautiful. you get the feeling you are eating food made at grandmas house. (if she was from Nepal) The Resturaunt is on the second story in a busy street across from park in North side. Upstairs its super roomy and the owner actually built the booths! he is a jack-of all trades. Do also try his homemade hot sauce. He cooks in Gee (refined butter) which is traditional. For me this means I can eat very little on the menu... but I often get his lo-mein with extra brocili and tons of hot sauce (seems masala based). Word from my friends is his 'Chinese food' is zesty and special too."
"1.0","Why on earth does everyone have such a terrible attitude! We stopped in for a quick chicken sandwich & some wedges. The girl who waited on us, Monier (?) Brown had an attitude from the moment we walked in. While taking our order she had her eyes rolled up to the ceiling the entire time, tapping her nails on the register! We were so nice & didn't deserve that at all! I ordered food but after hearing & seeing her terrible attitude, Bobby decided not to order. She literally slammed my cup down & then informed us their pop machine wasn't working. We had a choice of sweetened, unsweetened or raspberry tea as well as water. Her attitude was just beyond disgusting & rude!! We ender up asking her name to call corporate. We couldn't find the corporate number & ended up speaking to the shift manager who said there is no corporate number bc they are transitioning (yeah right) . The manager said she would handle it. That didn't seem to change anything because the cashier & her terrible attitude were still at the register representing this store in a terrible way!!! Never again!!"

"5.0","I love this place. Their chicken with broccoli never disappoints, and their egg rolls are fried deliciousness on a plate. I have been coming here for almost 10 years (since I began working in town), and they have met my every need. Parking is a little dicey, and their seating during lunch is a little tight, but I've always been able to get in within my lunch hour.Great place!!"
"2.0","city works is......disappointing. i've given this place so many tries to redeem itself and it's truly just not worth the experience. my food was so incredibly cold and came out after so long--i would have sent it back but i didn't want to wait another 45 minutes. our water glasses sat empty, and i had to ask multiple times to get ketchup. this has happened multiple times, i swear i'm not just a harsh critic. two stars because the furniture, location, and outdoor seating is nice. besides that, i would avoid it. there's way too many other good options in market square."
"3.0","We came here for our anniversary dinner wanting to do something more casual and it was really just ok.  We loved the decor inside but there was a limited amount of tables so we ended up sitting at the bar.  The bartender was not overly friendly and I felt like could have done more for us.  Really just ok"

"1.0","Oh how I used to look forward to eating breakfast at Coca Cafe.  Times sure have changed!A few weeks ago, I stopped in with my wife for breakfast.  It was a busy Saturday am and we were prepared for the wait.  Immediately, we met the hostess and put our names in and accepted the 30-40 minute wait.  At 40 minutes, we came back to inquire and was told it should only be a few more minutes.  No problem we thought.  20 min later we were seated in the outside patio.  Roughly 15 minutes went by and we were greeted by a server who clearly seemed to be frazzled.  She delivered water and menus and waited a further 15 minutes to take our order.  After 30 minutes went by with no contact or refills of drinks, we just got up and left.  Ugh!  I really was looking forward to an amazing meal.Just 2 days ago, we stopped in again to give them another shot.  This time, we arrived just as they were opening for the day (Saturday).  Immediately, we were seated and given menus.  So far so good!  Wife's water glass had a bit of food on it..oh well we thought, these things happen.  After placing our order my wife used the restroom and said the sink had paper towel in it and the floor was filthy.  As she's telling me this, we both take a look at the floor of the eating area which was in really filthy.  Silverware on the floor, dirt etc.  The place had JUST opened for the day!  We used to love stopping in for a uniquely prepared meal and have told a lot of people how much we loved the place.  Now with today's options in PGH, it's going to be hard to convince me to ever go again."
"4.0","Why is this one so much better than the Oakland location?  I don't really know, but I can say that I'm happy about it.  I put my previous two terrible Oakland experiences aside, braved the new location in Downtown Pittsburgh, and walked away a changed man.First attempt:  late lunch, 1:30 PM, mid-week.  The place was a ghost town (awesome!) I walked right up to the counter, ordered a Rachel burger, and was promptly delivered my burger in a few short minutes.  The burger was good, if not messy, and my only gripe would be that the turkey-burger patty is clearly from frozen.  Nonetheless, still a tasty meal and the place was really clean with super friendly employees.Second attempt:  Noon, mid-week.  The place was packed and there was a decent sized line.  Service was still prompt and while the Salad Bar Engineers did look a bit frazzled, they handled my requests promptly.  Minor disappointment was the meager topping rations provided when I asked for a) chopped eggs b) bacon c) croutons.  If all salad toppings are free, why are you skimping on these things? (And I do mean skimp, like teaspoon size serving.)  Next time I'll be 'that guy' and tell them to double up.  When I finally made my way to the Cold Stone Creamery-esque salad amalgamation station, I was presented with two options: 'Big bites or little bites?'  Unhappy with such restrictions, I countered with 'medium bites?' to a non-plussed chopper.  She did, however, comply with my clearly ridiculous request.  In all, the salad was very good and I'll definitely go back (only to this location).  Oakland-location still needs to learn that avocados aren't supposed to be dark brown when placed on salads and that sweaty forearms are not an appropriate salad tong resting station in-between grabbing items from the salad bar."
"3.0","I recently returned in a simular situation as my last visit. The wait staff were, again, attentive, and three dishes were placed on each table. However, I was not as impressed by their food this time.We started off with the pappadom as an appetizer. Although it had a heavy herb taste, it was also very salty. The chutneys alleviated this somewhat, but I still wasn't a fan. Then, we had chicken tandoori, chicken tikka masala, tarka daal, and chana masala served with naan and rice. My first impression of the chicken tandoori was, again, salty. The chicken itself was well-cooked, and it would've been great with a bit less salt. I found the other three dishes okay, but the chana masala was the only one with any distinctive taste, and even that was mostly spiciness. (Thankfully, it was at a level well within my tolerance.) I didn't find any of them to be great, though. The naan was delicious, as was the rice, which seemed to have another light flavor from herbs or something. For dessert, we finished off with kheer, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Overall, it's a nice, cozy restaurant, but I think there are better Indian restaurants in the area."
"1.0","The pizza was absolutely rancid. I live in a place riddled with horrible 99 cent pizza places which are so bad, a pita with ketchup and government cheese would be comparable. This is WORSE than that. The bread sticks were ... edible, the hotwings were about as good as Dominos (when they feel like being stingy with the sauce), but the onion rings were garbage. Probably frozen, definitely processed, and tasted like cold mashed potatoes that just got a divorce. If this is the only place open and you're hungry late at night, drink some water and have a good breakfast the next day."
"3.0","Given the wide array of chinese, thai, vietnamese, etc. food throughout Pittsburgh, Tram's Kitchen falls somewhere in the middle.The wife and I decided to stop by before an Unblurred Friday on Penn Avenue.  At around 5:30-6pm on a Friday, the place was pretty slow, but that didn't last very long.  By 7pm there was a line of people waiting to get in (there isn't a waiting area, so it seemed most people just waited outside until a table would leave).We decided on spring rolls, pho and the highly regarded pork noodles.Spring rolls - these were the star of the show.  Plump, crisp and plenty of flavor.Pho - the broth itself was some of the best we've had in Pittsburgh, but the rest of the soup really didn't live up to the same standardPork noodles - not too bad...  the pork was great, but there was barely any of it on top of the noodles (maybe a better portion would have changed our thoughts)The owners seemed nice and a bit overworked due to the crowd.  Overall, we're definitely glad we tried it, but I can't see us going back."
"3.0","We had unreasonably slow service that even though I did enjoy my meal, I felt the restaurant deserved a sub-par review. I went with the large group and we surprisingly didn't have to wait for a table on a weekend afternoon. Really like how they have huge circle tables for large groups. However, it took us three hours to finish the meal. Every part of the meal was slow - taking our orders, checks, etc. Our waitress forgot to put in our order, but was nice about it and gave us a free round of drinks. Anyways, I ordered a Blood Mary to start, its highlight is that it's served with two plump shrimp! For my main, I ordered the crab cake sandwich and loved it. Perfect ratio of ingredients, with more crab flavor than breadcrumbs/filling. I'm a HUGE seafood fan, so the food and ambiance are worth a return trip, but I'll be wary if I have time constraints."
"5.0","The cashew cheese with the preservatives is amazing.  The coffee, fried tomatoes, fried cauliflower, and smoky eggplant spread were also delicious."

"2.0","I really want to like this place but on 2 occasions in a row now I've ordered the daily and/or game special and have been charged the full price by the same bartender. You shouldn't have to request the for the special pricing. Needless to say the food is good and the atmosphere is pleasing."
"3.0","Great drinks.  I don't fancy myself a drinker, but the drinks here are why this place is so highly rated.  The food is of a high caliber as well.  Ordered a cheese board and the pork belly ramen.    The food was good enough for a 3-star rating.  Great menu for a bar.  I recommend this place to go if you plan on drinking with friends.   Order some good food, a couple drinks share some laughs.  I was surprised that this place was not hipster.  Huzzah!"
"4.0","Very good food and once we ordered,  it came out quickly. The problem was that they asked if we had reservations,  which we didn't. They said it was a 45 minute wait even though they had plenty of empty tables waiting for reservations which apparently didn't show. So crazy. So many people turned away for nothing.   We ended up at one of the reserved tables that wasn't filled."
"5.0","We were in search of good pizza and we found it! The slices of pizza are absolutely huge. They need 2 plates to serve them and they still hang off the plate. We ordered our slices and sat down. They were ready within minutes. It is a no frills kind of place but they also seem to do a booming take out business. We enjoyed watching people come in to pick up their pizzas in boxes that barely fit through the door because they were so big. You almost have to have the address to find this place because there is no big sign, only a sign on the window. This will be a must for our next visit to the area."
"5.0","best wonton soup in the city.  amazing egg rolls.  sweet aquarium up front.  delicious broccoli with garlic sauce (don't judge me for ordering this).  i will always say 'yes' to coming here!!!  parking can be a bitch, but you're downtown -- so it's no surprise/fault of chinatown inn."
"4.0","Very good. Food and service are excellent. We had the antipasto plate and It was soooo good. I got the meatball dish and the meatballs were so soft and good! Flavor was amazing! My boyfriend got the gnocchi and It was delicious as well. Admittedly I've had better gnocchi but the sauce It was in made up for it. Their sauces were incredible. The only thing about this place you need to know is that IT IS SMALL. And I mean small small. If you sit inside and It gets busy just know you'll be sitting back to back or right next to someone so much you have to shift chairs and tables around just to leave. I get that it's a small face but didn't really enjoy having an older couple give me and my boyfriend dirty looks while we were on our anniversary date. Otherwise it's great food, the owner is very nice and walks around, and service is quick. I'd definitely come here again but sit outside or at an off time!"
"4.0","I've only been here once, but I very much enjoyed the experience and would come again. The beer selection is fantastic, and my food was delicious.The only downside? Surprisingly few vegetarian options, especially if you are strict and don't like to order a meat dish 'without the meat.'  There's only 2 vegetarian grilled cheese choices! (shrooms and plain). I got the shrooms grilled cheese, which was great, but seriously? 2 options? I feel like they're lacking creativity."
"5.0","WOW!I am not even joking, the blueberry ricotta pancakes were the best pancakes of my life. Not gonna lie, the ricotta kind of scared me at first because I didn't want cheesy pancakes. But it made the texture of the pancakes SO FLUFFY! It was almost creamy actually. You can't really taste the cheese because it is so blueberry-y but not overly sweet. A must get.And I got an omelet. It was also SO FLUFFY! It was super thick- almost like an egg cake/souffle type dish. I had it filled with bacon, swiss cheese, and mushrooms and was pleasantly surprised because it wasn't too salty. Just perfect. Definitely come here if you're ever in Pittsburgh! Make sure to get here kind of early too because it gets very busy!"
"3.0","Just opened with nice atmosphere.  Staff is very friendly.  Burgers were OK and pricey for the quality.  Don't think I would go back"
"4.0","The famous corned beef sandwich on Rye is the way to go!"
"5.0","Wow, really good vegan food, not at all the unfortunately frequently found relentless fare.  This is not your retro hippie commune type place. This is creative vegan cooking but without any (Con) fusion cuisine messing about. Buffalo fried cauliflower and fried oyster  mushrooms were special appetizers at our dinner. Both perfectly done and not overdone . Then moussaka , flaffel  and a seitan special, each really full of good flavors,  and in particular, texture combinations and the latter  is something that a lot of  places just do not get and they really need to think about it. Vegan chocolate cake and vegan bittersweet chocolates were both Intense!  Even a meathead could get a meal here they would enjoy!"
"5.0","I got my Sushi Grade Tuna today as PROMISED!Thanks for the great service even if I am to old to get to you. I have been enjoying your food and your beautiful employees over the years.Pete Flarety was our mayor back then.Thank You n your family for being great neighbors I am Pittsburgh Proud of Your Business!!!"
"4.0","Although the service was excellent, our party was disappointed in the steaks. For the price, we had expected a much more tender steak even though the temperature was as we had ordered."
"5.0","So I just realised freshii was opened and have eaten there to days in a row... I absolutely love the menu and everything I have has has been excellent!!! I totally recommend the Baja burrito my current favorite but I still have a lot to try!!!"
"5.0","First time here, it was great very surprised on the sizes and freshness.. Make a pretty good salad and even the price is not bad for everything you get. They are not stingy with their stuff. They were busy and the manager was there ( idk her name ) she was also making salads n helping her staff . Will come back !! Loved my salmon salad !!"
"4.0","Whether you are visiting Phipps or work in Oakland, this is a spot you need to check out for lunch. I heard the hype around this place and have been meaning to check it out so when I had some out of town guests visiting this was the perfect place to take them. It also helped that it was a 70 degree day in November and we were able to sit outside at their patio tables to eat. The menu has soup, salad, sandwiches and pizza to choose from.  They also serve beer and wine-who would have thought!  I went with the chicken Panini sandwich which comes with cheese, field greens and apples.  You have your choice of a few healthly sides and I went with the bruschetta salad which was a mix of fresh salsa and cabbage (almost like coleslaw).  Everything was super fresh and very tasty.  Others in my party got the pizza which is about the size of a plate and ordered a cup of soup as a starter.  They typically have at least 3 soups to choose from and both the tomatoes and squash were favorites at our table.  Also love that they have a lunch combo which you can get a cup of soup or half a salad with half of most of their sandwiches. The prices all range from $8-$10 and the portion sizes are perfect.  Once you order make sure to grab a table and they will bring out your food once ready. On a busy Friday afternoon our orders came out very quickly!"
"5.0","Out of the five or six places I have tried, Delanie's is my favorite coffee in Pittsburgh by far. The prices are reasonable, the staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable, the shop is cute/clean and even the food is good! What really impresses me is the passion with which the baristas talk  about coffee. They are totally nerdy about it (in the best way possible) and go out of their way to help you get the best cup possible. If you're in the neighborhood, definitely stop in at Delanie's--you won't regret it!"
"5.0","I was able to catch this food truck outside of Leaning Cask Brewery.  I was intrigued by the truck and wasn't sure what to expect. They were super friendly, the food was awesome, and it was super quick.  I wasn't sure about getting thw lwttuce and green onions on my rice and meat bowl. I got the beef and spicy pork. It was fantastic. The fried dumplings are out of this world good. Definitely get an extra order. I am so happy with the friendly smiles and service I recieved. They were fast and efficient and friendly. I will definitely go back. One of the best food trucks in PA."
"4.0","Chik'N, the new Nashville-inspired chicken joint in the heart of Oakland is basically the real deal. Ratings and descriptions below:Chicken sandwich- hot; 4.3/5Ample heat, moist chicken breast, and a tangy coleslaw on brioche fill out a pretty amazing sandwich. Heat level of 'Hot' has a spice that you can enjoy while eating, yet doesn't leave a lingering sting. If I had to offer one improvement, I wish the breading was crispier. Mac n cheese; 4.6/5The Mac n cheese is a standout on the menu. A rich and thick white cheese sauce over elbow macaroni is topped with some colorful paprika, and tastes just about as good as it gets, although I could see how someone may think it's too thick. French fries; 3.5/5The French fries are crinkle-cut and also seasoned with a spice blend. Seeming to be of the priorly frozen variety, they were crispy and seasoned well, but uninspired. Ambiance; 4.2/5The building itself is large, with ample seating downstairs accompanying the counter and kitchen, and upstairs is a large TV and more seating. There seemed to be about 10 beers on tap and a hearty selection of bottles. While we took our food to-go, you wouldn't have to twist my arm to come back and eat-in. Service; 4.7/5Fast and efficient. The cashiers were taking orders and also bussing tables and wiping counters, while the cooks were busy whipping up your meal in plain sight. These people were rapid-fire cranking out orders. We went in on a Tuesday evening, but it was fairly busy. Kudos to them. Value; 4.4/5This place does not accept cash, which is no biggie (rewards points on credit cards, duh), and the menu was fairly priced with decent sized portions. Later, raters!-Pat"
"4.0","I have been craving Indian food lately and when someone overheard me say that, they quickly recommended Prince of India. I was told they had a buffet and right then and there I knew this was going to be the place to satisfy my Indian food craving! I am by no means an Indian food conniseur, so I will not be able to go into strict detail about each item, but what I can do is tell you how delicious everything was and how great of service they had! The food was delicious, plentiful and hot. They had everything I wanted to satisfy my Indian food craving and some! There were items I never had before like these sweet little balls on the buffet that were to die for! The chicken was all cooked to perfection and the taste was just right. The food was definitely on the less spicy end but that was ok. My favorite part about the meal was the naan! We got garlic naan with our meal and it was hands down the best naan I have ever had! All in all I was debating between giving this place 4 or 5 stars. I usually keep the 5 star reviews for a knock your pants off type of meal and atmosphere so I went with 4. That doesn't mean this place wasn't amazing! For a $13 Indian buffet this is tough to beat. They also offer alcohol, desserts, student discounts and more! I will 100% be returning to Prince of India every time my Indian food cravings return!"
"3.0","Full disclosure: this was my first time visiting a ramen restaurant, so I have nothing to compare it to and I probably should've researched beforehand. We started out with veggie and crab bao buns, and they were absolutely worth it - I'd come back again exclusive to eat those!  I ordered the ramen with chicken in it and was a little less impressed with that. The portion was pretty large, but it was incredibly difficult to eat. I'm not very skilled with chopsticks and the noodles don't really cooperate with a spoon... but I suspect that's more my issue than Ki Ramen's! The fried chicken pieces were also really large, making them tough to eat but tasted fine once I could cut them up a little. Zack, our waiter, was incredibly friendly, attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. He gave us numerous suggestions and I felt like he helped us make some good choices."
"1.0","If you go fifteen minutes before closing time, you get a 'oh crap' !! Either you make my meal or tell me you are closed so I can go somewhere else."
"4.0","Went yesterday for my parents 30th anniversary. We went for a late lunch so the restaurant was empty when we arrived. Our waiter was fabulous! He was very attentive and wanted to make sure the experience was wonderful for my parents. We started with wine and apps, and I loved the fried zucchini. It wasn't overly breaded and were were able to split it between six people and not worry about not having enough. I ordered a Malfada pasta with feta spinach and sundried tomatoes and it was excellent! It was the perfect portion and spiced wonderfully. My parents each got chicken parm and devoured it.  All in all a wonderful experience and we will definitely return."
"5.0","Great service! small buffet 2-3 chicken choices rice and 3-4 side options but all very tasty best mint chutney I've ever had!"
"1.0","Walked in, the place was empty and then the smell hit us, sewage or super bad drains, too bad for such a historic place. Possibly was an off day?"
"4.0","I was Impressed the many times I visited here. The food seems to be high quality. Some of the best tasting subs I've had. Nice indoor and outdoor seating."
"5.0","The food was wonderful and so was the whole experience.  I walked by it earlier in the day today and decide to try it for dinner. It had a pleasant looking outside eating area,that is sort of on a deck, I.e, elevated 1/2 a story above the sidewalk.I did have dinner there and was more than pleased.  The food was fresh and delicious. Everyone was very satisfied. The shepherds salad was simple and beautiful. My dining companions said it was excellent eventhough it was just tomatoes, cucumbers, etc.I had the lamb/beef Kofte and the lentil soup. Both were greatWe also shared superb grape leaves and a suave eggplant salad that we all liked better than baba ganoush.The service was also very attentive. There was plenty of food and they offered to put it in Togo containers.We did sit on the deck in mid 70 degree weather. It was very pleasant. The inside was super nice too. We did not realize, but it's a BYOB place.On the way out the owner greeted us warmly.We left a a happy group of satisfied diners."
"1.0","Went to this place on a business trip. I  didn't expect much from a Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh, but I didn't expect the food to be lower grade than your elementary school cafeteria.I ordered the Cancun burrito. The tortilla was too thick and not soft and thin like it should be. The shrimp was not deveined and the steak was mediocre. The burrito doesn't come with beans, so there's not much to work with besides steak and vein popping shrimp smothered in grossamole--which was below average as well. $12.99 haha heeeeelllll naw, would go for $6.99 tops and expected to be served in a shanty, hole in the wall eatery. Another neg was the time you spend waiting for the food, was with a group of 11 and it took 2.5 hours. Better to just dine on the chips and salsa, that's the only good part"
"2.0","Very averageFood kind of sucks and is priced on the higher side for bar food. You're paying to sit along the river."
"5.0","Delicious! Servers are just the right amount of attentive. Try the Dan Dan Ramen..So much flavor. Nice atmosphere and good music. Highly recommend."
"5.0","I've been here 3 times for brunch and have had a great experience each time. The wait isn't long, the service is good, and the food has been consistently tasty.I would highly recommend the falafel and the cookies. I get hungry just thinking about it!"
"5.0","The best brunch place in Pittsburgh, hands down. Located in the super hipster Lawrenceville, this place is my go-to restaurant for a great start to the day. It has this cute diner vibe and is always packed with people. They don't take reservations for brunch - you can call and put your name on the list so its first come/call, first serve. But trust me, it is 110% worth the wait.For your beverages, make sure you order one of their freshly squeezed juices. They make it in house and have such wonderful concoctions. I'm particularly fond of their pear honeydew pineapple juice. It is just the right level of sweet and tart. You'll have to stir it a bit occasionally for the consistency to be right. It is SO SO SO good though. I've also tried the matcha tea latte, which wasn't the best I've had. The matcha tasted a bit funky, and the latte itself wasn't made that well.Anyway, on to the starters. Banana bread with honey walnut cream cheese and fruit? Amazing. Bread is wonderfully moist and soft - not stale at all and not too sweet. Avocado toast with a drizzle of honey? My favorite. Sounds like a strange combo but I promise you it just works.Brunch menu always changes when I go, which makes it exciting. I've tried their pumpkin pancakes with maple butter and caramelized pears. The pancakes are so soft and you probably won't be able to finish them (HUGE portion size) . The pears were my favorite part. If you have a giant sweet tooth, this is your dish.I've also had their scallop eggs benedict. It's not on their website menu since I guess it's a rotational one, but I loved it. I think it's my favorite brunch dish I've had there. The scallops were so large and juicy and went perfectly with the hollandaise sauce. Normally, with eggs benedict, restaurants kind of just give up on the English muffin part and it's just that - a plain English muffin. But they toasted it here and did something with it to make it stand out to me (I don't know what).Another thing I've tried is their house cured and tea-smoked salmon omelet with goat cheese, dill, and roasted tomatoes. The goat cheese threw me off at first (wasn't expecting it in an omelet, or with salmon), but it was surprisingly pretty good. This was your standard breakfast omelet with a twist. Finally, I've also tried the savory duck crepe with Asian slaw and two sunny side up eggs. This dish was interesting. Slaw wasn't my favorite, but then again, I never like slaw. Eggs were fine. Duck was fine. I think it was just confusing to me in the way they presented the dish. They hid the crepe part on the bottom, covering it with the duck confit, slaw and eggs. I completely missed the crepe part until I ate through the dish and saw it, and by then, it was all soggy and unappealing. I wish they had presented it in a way where it preserved the integrity of the 'crepe,' especially as they were calling it a crepe dish. Otherwise, this place is truly a neighborhood gem. It's also a short walk from Espresso A Mano, a fantastic coffee shop. Smaller groups fare better here and be ready to wait at least 30 minutes if you come on a popular brunch day!"
"4.0","This is a very nice local Liberty Avenue joint in Bloomfield. The food is relatively affordable and tastes very fresh. The options for dishes are somewhat limited as a vegetarian since they do limited seasonal dishes, but I am always able to find something and I always leave very satisfied. Consistent joint and you can't go wrong."
"3.0","Stopped in for a couple of iced coffee's and some dessert was told at the register you can't sit inside if you don't spend enough on food you have to sit outside 94° outside today I said keep your chairs  I will go somewhere where our money is appreciatedI'm giving three stars because I don't know about the quality of their product. All I know is your attitude and management is missing the boat. More people should walk"

"5.0","I've been going to Peppi's since the mid 90s at their various locations.  This place is still the best sandwich shop in Pittsburgh.  Primanti's can get all the press, but seriously- Peppi's is far superior."
"5.0","Amazing staff always going above and beyond to accommodate the group I make dinner reservations for. We've hosted several dinners there with out VIPs and heard nothing but good reviews on food, service and atmosphere. Dietary restrictions across the board and everyone can find something delicious they are telling ppl about days later. Highly recommend!"
"3.0","I love indian food and I consider Tamarind as Pittsburgh's one of the best indian places. The portions are generous and service is great. I got the usual chicken tikki masala and the sauce was great to dip in my garlic naan. My bf got some lamb dish with green sauce ( I dont remember the name) which had unique great flavor as well. I asked my dish to be spicy but it was not. I know I am pretty good with spicy food but I know how HOT Indian food can get. So this one thing put me down a little on my visit but other than this, the soft chicken went well with fluffy white rice warm naan. The lamb was tender too and didn't give off that 'lamb smell' much. Everytime I go back to Pittsburgh, Tamarind is always on my 'must go back' list. The staff will greet you kindly, prices are reasonable for the generous portions, and the food comes out quick enough so you don't start to get frustrated. I would give 3.5 stars. Even though it is my fav indian place in Pittsburgh, I feel like there is a better place somewhere out there. So as of now, it is a 3.5 for me~"
"5.0","This place was so good! I really wanted the jumbo lump crab eggs Benedict but sadly the last one was sold right before I ordered. I had a delicious omelette instead and my hubby and I split the ricotta blueberry pancakes. They were so fluffy and so good. I'm not a big pancake eater but I'd have them again. Order at the counter and pay for food, it's delivered to your table and you can leave when finished without having to wait for the check. I'll definitely go back. Sandwiches looked awesome and the two guys cooking were so good. Fully seated and they were turning it out as fast as orders came in. Great spot for brunch."
"4.0","This is my go-to Chinese place. Super-fast delivery, solid staples for a typical Chinese place. By far the best part of ordering China Wok is the phone call. I once dreaded the sharp orders coming through the other line, but I've come to appreciate the humor and adventure in successfully placing an order. Just make sure you check the menu first before you call. If you hesitate on the phone, watch out! (It's awesome)"
"4.0","Hip spot on Butler Street.  We came here after a Steelers game -- somehow my friend got us reservations!  I have been to Spain many times.  Upon entering, I was reminded of some of the restaurants in Spain.  The Jambon hanging from the ceiling is truly a sight...and I do not eat pork.We were promptly seated at our table.  Drinks came quickly.  The wine arrived without delay.  In true tapas fashion, we ordered a series of dishes for the table.  The gazpacho was amazing -- one of the best I have had.  The potatoe bravas were great - the aoli was really flavorful.  I would also recommend the Octopus which was also a great dish.  I was encouraged to try the ox tail as my buddy swears by it.  I did not like but he seemed to love it.  The salads were great.   Perhaps my favorite dish was the cauliflower.   We had the churro for desert.  This was a little disappointing.  I would not get it again.  But the cappuccino was nicely done as was the sherry.  So the desert drinks more than made up for it.I would love to come back and try more things on the menu!"
"3.0","We made reservations online through yelp for 8:15pm as that was the first time that was available. Once we arrived there was a sign that said 'private party' until 845pm. She mentioned that we can wait at the bar and they were hoping to finish the party up and get us seated by 8:15p. No big deal, we headed to the bar. Had a few drinks and the pretzel app. Decent pretzel. Good signature drink options, loads of beer choices too. We were seated at 8:45pm. I ordered the yard burger. Which was really good, I'd skip the fries. Someone else in my party ordered the keilbasa and pierogi supper, it was 'fine'. Someone else ordered Big Cho-Bowski, she really liked the sandwich, didn't care for soup and didn't eat the fries because it was too much food. From what I saw everyone mainly orders the grilled cheese and I can appreciate that. The bread is thick cut and it is their thing. But if you don't feel like eating that, I'd vote yard burger everyday. It really was tasty. Three stars because of the wait, which I know isn't in their control in, but we shouldn't have been able to book a reservation for a time they couldn't accommodate. We will go again.  I will update then."
"5.0","A fun place!  A definite NYC vibe going on here and it works. Cramped, crowded and full of life.  Good food and fun people watching."
"5.0","This place is so so delicious. I'm not vegan but this place has inspired me to bring more vegan and vegetarian foods into my life. I had the fresh spring rolls, 'coffins', hot lychee tea, and a great vegan donut for dessert."
"1.0","Good food the meat and noodles especially. Slightly expensive, but petty immature ownership."
"5.0","Had an awesome dining experience here this past weekend. There were so many great options on the menu and decided to do the prefixe so that we could try a little bit of each. We started with the roasted carrots and parissimon appetizer, and loved it. I have never had parissimon before but loved the sweet, subtle, and refreshing taste, complimenting the beautifully roasted carrots (and awesome cheese!). Our main course consisted of the steak and carrot Bolognese. I'm not much of a meat eater out of fear the meat will be too chewy, but the steak was cooked perfectly, easily chewed and enjoyed. Although the carrot bolognese did not contain any meat, you the texture of the purée made you certain there was. And to top it all off, we devoured the lavender pound cake and salted popcorn pannacotta! Highly recommend coming here for a classy night out."
"5.0","Perfect burger establishment. What an amazing restaurant   from all the local beers ingredients and decor....everyone needs to experience this piece of pittsburgh heaven. Can't speak enough about the delicious burgers and chicken sandwiches"
"2.0","Wow.  How far we have fallen.  This place used to be THE best steaks in town.  Went here last night for a friends birthday.  Our bill was over $400.  Tip was $120.  We are all in the business.  What a disappointment.  Mine and my buddies $52 ribeye were med well to well done after ordering it medium.  We don't complain, we just eat it.  The lobster mac had 3 pieces of lobster in it with some melted cheese on top of Kraft Mac noodles.  $22!!!  Really??  Service was OK.  I get it, it was a Tuesday night, but charging this much and not getting anywhere close on delivery is a shame.  We counted 32 covers last night from 730-945 when we left.  With quality and service down I'm not surprised.  With 55 years experience between the four of us in the business and owning 2 establishments in Pittsburgh, we were very dissatisfied.  This is the 'service' industry and you missed the mark tonight.  Sorry Ruths Chris, I work Wed-Sat nights and the only time we get to go out is Sun-Tue and if this is the best you have to offer, you need to step up your game even if it is an 'off' night."
"1.0","Aside from the sub par Americanized Mexican food, the place is so small that you can't even sit down and enjoy your fake tacos. Do yourself a favor and look up Las Palmas. There are two of them within five minutes from South side. Another one in Washington and another in Oakland. If you're going to be forced to stand up and eat your tacos, you might as well go get some real tacos made by real Mexicans, not 'hipsters'"
"5.0","We were visiting Pittsburgh recently, and of course tried as many vegan or vegan-friendly places as possible. B52 stood out. We went for a weekday breakfast, so those were the only foods we tried. Our waitress was super friendly and attentive, and helped us choose amongst the multiple tempting choices on the menu. I got the spicy kofta tofu scramble, which was truly amazing. I've had a lot of scrambles, but this one was especially good. We tried the cashew cheese mannish (flatbread) too, and that was great. And don't miss the baked goods - the brownie was fair, but the chocolate chip cookies were divine, and vegan cinnamon rolls? I can be pretty picky about those, but these were perfect. So glad to have found this place!!"
"4.0","If you've spent any amount of time in the Adams Morgan district of Washington, D.C. (or anywhere in VA, really) then this is not a new concept. Enter the jumbo slice o' pizza! This place conjured up memories of drunken stupors w/ friends in search of anything edible after the bars closed down, then waking up the next a.m. only to find pizza sauce splatter on the crotch of your favorite pair of khakis. I digress. BF's pizza, be it slices or whole pies, are thin but simply colossal. While not my favorite pizza in da 'burgh, it's a true-blue go-to for late night eats. Order. Wait. Eat. Repeat. Oh yeah, it's also of the few places you can get Cheerwine in a glass bottle."
"4.0","I have been here about 10 times. The nitro coffee is very good. Most of the coffee drinks are good. My favorite sandwich is the chicken pesto on ciabatta, and I order it almost every time.I wish they had more pastries that were like danishes and donuts, rather than cupcakes, biscotti and small macarons, which they have."
"4.0","A friendly place with great seafood.  It is cash only. The clam chowder was meaty and creamy.  The onion rings were crispy and so was the fish. A nice place to see local flair"
"5.0","Food is a bit over priced for what it is. Trendy spot, hipster atmosphere. I love their egg custard as it is one of my favorite comfort food, they get the consistency and flavor very well. The noodle dishes are big enough as an entree for one person, but the ramen is kinda oily. They have good specials everyday so check with the hostess before you order."
"4.0","We tried the Pierogis and sandwiches.  The food was pretty good.  I liked that they served sour cream with their pierogis.  I liked that the Pierogis were slightly crispy.  The only reason this was not a 5-star is because they kinda made a big deal about my extremely well behaved service dog.  They requested to her license which is actually illegal to ask for.  I hope that Jerome Bettis' Grille's management will post the service dog laws in their back room and educate their employees about the legalities.   Here's a link: https://www.ada.gov/service_animals_2010.htm"
"3.0","Since Eat N Park has gone through their major remodels, I've found myself stopping into the various locations around the area. Our go to has usually been the Dormont ENP, but if the parking lot is full, we know of a few alternate spots, and Banksville is usually the other option. My daughter, and I (sound familiar?!) have begun making Saturday morning brunch our time to catch up, and eat of course. We found a parking spot without any trouble, and didn't have to wait more than five minutes to be seated. The new building seems to have brightened things up, and the food was good. My daughter wasn't able to order her usual Caramel Mocha joka drink she likes, the machine was down according to the waitress. We both ordered the Super Griddle Smiles, hers with Banana Foster French Toast, and mine with the Smiley Waffle, yum! Our food was good, nothing came out greasy, plates were clean, and the food cooked well. The only no biggie issue was my daughter had to wait for her order of potato pancakes, and my order for potato pancakes somehow turned into home fries. I'm not one to freak out over a minor slip like this, but having worked in the industry, the ticket should've been checked, and the plates should've been checked before being served. Attention to detail, that's all.Overall, I'm happy to see the remodels of the Eat N Parks, and don't mind stopping in for breakfast with family, and friends."
"5.0","This is my favorite Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh. It has amazing sauces for their pastas and overall a great homemade taste. The main dishes come with a salad or soup to start with and bread. The staff is always friendly and provides excellent service."
"1.0","We've been to this place twice in the last month and it was bad both times. The first time we called ahead with our order and went in to pick it up. It took us about 20 minutes to get there so we figured the order would be almost ready. We waited another hour. We were on our lunch break from work so we rushed back to the office with our order to discover that they made a mistake with almost everyone's lunch. Out of 5 meals they only got my order correct. Unfortunately, they undercooked mine.The second time was just the other day (4/27/2016). Rather than call ahead we just went in and placed our orders in person. There were three of us this time. One person's order came out almost immediately, but he was missing half of what he had asked for. Our other two orders took over an hour to come out (just a salad and a hamburger - nothing crazy). We only got them because my coworker basically stormed their kitchen to get our food. The manager apologized and gave us two gift cards. We checked them today. The balance on both cards is ZERO. The food isn't terrible, but it's definitely not worth the consistently bad service."
"5.0","I came here today with 18 other people today after my little sister's graduation from Duquesne.  Noah was my server and she was one of the most talented and kind servers I've ever had.  She knew every single person's order and kept track of each check!  Not a single one of us had an issue with our food and she kept up with refills, timing of the food, and any other special requests.  Nobody had to remind her of a drink or food - she knew everything.  If I lived in the area, I'd come back to have Noah as my server every time.Also, my mother is very allergic to seafood, so the manager came out to assure her that the food was not going to be contaminated and she could eat it!FANTASTIC SERVICE!"
"5.0","This is the single best place in Pittsburgh to get a slice of pizza. It's bigger than your head, so start with just one slice, not many people can finish more than that. And in my opinion you shouldn't order one with toppings since they're not cooked in the pizzas, they're just added on top and reheated. But it's an excellent slice, New York style, thin crispy crust, zesty cheese. One small criticism, I wish they'd keep a container of Gel GRANULATED garlic to sprinkle on top, not the garlic salt that they have since it makes the pizza too salty. If you remember Pizza Sola on Carson St., that used to be good, but it is GONE now. It was bought out and renamed almost identically as 'Sola Pizza' and is no longer any good. Benny Fierro's is almost as good and a bigger slice. Decor isn't anything to write home about and the staff are 'minimally functional' at best, so you're not going here for the ambience."
"3.0","Stopped in here to eat the other day and it smelled like a toilet. Waiting past the entry for. A few minutes and the smelled continued. The food is not bad, the service is good. The girls there at lunch time do a good job! The lunch specials are reasonable and the place is not bad. But they need to fix whatever is causing the odor at the front door. It was terrible and I did not want to eat there because of it."
"5.0","Wow just wow. I had been wanting to try this place ever since I saw it featured in Bon Appetit's Hottest New Restaurants in 2016. Came here on a friday around 5 ish. It is a very cozy restaurant with warm lighting. Once we were seated, our server went through the menu telling us her favorites and recommendations. It was helpful as the menu can be a bit overwhelming and we just wanted to order everything. We ended up ordering the fuet, chorizo, queso en aceite, bacalao, leeks a la parilla, the costillas de la matanza, and the crema catalana. First the queso en aceite came out and it was amazing. The warm bread dipped in the olive oil and marinated manchego was just delicious. Then the salami and chorizo came out. The salami had hints of garlic and was perfect with the toasted bread and pickled peppers. The chorizo took some getting used to as I had never had dates, blue cheese, and chorizo before. I definitely would love to come back to try the charcuterie platter of all the meats!The bacalao was the only thing I didn't love although my friend thought it was great. The fish was shredded so it just had a weird consistency to me. Then the ribs and leek came out. The ribs were amazing. They were tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. The leek was also unique. Finally for dessert we had the crema catalana which was basically a frozen creme brûlée. It was a perfect way to end a wonderful meal.Although the portions were not huge we were both still full. It was great sharing and trying a wide variety of dishes. I honestly liked coming earlier, because it wasn't as crowded yet. By the time we left it was very loud. I know though I will be back as their menu changes monthly!"
"4.0","Finally, decent Mexican food in Pittsburgh! By now, I thought I would never find it but Las Velas is hands down the best I've had in the burgh. Granted, there are a few places I haven't tried yet which are supposed to be good, but for now this one wins!Chips and salsa were good and appeared to be homemade. The margaritas hit the spot, but the Coronas strangely came without limes.I was quite pleased with the chicken burrito verde I ordered, and others in the group enjoyed their tacos al pastor and mole enchiladas. Many of the tables have a nice view of the square, and the only drawback of the whole experience was the service. Unfortunately, our waitress was often absent when we needed something, and I had to chase her down so we could pay our check and leave! From what I could see, the other servers were doing a better job, so this is probably just bad luck.I will definitely come here again!"
"5.0","Mario's is always a go-to bar if you can't decide where to go among the dozens and dozens of other bars in Southside. This place was my Saturday Afternoon hang out for lunch, college football, and 1 dollar Blue Moon drafts. Food wise, typical bar food, I always get the cajun chicken sandwich and the french onion soup and it never disappoints. I give it 5 stars for being a great local bar with a great staff for happy hour or a couple drinks on a weeknight. Friday and Saturday nights are packed with people, which is normal, being a Southside staple, but it might not be for everyone. Especially if you're over 23 and tired of that scene. I can't count how much money I've spent on the Mario's jukebox(s). All and all, I love it."
"5.0","This place is so cute! I came here after walking by it several times. It is the perfect lunch spot - quick, delicious, and cheap! The turkey with bacon on the ciabatta was excellent! And the Sante Fe wrap is also great! It came with a side of soup (I got the chili and it hit the spot) and a drink for $9! I'll definitely be back!"
"1.0","I wouldn't recommend this place to an enemy, very unprofessional , especially for it to be a small family owned business"
"1.0","Rude workers every single time. Tried to become regulars here but the horrible service couldn't make up for the *sometimes* delicious food. Such a shame because there's not many vegan spots in PGH but nowhere is worth eating a meal feeling uncomfortable the whole time. Work on your service! Greet customers, don't give attitude when someone has a question with the menu, just be friendly in general lol I'm not sure how to teach hospitality?!?!"
"4.0","If you are a fan of Indian food then this is the place for you.  The market has a private lot where you are warned to park at your own risk but makes it handy since parking in the Strip district can be a nightmare.On one side is the market where you can purchase all types of meats and canned goods, etc to prepare and Indian style meal. The other side is cafeteria style where you can order meals, salads, gyros, or sandwiches.Since I was having lunch with my son he ordered his favorite which was tandoori chicken and chili chicken. It came with vegetables and an Indian rice platter. I decided to settle for a lamb gyro since there was a sign that stated ' if you are ordering a prepared entree please allow 10 minutes.' This is just a heads up if you are on a lunch hour as my son was. Cards and cash are accepted. If you order a sandwich or gyro then for a slight upcharge you can get French fries and a beverage of choice. You can order as take out as well.First of all portion sizes are enormous! For Indian food yes it is very spicy including the vegetables that caught me by surprise!  The lamb gyro was just okay but I really enjoyed the French fries! My son and I were sharing our dishes and believe me we both ended up taking food home with us.I would recommend that if you come here then as another reviewer noted bypass the gyros and prepared sandwiches and go for the authentic Indian food. Most of these foods are very spicy. However, I must say that you'll never go wrong with their French fries. They are one of the best I have anywhere!"
"5.0","10/10 one of my favorites (if not my favorite restaurant) in Pittsburgh. Food is great. Their Nachos Las Velas is probably my favorite dish. Even though it is an appetizer I get it as my entree and I am good. Their fajitas are also great. Depends on the day their service can be a little wacky but the food makes up for everything."
"3.0","Stopping in around noon on Monday, this place was buzzing! The staff was very friendly and they had a variety of options on the menu. We settled on cups of broccoli cheddar soup and a half turkey sandwich (there is a 1/2 cold sandwich / soup combo deal). The food was fine for a cafe - I would return, but what I had wasn't much different than other cafe's in town. There is extra seating upstairs so even though it was busy, there were seating options.After we had checked out and begun eating we realized the food was either expensive or we were accidentally charged extra. Not concerned enough to ask, but the bill for 2 cups of soup, a half sandwich and two drinks came to $15. (again, might have just been a mistake).I'll stop in again for soup and to see the friendly faces behind the counter!"
"4.0","I have been slowly working through restaurants in the south side that I have not gone to and Stagioni has been on that list for quite some time. When my pregnant cousin had an overwhelming desire for pasta, I knew we should give stagioni a shot. A couple of us girls went one evening for dinner and the waitstaff was pleasant, the food was good and everything was reasonably priced.I resisted my pasta desires and ordered salmon that came with asparagus and an egg sauce. I was so happy that I did! While they do have a small portion option for their pasta dishes (which is amazing) the salmon was cooked perfectly, as were the asparagus, and the egg sauce was soo buttery and delicious. The rest of my party ordered pastas, one a bolognese and the other got a ragu. I did get to try them both and honestly, I preferred my fish. Overall though, it was a really good meal and I'd like to return and try some more dishes!"
"3.0","I had seen this place a few times in Market Square and finally got the chance to stop. I got the Chicago Punch and summer storm. The drinks are strong and very good, presentation is beautiful as well. My friend got an order of fried pickles and said they weren't very good and the music is loud if you are just trying to get a nice dinner. Our server was awesome though! So friendly and welcoming!"
"1.0","I used to live across the street from the original sharp edge, I spent a lot of time, there the food was good and the beer was better. Yesterday I went to the sharp Edge bistro downtown. We were a party of two, we were sat immediately in a booth. There were only about two other tables that were seated, there were some folks at the bar. We looked over the menus looked over the draft list and waited, and waited. Finally I got up and asked if we had a server, after some confusion we finally got a server. I ordered a draft and a burger, my companion ordered a bottled beer and a salad. I ordered my burger medium rare, the server actually came back and asked me again how I wanted the burger done. What I got was a hockey puck. It was brown all the way through, it was dry and terrible.  There was too much bun for the burger. The fries were good. I got a small ramekin of ketchup which used for the burger because it was so dry and dense. I wanted more ketchup, but the server was no where to be found until I was almost done. The beer selection is still very good at the Sharp Edge, I would go back only to sit at the bar and have a beer. Go somewhere else for food."
"5.0","Ok ok ok listen...you all know what you're getting into when you're coming to a bar called the Thirsty Scholar. CHEAP BEER and CHEAP FOOD, however what you didn't know is that the place is HUGE! Great for a group hangout and even better for Saturday/Sunday football! I came here with low expectations and left pleasantly surprised. The scholar is a great place to get away for a few hours to throw back some cold ones and give your brain a break. The bartenders, especially Maggie, were super friendly and recommended the Spicy Parmesan wings for Wednesday's wing night! ($0.70/wing). Oh and did I mention they let you bring your well behaved pup inside the bar!!! Will DEFINITELY be back!"
"5.0","Love the outdoor patio!  Their food is consistently good and it's a great place for a group.  I had the lamb shish and loved it."
"4.0","I haven't been in this place for like 15 years or so and had even forgotten what it was like.  My first impression when I walked in was how clean and well maintained it is for a place that's been around like forever. I had a seat at the bar and was greeted with a smile almost immediately before getting a menu and a raspberry ice tea.I chose the meatloaf sandwich which came with mashed potatoes and roasted veggies. It took less than five minutes to be presented to me and the  whole plate was smothered in a brown gravy.  Everything was truly delicious with the exception of the bread which had a really tough, stale crust.  If I was to order this meal again I would ask them to hold off of the bread and just go with meatloaf and gravy.  Although I was here for lunch,  I should also add that it has great potential for happy hour. There's a full bar and five different craft beers on tap. It looks roomy enough to hold a happy hour crowd too. I give it four stars despite the tough crust.  The service was exceptional, the rest of the meal was delicious and it just seems like a comfortable place to hang out."
"5.0","Love it here! Finally got me out of my Monday blues from working... good environment. Everyone is working and there is good wifi. Not to mention the free smells of the kitchen, yum! The coffee is also great. Smooth and bold, just what I needed to pick me up from the weekend kicking my butt. Happy that I could get pumpkin in my coffee this early as well. I'll definitely be back soon!"
"4.0","Great tacos... or was I influenced by that 2 am feeling?Carnitas are the best, the American are meh..."

"5.0","Several unseasonably sultry evenings ago, as I trekked on foot from my job on 39th Street in Lawrenceville to Altar Bar in the Strip District to catch Iced Earth in concert by my lonesome, I noticed a building bedecked by vibrant colors, and therefore, saw an opportunity to try a restaurant I've passed too many times over the years without stopping in.When I entered, I saw a virtual United Nations in front of me dining in what very much resembled a cafeteria. Black people, brown people, white people, Muslims, Jews, and Libertarian Socialist Semi-Agnostic Caucasian Metalheads (well, at least one) could be seen partaking in Middle Eastern fare...as the Golf Channel (?) was on the telly.The counter was a display of ethnic culinary glory. Pies, rice, proteins, and many spicy, exotic dishes beckoned for my attention, but I didn't want to dally, so I ordered a sandwich. 'Hey, bra, what'll it be?' a man, also bald, with a husky frame, moustache, olive complexion, and accent asked me as if I was an old drinking buddy.'I want the Lamb Shawarma with fries,' I said. 'You been in here before?''Nah, but I've been wantin' to stop in.''You headed somewhere?''Yeah, a concert down at Altar Bar.''Nice, man. This will fill you up. Get a fountain drink, sit down, and I'll take care of you.'And sit down I did, close to the counter so that my new friend wouldn't have to walk that far.Yes, fountain drinks are self-serve here, and there's a 5 minute wait for sandwiches.What arrived in front of me was an Arabic hamburger. The plush pita bread held chunks of a shockingly fresh, abundant, minced, moist, and flavorful lamb that oozed juices and was surrounded by pickles, tomato, lettuce, onion, and...mayo? It certainly didn't taste like the tzatziki I am accustomed to, but therein lied the charm of the sandwich. It was almost as if Salem's wanted something on their menu that would be familiar to Americanized palates, giving the everyday diner a worldly twist on fast food. Also comforting were the golden, battered fries that crackled between my teeth. Not that I am at averse to ethnic food in the least. Regular readers of mine should know that. It's just that I was surprised at how 'American' this shawarma came off and didn't mind at all. In fact, I practically annihilated the shawarma out of its sheer delectability, all while feeling more than welcome in this microcosm of an increasingly diversified city and nation. And for under $10, does one really need to hit up The Clown or The Redhead? After I finished my sandwich, one that was nearly as large as a rolled-up newspaper, I tried to stifle a belch only to get a smile and a nod from one of the employees. 'Man,I knew you'd kill that shawarma,' I heard the man who served me say. I laughed, bid the folks at Salem's farewell, and made my way down to Altar Bar with a satiated stomach and a blissful heart. Note: I was so full, I didn't eat again until 11AM the following morning. That shawarma kept me nourished as I fist-pumped, shouted lyrics, and dodged moshers past midnight in the hot, magnetic concert environs.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGPNeNVAzw"
"4.0","They have thick crust pizza! Since I've moved to Pittsburgh, I've been on the hunt for great think crust pizza ... and now I have two places to go (here and Pizza Perfecta in Shadyside)!I got the Chicago style pizza - which I think was great! I definitely plan on coming back to try their other types of pizza."
"1.0","A mess from top to bottom.We walked in at 8:00.  Slovenly host, slurping on a soda and chewing the ice.  Ten minute wait, but when we were actually seated, most of the tables around us were empty.The place was a mess -- unbussed tables and the nearby bar counter was loaded up with dirty glassware, some of which came crashing down at one point.  Servers were tossing silverware and dishes into a dirty collection area right next to our table.Servers ambled through the place like characters from a slacker movie.  It took about 15 minutes for our server to come to the table and he appeared drunk, slurring his words and couldn't seem to walk straight.Ordered.  Another 15 minutes to get our drinks.The big bowl of green salad came and it was green all right -- practically nothing but iceberg lettuce.The final straw was when two kids sat down at the next table and our server sat down with them.  They were obviously friends and carried on a conversation that would be more appropriate for a gogo bar.Abort.  I found the manager and said we wanted the check.  He had a besieged look on his face and was hardly surprised.  Seemed like he had seen it all before.  He took our drinks off, we paid and left.It's too bad because I love the concept of family-style Italian dining and remember some good meals I had at this place years ago."
"1.0","Wow - I can certainly understand why this establishment will be shutting down soon.  Quite simply, the food was cold, stale, and unappealing.  I stopped here in a hurry, but I really wished I would have reconsidered.  With the many options for food in and around Market Square, keep walking past this place."
"2.0","Morcilla is a restaurant of inconsistent extremes at least for brunch. The food was either very good (champinones a la plancha, Greek salad) or completely meh ( dry manchego biscuits, French press coffee, beet juice) or sounded better on the menu than it tasted like the lamb sausage. I wish Morcilla the best of luck, but on my next visit to Pittsburgh, I'll pass on coming here again."
"4.0","This is as authentic as it can get for a Nepali Cuisine at least in Pittsburgh. As a fellow Nepali and an avid cook myself - I'm pretty confident about my taste bud when it comes to food. Although, this place serves Indian, Chinese and Japanese - I highly recommend anyone who visits this place to go with the Nepali Menu.Although some of the items might share some resemblance with Chinese or the Indian Dish - this is far from the truth. The Nepali dish has a certain uniqueness when it comes to flavor.My highly recommended items on the Nepali Menu would be the Momo(s) either the pan fried or the steamed. They're both home made including the wrapper and the sauce that comes with the Momo is very spicy. So, you might want to request the chef to decrease the amount of spice.The Thali (Rice, Variety of vegetables, Lentils and meat curry of your choice) was very good. However, the amount of curry spice used were a little more than what I wanted.Last but not the least - the price is super reasonable. I'm sure they will raise the price as it's popularity grows but at least for now try all you can."
"3.0","It is really pricey here and for the amount that they charge the food taste just OK so I was not overly blown away"
"3.0","It wouldn't be worth rating another corporate BS place, but, I have to say this location here IS nice to hold meetings at, as it's very large and accomodates many people, who may like to order themselves coffee or sandwiches.  It's right in Oakland, and has a free parking lot in walking distance to a lot of other things that you might want to check out on your way out.As far as the chain itself goes, the bottom line is that Panera is WAY too damn expensive for what you get.  Nothing there is particularly bad, but it's not particularly good either, and certainly not creative. $7 for half of a grilled cheese and a cup of tomato soup?!  Really? No thanks.  Better than star bucks, OK, but kinda on the same lines.  It's Starbucks+.  I wonder if they're owned by the same holding company or something.So, fine for group meetings, but don't go there by yourself or with the significant other."
"4.0","The food is really good. The staff were really courteous. If u go to this place have Kafta kabob. Ull love it."
"5.0","The best Thai I've had in Pittsburgh. Generous portions, reasonably priced. Love the cashew nut stir fry. I wish they delivered but other than that it's pretty much perfect!"
"4.0","Walk into Eadie's Kitchen and Market at 500 Grant Street in downtown Pittsburgh early in the morning, and you'll see attorneys, CPAs, business executive and the like, ordering their breakfasts.  The pace is fast and furious- these are people with a schedule to keep after all, and they want their food to go, in a hurry.  Luckily, the staff at Eadie's Kitchen can keep up; they're used to working in a hurried pace to accommodate breakfast-hungry patrons.Breakfast is a no-brainer.  Order a large pastry, homemade coffee cakes, cinnamon rolls, and other pastries, or eggs any style.  If you want pancakes, or French toast, they have that too.  Lunch is also available at Eadie's Kitchen and Market.  The menu for the week's food is posted on-line for added convenience (eadiescatering.com, then go to 'view the market's weekly specials' section).  For example, the week of March 15th through the 19th, you can look forward to Rotisserie Chicken, Philly Cheese Steaks, Scalloped Potatoes, Cheeseburgers, Greek Feta Salads Fish Sandwiches, and Tuna Casserole (as Lenten specials).  Soup specials include, Crab Bisque, Chicken Noodle, Cream of Mushroom, Wedding, and Tomato Basil.The food at Eadie's Kitchen is good, but there's a secret about this restaurant that many people don't know- they make the best cakes in the city!  I consider myself to be a bit of a pastry connoisseur, and have tried cakes from almost every bakery and pastry shop around- let me tell you, nothing comes close to these delectable desserts.  The cake is moist and flavorful, and the pastry cream is as light as a feather.  Working as a Corporate Chef in the city, I'm responsible for the birthday cakes for our staff and clients.  I would consider making them, but why do that when I can purchase such an exceptional product?  Our favorite cake is the Strawberry Delight; white cake with white icing, with strawberries and strawberry butter cream in between the layers- amazing!  If you're in the market for a birthday cake, or a cake for any other occasion, give Eadie's a try!"
"4.0","We went there on our visit to Pittsburgh. We heard a lot of praises for this place and decided to visit. The food was good. We ordered beef Sichuan, sweet and sour chicken. They also give a chicken roll with the food which was out this world delicious. All the food comes with either plain white rice or fried rice."
"4.0","I work in the USX tower, love having the old school for breakfast. Tacos are great in the summer, nachos are good too. The staff is very friendly and fun too."
"4.0","It's good to see this authentic made-your-own style malatang in Pittsburgh! Hunan Bar has something in this nature, but the items in each serving are fixed so less flexibility.Nothing very glamorous about the veggie selections, but I have to give a shout out to the meat selections. All sorts of fish balls and meat balls. Meat, eggs, and FRESH SHRIMP!!! I mean I hate to say this but a lot of shrimps I ate in Pittsburgh had been frozen for a century and tasted like rubber rather than sea food. I took a star off because of the pricing. $0.9 per ounce doesn't sound like a lot but wait until you see your final price. Mine costs $18 and it didn't feel like a lot. Oops. But I guess it also depends on what you get. My friend spent $9 and she didn't leave hungry. Hmmm so maybe next time I'll need to order strategically."
"5.0","One of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh right now. The food is delicious. You feel like you're eating food cooked at someone's house and not mass produced in a restaurant.The momos are excellent. I'm just really glad that I found a restaurant where they serve delicious momos in Pittsburgh. I've been to Subba twice and one of the times I just ordered a plate of momos as my main course (they're listed as starters).Which brings me to the price. Everything is really cheap and the quantity is huge (not to mention delicious!). The restaurant itself is in an older building and the entrance makes it look like a hole in the wall, but don't be fooled by that! I've been recommending this place to every person I've met since and I've been there twice in a week even though it's a bit of a drive from where I live."
"4.0","Cool little taco spot. Pretty small place, but it has a nice vibe. A lot of people were getting take out, but we got a couple of the seats in the place. Ordered 4 tacos and the nachos (pretty good helping) for my wife and I, and we got out of their for just about $20. Tacos were pretty solid. Nothing to write home about it, but enough to make you happy. Both ordered the Pork which comes with enough toppings to possibly only need one. The nachos were dope though, covered in cheese, sour cream, pico, and jalapeños. Definitely wouldn't mine going back the next time I'm in Pittsburgh."
"5.0","Such a random pick (based on Yelp reviews!!). Don't be fooled by the outdated aesthetic, this was one of the best meals I've had in ages!!! Fresh ingredients made fresh to order. DELICIOUS!!"
"5.0","All I have to say is GRILLED CHEESE! They are so Yummy. I had one with Pierogies in it which was amazing. It's large so you will definitely take some to go and all grilled cheeses come with chips and a tomato soup to dip. Also, big highlight they take reservations!"
"4.0","I was here with a friend a few days ago for dinner around 6:30. I had never gone and wanted to check it out at some point because I'd always heard generally favorable reviews. There were a few people waiting in the foyer and the waiter told us it would be a 20-25min wait. The thing I found most peculiar though was that there were clearly at least 2 other tables that would seat two available in the dining room. When we asked about this, we were told there were people ahead of us waiting for a table. That makes sense, but I could see the other parties of two weren't being seated either. After waiting for half an hour we were about to leave but a waiter called us back and asked us to wait a bit longer, offering a free appetizer for our patience. Eventually we were seated and I realized they were waiting to seat the party of 3 ahead of us at a bigger table. I'm still a little confused about the need to have us wait for them to be seated first because they had a larger group that wouldn't fit at one of the small tables. So although we arrived after them, I'm sure they would have understood that parties of 2 could be seated earlier. I'm not sure if I'm missing something here but generally I think it makes sense to seat based on capacity and not strictly order. Anyway, I ended up ordering the Chicken Korma and the quality was excellent. This and the free appetizer was enough to make me forget my prior displeasure concerning the long wait for being seated and getting food."
"1.0","5:15 reservation they sat us at 6:15. We were six people who were sat at a four top. My chair was touching the chair of the person behind me so no one could get by. The waiter asked me to get up and move so he could get by, what???  So when I sat sideways against the wall (due to no moving room) he said thank you. Not okay. There was an elderly man who needed a seat and went roaming into the coat room in desperation for a chair because he was standing for 30 minutes waiting for a table that he made a reservation for. No one noticed so I went into the coat room myself (as a customer) to bring him a chair so he didn't fall down. After asking ourselves to be sat at a table where we weren't being hit by customers and waiters, we were moved to a regular table. Then our food was an hour late because the kitchen 'made a mistake' on roasted chicken. (?)If you want an anxiety free calm place that gives attention to comfort, this restaurant may not be for you."
"5.0","We loved this place! The service was excellent. We made a reservation in advance so no wait. I tried 4 of their house beers all of which were decent, 2 I liked more than others including the dad beer. We had the buffalo chicken rillettes which were different and very tasty. Then we had the crab grilled cheese with tomato soup and the haluski with kilbasa which we passed around. Both were very rich and filling but totally worth it. Overall a great spot with great service and yummy food."
"5.0","I wanted to give an update. I had a hold on my card for about $23.27 from when I dined there with my fiancé & his boss with her boyfriend on 5/30/14. Hold remained for over a week. I called & initially spoke to a manager & after a week passed called again but this time I spoke to the general manager. The GM was a really nice man, he was to the point & quick to fix the problem. The hold was removed shortly after we spoke.I can that the GM was not only polite but very apologic & was very quick to fix the problem. My fiancé & I enjoy this place & was really glad that they took care of the issue efficiently/effectively. We'll be back again soon. *Beware of those tasty moscow mules! lol*"
"1.0","Ordered the special chicken biryani....the spice level was unbearable..... Could not survive more than 2 bites.... The server should not warn people that this might be their last meal...... Lost faith in Biryanis"
"5.0","Have wandered by Edgar's a few times but never went in until today. Now upset I never went in.  Had 2 steak tacos and they were delicious. The meat was great and the freshness of the vegetables and salsa took it to the next level."
"4.0","Abstract: Great breakfast, okay coffee, awesome people.Breakfast: +1.5I go back for the bacon, egg, and cheese on a bagel. They are hand made to order, and made well. With real eggs, kids. The pastries and donuts look really good, too. Psh, like I didn't get a donut. I always upvote donuts. Coffee: +.5Plainly said, the over-roasted coffee is nothing to write home about, but it's WAY better than anything else on the Mount. They offer perfectly drinkable, auto-drip coffee at fair prices. Atmosphere: +2It's casual, relaxed, and the perfect amount of kitschy. Here, you can add cream & sugar if you want without being judged. This is refreshing if you frequent swank pour-over bars... like the one in the strip that will remain unnamed... that used to be on 21st Street... They lectured my mom. I digress.So... the breakfast sammies are sound and it's super chill, but I'm not crazy about the coffee. It sounds pretty average; why the fourth star? The people make it. It's a great little neighborhood shop, and an asset to the area. Even an insufferable introvert like me can stop in and enjoy a chat with the über-friendly staff while I wait for my bacon to crisp on the flatiron."
"4.0","They have greatly improved the tea selection by coming up with inventive house blends. Lavender Lemonade was perfect and not too sweet on a VERY HOT day, the hot ginger blast with lemon was great on a chilly day. Great addition to the community."
"5.0","Never disappointed here! Always consistently delicious salads with a friendly and efficient staff, especially during the crazy lunchtime rush."
"1.0","Attempted to stop in on a Sunday afternoon. Was told there was an hour wait (5 of us in the group). There were numerous empty tables. I've been to Sharp Edge on several occasions before and I can assure you the food isn't worth waiting an hour for. We were the second group to immediately turn around and leave."
"4.0","This place was great! We had several different dishes, but the chorizo hash was the winner. Expect a bit of a wait, but it's worth it."
"5.0","Simple pizza, nothing too fancy. But the slices are HUGE! A friend recommended that we get a slice to share, but that sounded weird to me so we got our own slices, and MY WORD, was I wrong. One slice is equivalent to 3 normal slices. They make whole pizzas that's can't fit through the door. A slice of cheese pizza is only $4 & is VERY filling. I'm sure I'll be back at some point if I'm in Southside."
"4.0","Pizza is great, but a little on the salty side. However, it is one of the slower delivery services we use for Shadyside.Delivery was recently 20 minutes late on a day in the middle of the week and the guy on the phone was quite rude about it. Apparently, only 'John' is capable of helping to resolve issues; you'd have to call back when he is working."
"4.0","This place is every college student's dream: cheap, large portion and right on campus! And the service is fast and efficient. I always get my usual: a samosa and a large order of chicken makhani over white rice. Chicken makhani is my favorite and I highly recommend if you like creamy sauces! Also you have the option of a small or large order. I would get a large because for just a dollar more, you get twice the amount of food, enough for lunch and dinner!"
"2.0","Received a two star because the food was excellent, but host staff is horrible.  Was visiting from out of town and thought it would be nice to visit the north shore for the Game since I've never been there before.  I have been in the food serviceIndustry and have never seen such poorly trained Manager or Host staff. Went there on game day and put my name on the list.  After waiting for 1.5hrs I asked hostess where my name was on the list and they said they called my cell phone and i didn't answer.  I showed the hostess my cell phone log and showed her that I had NOT missed any calls, and NO calls from any numbers in PGH.  She insisted she called me and there was nothing more she could do.  There was a guy standing there and I asked him if I could talk to a manager and he said he would get one.  He left and returned and said there weren't any managers present and he couldn't find one.  BTW, while I was standing there a girl came up and said she had two missed call and showed them her phone log and they told her we gave your table away for not answering.    I asked the gentleman his name and he refused to give it to me, and said I was out of luck on getting a seat.  I asked for the manager again and voices started to elevate and he asked me to step outside so we could settle it the  old fashioned way with a fight...  Now I'm asking him, are you really threatening me because you don't want to find your manager???   Fortunately there was a patron behind me who heard the whole thing, asked if I needed a manager and left and returned in less than a minute with one.   The manager did not seem concerned that her server just threatened me and wanted to go outside, nor did she seem concerned over how the other hostesses said they called me when I didn't have any missed calls and perfectly good cell signal.  Her only comment to me was it was game day and it happens.   I have worked major Events my whole life and know the planning associated with it and can relate, but again making this statement is not fixing the problem or addressing the issue with the staff.   Fortunately as we were going through these issues another gentleman walked by and said I have your seat follow me.   Not sure why the manager or all the other staff are so poorly trained.   If They are going to use cell phones as the only source to commiunicate a seating they need to be prepared to address issues when they are wrong and accidentally cross a name offThe list without contacting them.The waiter we had was excellent and food was excellent, but this incident soured the whole experience"
"4.0","Sienna Mercato's Il Tetto is Open: Let's Shout It From the Rooftop!I am infatuated with delicious eats, but I'm a sucker for ambience.  Find me a place that has both, and I will be your number one customer.  I'm excited to say that the visionaries behind Sienna Mercato are now two for two with the recent opening of Il Tetto.  Now you have the mother of all dilemmas.  Will you get your meatball on at Emporio (located on the first floor) before or after you take the elevator ride to Il Tetto's gorgeous rooftop beer garden? As some of you know I've been anticipating the opening of Il Tetto for some time.  As the cosmos would have it, their second night in operation just happened to be my birthday.  No lie, I was a tad nervous bringing my band of friends to a locale I had never been before, but the idea of a spacious rooftop bar in downtown was just too darn tempting to pass up.  My imagination had nothing on this place.  Upon exiting the elevator, my jaw dropped a bit.  The rain had stayed at bay, allowing the retractable glass ceiling to reveal a portion of the city's skyline and a pleasant nighttime breeze.  Seating options varied from cozy nooks to sizable party tables.  The bar, which lined an entire stretch of wall, was inviting as well.  No matter where you sit, be sure to look up and admire the gas lamps and charming strings of lights.  The décor is pleasing to most anyone I'd wager, from sports fans (there were several TVs playing the Buccos game) to those seeking a romantic rendezvous and anyone in between.  So, Il Tetto is picturesque, you get it.  But looks will only get you so far (as my grandma loved to remind me when I'd get 'gussied up.')  I needed to get my hands on a birthday libation.  Lucky for me, the draft list is equally as impressive as Emporio's.  The reason?  Each of the 32 drafts that are downstairs are piped up to Il Tetto's bar.  You can also imbibe on wine and specialty cocktails if you prefer. In regards to food, the menu provides a select list of small plates ranging from munchies like house-made Pork Rinds to heavier dishes like the Duck Confit Steak Fries.  We ordered the latter.  The fries were crisp, yet tender and the duck fat gravy added a velvety richness to the plentiful shreds of duck meat.  The topping of a sunny side-up egg added yet another level of richness and texture.  In other words, it was...To read my full review and check out delicious food pics, please visit: http://fork2mouth.blogspot.com/2014/05/sienna-mercatos-il-tetto-is-open-lets.html"
"3.0","I can only speak for the takeout. I ordered while staying in a nearby hotel on business and was hungry after a long day and a run outside afterwards. It was average but considering it cost $28 for chicken Parmesan with a third-party ordering system I was not too impressed because the quality was just average. I asked for spaghetti with my chicken Parm but I received a penne and the sauce was just tossed on top of bare pasta so I had to mix it up when I received it.  I am glad I also asked for crush read and Parmesan cheese because the marinara sauce was very bland similar to Classico tomato sauce out of the jar. I wonder how the other dishes are but likely wouldn't reorder again."
"5.0","It's a must try for anyone in the area. The food is great, and Try their beer slushies for a refreshing beverage. It's a very intimate yet casual atmosphere."
"3.0","Half of Mitchell's is a bar and the other half is a family friendly diner. I'm not sure how the bar side is, but the diner portion is lovely. The atmosphere is very warm and bright. I really appreciate it when a restaurant has proper lighting and kudos to Mitchell's for providing that. I came here around the holiday season and it was all decorated. The service was quick and wonderful. Our waitress was a sweetheart. My only complaint is the cigarette smoke leaking in from the bar side. As for food, I got to try the chili, Mitchburger and original fish sandwich. The best entrée on the table was the burger. It was packed with flavors and bacon. I wish they allowed the option to request it medium rare, instead of coming out fully cooked. The chili was a bit bland, even though thick with meat. I suggest adding a pinch of Cajun and a pinch of salt then it'll be perfect. The fish sandwich was HUGE, but came with nothing except two buns. I suggest slapping on some sauce and dress it up with lettuce/tomatoes. It was so dried without any sauce and plain old ketchup just doesn't cut it. Add a special house blend sauce that's creamy with a spicy kick, then that'll be 5-stars worthy. Although there were minor flaws in the food, I see potential in this place and would love to return here in the future if I'm in the area. Portions are huge with tons of meat and prices very affordable for the amount of food."
"5.0","Excellent, amazing, wonderful and any other adjective you can use to describe greatness.. been there tons of times and it's always the same. Great tacos!! The chef is talkative, the atmosphere is upbeat and best tacos in Pittsburgh.. thank you Doce Tagueria!!"
"5.0","First time visit with friends. Great value for $20 brunch specials! Delicious food and casual cozy atmosphere added up to a good time with friends. Highly recommended. Next time we will try seating at the back patio in warm weather."
"5.0","This is hands down my favorite vegan/vegetarian restaurant in Pittsburgh. We originally came here to try the latkes but ended up also getting the thick cut avocado toast, red lentil soup, and the seitan schwarma. The latkes weren't bad but nothing to rave about; however, I highly recommend the the avocado toast. They use a thick cut fluffy white bread and cover it in a hefty portion of avocado; on top they drizzle it in dark sesame and tahini sauce. I'd never had a soup like the red lentil soup but it's now one of my favorites. It's a broth based yellow soup with a good portion of lentils. The hint of lemon and herbs also gives it a great punch of freshness. The seitan schwarma was refreshing. I'm not a vegan or vegetarian by any means but I find seitan to be delicious. I'm a big fan of pickled everything so the pickled raddish(I believe) is wonderful. Their tzatziki sauce was also really flavorful. We've been back here many times and we've never had a bad experience."
"5.0","I haven't had a dish yet that I would call anything less than perfection. The roasted cauliflower is superb, the baba ganoush is truly tasty, the service is absolutely top notch. This is the best crew in the city; a well-oiled service machine. Book a table and bring an empty stomach. I can't decide what to have next."
"4.0","The pie crust was nice and thin. The onions cut just perfectly and the sausage crumbled well.The hot Italian sausage hoagie was delicious !"
"3.0","Ok. Average Chinese at best. Was expecting better based on the yelp reviews. Chicken schzwan was mild and bland. Would not likely go back."
"2.0","Very overrated and over-priced. Ordered a standard cocktail that was watered down and tasteless. The fish we ordered that night was very under-flavored and dry. The appetizer was fussy and pretentious but was essentially a dressed up salad. The waiter seemed to be trying her best, but the quality of the food was very disappointing, especially for the price. Seems the price tag is for the buzz and the hype rather than the quality of the meal."
"5.0","Great for date night, one of our favorite restaurants in PGH. Their service, food, byob policy is all fantastic! However, forewarning that the kitchen cant handle large groups."
"5.0","One of the best meals in Pittsburgh hands down. The service was excellent and the food was amazing. We started off with the bruschetta that was topped with bacon and tons of veggies the split the pork rassito(spelling) and split the eggplant pizza. I was shocked how delicious the eggplant pizza was, it was very good. The price of the food was very reasonable about 15-20 bucks a plate. The wine bottles were overpriced at 50 so we went with a glass of wine at 10 instead. I would highly recommend this place"
"4.0","Great bar for a few hours of work as a solo business traveller. Everyone really friendly and not pushy at all. Food was good, but 'small' plates are enormous."
"4.0","I visited Umami when I first moved to Pittsburgh.  While the restaurant gave a fun izakaya vibe, I thought some of the food items were lacking.  I recently visited (a whole year late) and had a better experience.One of the things I like about Umami is the late Friday and Saturday hours.  The restaurant itself is compact, nested on the third floor where Cantina is.  The entrance is on the side street though.  It was a bit hard to find it during the evening.  It's almost like a izakaya speakeasy! I like what their drink menu offers.  The specialty drinks are well-priced and easy to drink.  Another thing I like about Umami is the serving size.  It's not one of those restaurants where my stomach cries over how small the portions are.  For a party of two, their appetizer size are pretty big to share.This time, we ordered the chawan mushi, chirashi, tonkotsu ramen, and some handrolls.  I did not like the tonkotsu ramen a year ago.  The bamboo shoot was overpowering the broth.  The broth in tonkotsu ramen is key, and they didn't deliver it.  Since Umami owner is a co-founder of Ki Ramen, I figured to give the ramen a try again.  I LOVE THE TONKOTSU RAMEN THIS TIME AROUND!  The broth isn't very salty but fatty enough.  My favorite part was the bone in cha siu.  I'd come back to Umami for that alone.  The chirashi has a beautiful presentation and good quality fish.  The handrolls were decent, but a little pricier and not much different than other places.  The chawan mushi egg was silky and smooth.  I'd love to come back and try the rest of the menu next time.  Now that I discovered some stand out items, it makes me want to revisit."
"4.0","I had the pleasure of eating at Sausalido during restaurant week. From their pre fix menu, I ordered the Sicilian meatballs, mixed greens salad, and roasted kale risotto. For the amount and quality of food that I got, the $25.14 dinner was definitely worth it. Since Sausalido proclaims itself as an Italian restaurant, I wanted to try their version of a risotto. I do not know if restaurants are starting to this recently, but  I could tell that the rice in the risotto had been par-cooked and then added to the sauce. I do understand that it is time-consuming to make risotto but I was disappointed that an Italian restaurant would take this shortcut. Overall, I would definitely go back to Sausalido and try their other dishes."
"5.0","A Pittsburgh institution! Delicious breakfast, fabulous service, a must do! If there's a wait-trust me it's so worth it! Go for the chocolate chip banana pancakes."
"4.0","Very good sushi for a shopping mall. A little pricey for the location. Good selection but the platters save some money. Worth a re-visit."
"2.0","The service started off great! I sat at the bar and felt like the sever was going to be on point. I order a starter. The starter shrimp fritters came out really fast and was really tasty. The bar tender came back and still was very attentive. I asked some questions about the drink and settled for the most expensive drink on the menu related to cocktails. I waited for him to come back for a few moments and ordered a pizza. It took the pizza around 15 mins to come out and as I am sitting there watching him make drinks hoping mine was coming. It never came, the pizza came, I ate and was never checked on again the rest of my visit. The pizza was good and I know your thinking why did I not say anything. The bar is rather different and you don't sit in-front of the bar tender, he passed behind me several times and refused to make eye contact. My water was empty and I had to almost grab him to get a refill. He never came back, I had to walk up to him to get my ticket. The restaurant was busy when I arrived and started to empty as I was there. So it's hard to understand why he was not more attentive to his guest. My $14 drink never came, the business lost revenue. I am pretty sure them manager was walking behind me the entire time as well, saw me looking around and never checked on me once. I visit here often, love to try all the cool food places every trip. This was a poor experience and I may never return. Beware."
"5.0","Wow this place is delicious, and a warm atmosphere. Both of our bowls were so good; I had the curry and it was just spicy enough, boyfriend had the shoyo and it was perfect. They have warm sake, too."
"3.0","Shocking experience...My husband and I along with another couple went for dinner on a Sunday night. Our server came to our table and explained the menu. We all decided to have the 4 coarse family style dinner. We also ordered a bottle of wine (750 ml) and 1 glass of sangria. The food came out in stages and was properly timed and was very good. But then thing took a turn for the worst. While we were beginning to eat our 3rd coarse we asked for a second bottle of wine (750 ml) and another glass of sangria and servers response was they could not serve our table anymore alcohol and that water would be a good choice. My husband are in our mid fifties and the other couple are in their late thirties, and are complete capable of knowing our limits. Then we were met by the manager who insinuated that we have had enough alcohol and it would be a risk for him to serve us anymore. At this point we couldn't enjoy the rest of our experience and ask for our check. I have never in my life been so humiliated. We visit Pittsburg on a regular basis and we will never dine at this establishment again!!!"
"4.0","I often say, you can can measure the greatness of a restaurant if you keep going back because you're craving the cuisine.  For me, Kassab's is certainly one of these places.  Unfortunately, because I have fallen in love with a selection of the dishes, we always end up ordering some combination of the following : Dolmeh (with meat), Spicy Chicken (really spicy!), Kafta, or Shawarma sandwiches, Lamb kabob (grilled to a medium rare perfection and served with almond rice and smokey grilled onion), Spinach pie (like spanikopita).  So, I have yet to venture off of these staples and continue to try new items! Another favorite: the house dressing; it's a yogurty sauce spiced with garlic and lemon juice- maybe their house tahini?  Whatever the ingredients, this tangy  concoction is amazing!  The restaurant itself is small, and we have never needed to make reservations (both pluses in my book, especially when I'm needing to satisfy a craving!)  Of course, one of the other attractive qualities of Kassab's is that it's BYOB, and there's no corkage fee! I absolutely love this place, and will definitely be going back for more  :)"
"1.0","I cant recommend this place to anyone since the food is prepared by amateur cooks who dont mind serving leftovers for the next day nor are they very aware and acquanited with food safety handling regulations. The thing that caused a friend of mine to get food poising and diahrrea after ordering a kefta sandwitch. Not ordering from there again! And we reallly missed the previous owner 'Salems halal' who moved to the strip district."
"4.0","Awesome low-key atmosphere for excellent Ramen! Dan Dan Ramen is so good for the cured tofu fan and adding chili paste or a dippy egg is the way to go! Interesting beer and wine list that is unique and different! Their apps include pig ears, delicious buns, and great specials nightly! Awesome place in Lawrenceville! Check it out!"
"5.0","Outstanding new restaurant with creative fresh, beautifully presented and not heavy food. Service was the best. Will return soon.Steve"
"2.0","We ordered  16 slice pizza with pepperoni, red onion and green peppers topping.  Maybe two slices of pepperoni, hardly any green pepper and could not find any red onion.  Such a disappointment.  Will go back to making my own pizza."
"4.0","An easy spot to miss in Market Square, but sooo good! I tried it out at lunch time. Come early because this place loads up around noon. I had the lunch special veggie tacos Mexican style (topped with cilantro and onion) - very good! My group shared the dip trip (queso, salsa, guacamole) which was fantastic - I wish they'd give more chips as we ran out, but were left with so much dip. Seems like it would be a great happy hour spot. Loved the interior look and feel and has a view overlooking the square since you're up on the second floor. I will return!"
"3.0","My wife and I chose Coca Cafe for our brunch outing this month and our experience was very similar to the other reviews of this establishment. This place needs an operational overhaul! Everything took forever from the checking in, to the ordering, to the time it took to get the drinks and food. When you walk in there is no indication of where you should go to check in and give your name. The counter looks to be more of a server station than where you go to give your name. We stood there unclear with no one really saying anything as they frantically ran around. Eventually three people came to say something at the same time. Once seated and with our drinks and starter ordered, it just seemed to take forever for everything to happen. 10-15 mins for our mimosa and coffee beverage to arrive than another 10-15 mins for the donut holes to come. There were 3 on the plate and looked delicious. They were not. It was like having chocolate flavored charcoal. They were hard as rocks and tasted burnt. We didn't eat the third one and thankfully they removed it from the bill. A little over an hour after we were seated our food finally arrived. We shared the sourdough french toast and the club Eggs Benedict. Both were very tasty and by themselves would have gotten 4/5 stars, though the poached egg was definitely overcooked and not at all runny like it should have been. Once finished we were told we could checkout at the counter when we were ready, but we were never given an itemized check with the total prior to going to the counter. Then at the register, I was simply told what the total was and asked if I wanted to put a tip on the card. I never received any receipt.If I lived in the neighborhood and could walk to this place, I might return. Big 'might'. Given that I live about 20 minutes away, I don't think I will be returning and I wouldn't really recommend anyone to go out of their way to go here. We had brunch at Bar Marco last month, paid the same prices and had much better ambiance and service."
"1.0","This is what food poisoning looks like, had one piece of veal out of the three. I've had Marsala dishes hundreds of time, have made it myself and this is the worst Marsala meal I've ever had. It didn't taste like Marsala at all all I tasted was oil, as you can see in the pictures attached. They took off this one dish from my portion of the bill, but that doesn't help me with food poisoning... or the ruined night."
"4.0","Yay!!! A Bloomfield restaurant that doesn't make you want to cut your tongue out. Since Stagioni left, the fine'ish dinning scene has staggered in Bloomfield...but not no mo.Station has great staff and ambiance that has a real rust belt feel, that's less rusty.Looking at the menu, and the space, I felt they might hand me a bow and arrow to eat with. We had the Venison, the crispy wings, beef tongue toast and burger. Wow, the venison was clean and the flavors and textures gel'd...it was amazing. So was the beef tongue toast, what a flavor, and again, textures that made you just keep coming back.The wings where solid and 'crispy' was no joke. A brilliant plate.The burger has issues. A bit dry. A bit bland. The cheese did not work.The staff was on point, and the bar had serious cocktails and beers.Can't wait to go back."
"4.0","The coffee is reason enough. I don't know what vegan crack they put it in, but from the specialty coffee to the basic, it was all perfection. In addition, I sampled the Chai tea and it too was delicious.  The food...not bad. I'm not vegan but I often eat foods from this genre. I've had better, and I've had worse. The pancakes were pretty good and the Seitan/Tofu Scramble was decent as well. Skip the sausage - no one at the table was a fan. I'm not sure I'll be frequently B52 for the food, but for you vegans out there, I'm sure it's a great option. The service was also on point, and that goes a long way. Enjoy!"
"5.0","We came here to celebrate mine and my fathers birthday! We had a birthday coupon and free birthday sundae! The restaurant has such fun photos on the wall, it is a very unique atmosphere. Staff was very friendly and our server was super helpful in deciding what to choose for dinner. We went with the baked ziti and also ordered 3 meatballs-the ziti with ricotta on top was delicious! Talk about a carb attack. Worth it! The large portion is said to feed 5 but it could definitely feed up to 7 people in my opinion. They also give you complimentary bread and oil which was also super tasty. The brownie sundae was huge and four of us split it. It tasted alright. I can say we weren't too thrilled with how hard and dry the brownies were, so I wouldn't order that as a dessert again in the future, but it was free so that was nice. They also sing a funny birthday song to you and bring out a large candle which was cool! We would definitely return in the future."
"5.0","Had some great vegetarian tacos ( hard to find good ones with fake meat). The tacos were very well seasoned. Had a vegetarian burrito as well, which again were very fresh and well seasoned. Would definitely come back."
"4.0","You have to go into your night at Girasole understanding that reservations may not matter, you could be waiting 20-45 minutes for a table, and you'll probably be sitting at a tiny crammed table right next to another group, but it's all worth it if you appreciate genuine Italian food. I had the special, bucatini all'amatriciana, which was fabulous and you could tell the noodles were homemade! Bruschetta, rose, and fresh table bread were all delicious. Only basic thing was the Penne with chicken, nothing special and could be made at home.Overall one of our favorite easy Italian places in PGH"
"1.0","I had lunch buffet which is about $10. There were some food to get but they don't have distinguishing tastes. For example, in my picture, can you tell that I get a little bit of everything from the buffet? Moreover, they tasted the same....I don't recall it tasty or worthy at all. When you pay upfront in the desk, they use a iPad thing to process the payment and they literally stare at you and your movement when you make to the 'tip' section. It really feels uncomfortable and somewhat 'forcing you to pick the high tip' even though it is a buffet and I barely got any service."
"5.0","I think these are my new favorite macarons!I work next door and have been low key avoiding this place because I've heard how wonderful the place is and I'm always trying (failing) to avoid bread. Anyway, a friend and I were having a rough day at work and she suggested we stop in and grab something small so I obliged and I'm now addicted to their macarons. The quality is absolutely in the ingredients here folks."
"4.0","We made reservations to come here for brunch on a Sunday afternoon.  Looking on their website (Which was down for maintenance) and on the Yelp site we couldn't find any brunch menus.  Only lunch.  We just figured they probably have a brunch menu special that changes week to week.   We parked at a lot nearby and walked in.  Our table was ready and it was busy in there.  There was a festival going on near by so a lot of people were around in the Strip.  We sat down and our waitress gave us their menus and she went over verbally their brunch menu for the day.  I was almost set with going with one of their fish sandwiches but she described a French toast with ice cream that seemed delicious but just too sweet for me at this time of the day.  The other option I liked was Chorizo tacos and I added a side of fries because I was hungry.  My wife was in between a few choices too like their Lobster Roll or the Salmon scrambled eggs. She went with the Salmon.  She did order a Bloody Mary to go with her brunch too.  I just had water. Our food came out within 15 minutes and it all looked good.  My tacos were really tasty.  I received 2 tacos and I could have eaten three.  That's why I ordered a side of fries.  The fries were disappointing.  I know this is a fish place but I still expected decent fries.  My fries were not seasoned, they just came out plain and they were $4.  I didn't like that.  I put S&P on them to make them better but they weren't worth $4.  My wife liked her Salmon and eggs. I think she really would have preferred the Lobster Roll but she let me eat some of her eggs and they were really good.  I actually liked it better than my tacos. We liked this place and would visit here again to try out their lunch and entrée menu's.  The atmospheres good and the people were friendly.  My only complaint was those $4 plain fries!"
"5.0","Nothing better than a solid vegan experience. Nicely done.  Loved the tacos and hipster vibe"
"4.0","I've been here a couple times now. While the atmosphere and space is great, the menu has been hit or miss. The miso eggplant was a hard pass. Honestly looked like a Dead Sea animal slathered in topping. It was sliced but not all the way through which made it next to impossible to eat with chopsticks. We pretty much had to fight to tear it to pieces. The taste wasn't bad but the longer I looked at it, the harder it was to eat. My partner really enjoyed the Inferno Ramen. Definitely high on the spicy scale, which we love. The noodle texture is slightly gummy, if you care about that. The Miso Ramen left a lot to be desired. The Curry Ramen on the other hand, is great. By far my favorite. I come back specifically for that.    The nitamago egg was absolutely amazing. Overall excited to see what is to come from this place!"
"3.0","Good food but on the pricy side. It's the Best Chinese restaurant around downtown."
"4.0","Came here for lunch while on a visit to the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, which is just steps away. We ordered off the lunch menu which included an entree, salad, rice and fresh naan. Food came out very fast and the staff was very polite/accommodating. This isn't the best Indian I've had, but the food was pretty tasty, especially the naan. Everyone in my family enjoyed it even my sometimes picky kids. To top off the off the experience, my five year old was proudly telling everyone it was his birthday and then they surprised us by serving him a complimentary slice of Oreo cheesecake!"
"4.0","As a family we have always loved Buca Di Beppo at any location. The food is great, the service has always been excellent, however, the wait time for food delivery and the final bill, keeps us remembering why we come and will we return.   Over all the experience of Buca Di Beppo is wonderful !! We love the family style dining and have made reservations for years for all occasions. The price isn't bad for what you receive as well as discounts and coupons are everywhere if you look for them. I know with all this being said we as a family will return."
"4.0","The food here really exceeded my expectations. I came for brunch and got the eggs Benedict with homemade salmon cake. The cake was perfectly flaky and the presentation was on point. My friend got the the smoked beef brisket hash. She really liked it, but I felt it was a little too smokey for my taste. Also there were two talented performers playing acoustic guitar and singing. A great addition to a lazy Sunday morning. I will back on taco Tuesday."
"4.0","This place has been around forever!  The best deal in town is the lamb shank dinner - it's so tender -cooked to perfection plus it's a huge portion.  It used to be BYOB here but now they have their own bar - you can still bring your own but they charge you for it.  It's been a while since I've been here (and I used to come here all the time) so I forgot how much I love the lamb, schwarma and falafel.   I'm sure I'll be back!!"
"4.0","Great pizza and late night weekend specials. Walk in X-Large pizza for $6. $1 toppings is also an excellent price with the deal. If you are in a pizza mood in Oakland, Sorrento's is one of the best available at a wonderful price."
"5.0","i was so excited to try out an impossible burger as i've been vegetarian for a few years and vegan for the last year. i gotta be honest, i couldn't eat much of it because it tasted too much like meat (it almost made me sick tbh) but my sister tried it and liked it, and the fries were amazing! our server keith was super friendly and attentive!"
"5.0","Great neighborhood place! We've been twice now and both times were absolutely delicious. Great for groups or just for some snacks and drinks. On our last visit, we had an asparagus salad with green goddess ramp dressing that I'm still thinking about!"
"3.0","3.5 starsAlways fun to have a fresh place open up.This place is clearly targeted towards college students (dance party songs, swarmed with college vibes), and they chose a prime location to put this place. The chikn spices are weird---as many people have found out, medium is usually like a upper to comfortable to spicy eaters, but hot starts to kill people and I don't even want to think about the extra hot. Other than that, sandwiches are generous with thick slices of chicken, and I'd say the bread and garnishes are a step up from chikfila."
"5.0","Fantastic little place with delicious comfort food - something different every day. Everything I have tried so far has been fabulous, from the wagyu smoked brisket sandwiches to the housemade fudges and wide array of housemade barbecue sauces, and an amazing plate of Schnitzel  with spaetzle halusky (really good), carrots and gravy. I am looking forward to many more visits!"
"2.0","The space itself is beautiful, but that doesn't mean much if the food is lackluster. And, oh boy, is it ever lackluster! The star of the show--the ramen--is tasteless and bland, served lukewarm by an Eeyore of a waiter who seems deflated by the mere presence of customers. The broth lacks richness, the noodles lack bite, the meat is flavorless. . .it's like they took everything that's supposed to be good about a piping hot bowl of well-made ramen and threw it out the window. I was never a fan of Umami's ramen, but I thought that maybe with the spotlight on one dish, things might improve. That hasn't happened. I just don't get it. It doesn't help to try and gussy something up with fancy add-ins if the fundamental building blocks are terrible.It's my sincere hope that someday Pittsburgh will get an authentic ramen place without a lot of bells and whistles, because guess what? If done properly, ramen doesn't need much window dressing. If an actual ramen restaurant ever opens here, god help these places popping up that are all swagger and no substance."
"5.0","Ok, ok,ok, I came back. I've decided to put the last encounter there behind me. While I'm still not pleased about it. This last visit is exactly what I expected from this business. Seeing the google offer for Las Velas and having it literally right next door to work was too good to pass up. Not to mention the offer IS good for alcohol as well as food anytime after 4pm, INCLUDING happy hour. It doesn't get any better than that. As soon as I walked up to the bar I was greeted by not one but TWO employees. I had a water while I waited for happy hour to start. The waitstaff stands next to the end of the bar where I was sitting while waiting for tables and drink orders to be completed. Small talk was made and it was pleasant.The margaritas were strong as always. The air was light and cheerful. None of the anxiety driven rush rush rush of my last visit. We had cheese with salsa and fresh made guac. They were a great addition to the drinks. We got so much for the 30$ offer. I'd still love to try a meal here one night after work, as I've yet to try any actual entrees. My only advice is that if you have the google offer to print it out before hand. While you don't have to, I did have to go into the office and log into my google on their office computer to print it out there."
"4.0","Wonderful service all around. Had a few drinks at the bar before dinner, bartender was great.Food was your standard chops and fish. Very well prepared and tasty. Also a great wine list - I recommend the 2003 Lascombes if you like Bordeaux.The location isnt the best (downtown) if you are looking for fun afterward."
"1.0","Checked on Facebook for their hours because you never know when they're open. Tonight, Sunday, December 23rd they say that they're open until 8:00 p.m. I call and order a pizza at 6:49 and he tells me they're closed!! I reminded him of their hours on Facebook and he responded that they hadn't had any calls in two hours and they stopped taking orders at 6:45!! I asked them to please make me a pizza, and reminded him that he answered the phone. He laughed and said no, we already cleaned up. We're closed. I will NEVER order a pizza from them again. Try Azimer's in Oakland, they deliver and they're ALWAYS open when they say they are."
"5.0","Chinatown Inn is one of my favorite places to eat in downtown Pittsburgh.  And also for about 10 years has been home to parties on the 2nd and 3rd floor hosted by The Humanaut Crew and sometimes others.Chinatown deserves 5 stars just for their carpet alone: http://www.flickr.com/photos/soulglo/2969694288/Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is real.  If you ever get the honor of being at a party upstairs, you would get to see this yourselves in all its majesty.That said, the food is good too.  Much better than any other place in downtown and it is worth the trek across downtown to eat there for lunch."
"3.0","We were looking for a fun place to eat lunch outside, have a few drinks, and enjoy the sunshine. We were seated immediately on the patio overlooking the river. Our server Informed us that this was their last weekend open as they were closing for winter the following day ... I mention this because they were out of a few drinks & ciders. Due to reviews & low Yelp rating, we thought we would try a few appetizers before ordering lunch. The fried avocado was AMAZING & plentiful. The peel 'n eat shrimp ($17) were small but plentiful ... but rather bland for the amount of seasoning that was on the shell??? The lobster roll was mediocre, especially with the $21 price tag. The wings were OK ... All in all, I would return for the atmosphere & view but wouldn't go hungry because I'm cheap and expect the meal to match the price tag!  Service was very slow and the server would disappear for 20 mins at a time. Again, a lot of these issues may have been due to it being their last weekend?? I hope this place survives because it's unique for Pittsburgh, but they seriously need to address the service issues and mediocre food."
"5.0","Let me just warn you now, this place is crazy spicy. I went in thinking I can handle a fair amount of spice and ordered the medium sandwich, boy was I wrong! Bf also ordered medium tenders which were also super spicy. However, once the pain goes away, the chicken was very flavorful. I also recommend getting the macaroni and cheese as a side. Sides and a drink are a little extra and aren't included. I think we're just gonna stick to mild the next time we're here."
"4.0","Upon walking through the doors, I felt like I was in Italy. Girasole is a very small space, but that made me feel like I was invited to someone's home for dinner. While some might feel congested, I liked the homey feel and the food only further added to that comforting, homey experience. Because the space is so small, I highly recommend making reservations in advance. I've heard reservations aren't always honored here, but I think it's always worth a shot. The menu is short and simple and it changes based on the season. I visited Girasole in January and every dish my table ordered was delicious and oh so comforting, perfect for the bitter cold temperature outside that evening. Of the dishes we ordered, the ravioli in tomato cream sauce was the table's favorite. The salad that comes with the meal was also quite nice and far more than just lettuce and dressing. Also, save room for dessert! We ordered tiramisu and panna cotta and both were out of this world!Girasole is definitely a win in my book for great Italian. I plan to visit once per season to get a taste of each of their menus!"
"1.0","DO NOT order the hoagies!!! I used to get pizza from here all the time and it was pretty good, nothing amazing but it was decent. Then I decided to branch out and try some other things on the menu. I ordered hoagies for me and my girlfriend and we both got incredibly sick. I decided it must have just been a fluke and ordered different hoagies the next time and got sick AGAIN. I will never order anything from here, any place that makes me that sick is not somewhere I want to order my food from."
"4.0","Decent food, always a good crowd. You can catch some of Pittsburgh's athletes here as well as out of town players. It's a good time."
"4.0","Quintessential Pittsburgh. A hit for our party of 5. I'm gonna say it- I liked it better than Primanti's.Hearty, creative sandwiches made with love and likely to keep you full all day. Dedicated following of regulars. Seats are old church pews! Some seriously good French fries. Service with a smile - and speedy. The decor, photos of local celebrities and business cards of patrons, tells the story of this local institution. What would have made it better: simple kids menu/pricing."
"5.0","So looking forward to visiting your restaurant Saturday the 23rd in celebration of my sister-in-law's wedding. Everything looks wonderful. YELP"
"4.0","Came here with a friend on Saturday around dinner time and was pleasantly surprised to be seated immediately. It looked like they had ample seating in the whole place, so that was a plus! We ordered the veggie bao bun (which they change on a weekly basis...I think..if not daily) and they actually brought out the meat bao instead. Even though the order was wrong, the meat bao was still good! I had the inferno ramen which was juuuust enough spice to not leave the place with steam coming from my mouth and ears. I would say spice level sits at about a 5 or 6 out of 10 on that dish. All in all I would return and try other things. I think the food and overall ambiance and location is great!"
"4.0","Food truck with decent food in the strip district. Food is good with reasonable price."
"5.0","Family went here before a concert at PPG Arena. The staff here are great and modified food based on our tastes. We had 6 of us and all were so happy with the taste and quantity of the yummy food. The check was less than $40 and the taste very authentic. We love Chinese food and this place is too on our list. They made my wife's dish gluten free which was nice of them."
"5.0","Everything is fantastic here!! My mouth waters when I come in here...everything looks and tastes amazing! They give you huge portions, so come when you're hungry. The restaurant is cafeteria style- you stand in line to order, then you pick from a wide variety of dishes what you want to eat. It's crowded around 1:00-3:00, so come as early as you can. They also have a market next door so you can shop while waiting for your food. I recommend trying the chicken schwarma or get a little bit of everything. The saag paneer is one of my favorite veggie dishes they serve. The chicken biryani and lamb curry are good, too. Besides the food, the staff is great too. When you're shopping in the Strip and need a quick lunch, stop at Salem's! You won't be disappointed!"
"4.0","I want to start off by saying I ate this sober, so my review is completely objective. In a city filled with phenomenal pie, Benny's surprised me by holding its own. As other reviewers have stated, the slices are big. Like bigger-than-your-head big. The pizza had a nice cheese to sauce ratio (heavy on the cheese). The bottom crust was slightly thinner than I prefer, but the end crust was thick and doughy. I did find it a bit greasy, but for $5 a (gigantic) slice, what more could you ask for?Compared to its competition, this is for sure the best pizza in South Side."
"2.0","The plates are listed as small, medium and large although apparently this doesn't relate to the quantity of food on each.  Not sure exactly what it relates to.  I ordered the scallops which was listed as medium but when the plate came there were 2 quarter seized scollops on top of some cooked greens.  Not my idea of medium, but as I said, perhaps this relates to something else.  My neighbor got a vegetarian dish which was listed as small and it's was over twice the size of mine.  Go figure?"
"4.0","Love this intimate neighborhood bar, even if the draft list is pretty limited.  If you want to hang with the locals, including the Mayor, this is the place to go.  They also have great trivia Wednesday nights at 9."
"4.0","Great lunch deal... $6-$8 for soup, spring roll and meal. Can't beat that. Panang curry was delicious! Only complaint was downstairs where the bathroom is was kind of smelly."
"4.0","My hubby and I took the hop on hop off bus tour and they suggested this place. He is not a fan of seafood really but he said he could find something. I ordered the lobster roll with fries and he had blackened Baja shrimp on rice with broccoli. Both meals were great!!! Service was excellent and you won't believe the fancy Bloody Mary they serve there!"
"5.0","Don't be put off by the decor in this place- their food is legit! I personally have had their cheese steak, hot Italian, and fries. Their bread is good, their meat is delicious, and their fries are FRESH not frozen. They're made to order, and perfection. Two people can easily share a small fry- the portions are generous. If you've got a hankering for a legitimate hoagie/sub, head to Peppi's. You won't be disappointed."
"5.0","Best tacos since San Diego. Real street tacos with fresh ingredients. We will be back. Carnitas were delicious! Be prepared to eat on the bench or get food to go."
"4.0","Just lovely! I had family in from out of town as we all had a relative being treated at AGH. I convinced them to walk the couple of blocks to try this place, as I had read about it somewhere. Though the neighborhood is still on the upswing and has a less than pristine facade, this place is a gem! Beautifully decorated, clean, and welcoming. The staff was helpful and patient. And most importantly the tea was delicious... with the lavender and the peach apple cobbler being my favorites. Everyone in my party ordered teas and sandwiches; and everyone was as equally impressed with the quality."
"5.0","My Uber driver recommended this place during my recent business trip. As it happened we were close by after a meeting and dropped in for lunch. I think for dinner you probably want to call ahead for a reservation. It's casual but super cute. The lunch menu had great choices for a good price point. My colleague got the pasta which was perfectly al dente. I had the polenta, escarole bean dish which came with a salad. The salad was lightly dressed and tasty. The polenta was soft and flavorful covered in a light layer of mozzarella cheese. The beans and escarole were braised in a light tomato broth. Each bite was soul satisfying. Our waitress was attentive despite the restaurant getting progressively busier. I will have to come back for dinner so I can enjoy with a glass of wine!"
"1.0","Long time customer... 3/22/14 officially no longer a customer. They charge you for an XL pizza, '16 slices' and give you a LARGE pizza in a smaller box. Took a long time but now a SELL OUT pizza shop. Hope the rest of the Southside Community stays away from Gennaros. Sad day for a pizza lover."
"5.0","Yes, it's a chain, so yes, it might be fun to go to a more unique, dedicated Pittsburgh steakhouse.  The fact of the matter though is that this is probably the best steak in the city.  The menu depth and service is always fantastic - have been here countless times and have always left very happy."
"5.0","Awesome beer! We love sours and they had some really great ones.. We didn't try the food but would next time"
"5.0","The Summit is a fantastic bar and now restaurant. It's small, and the selection is somewhat limited, but it certainly has all the right stuff.  The atmosphere is fantastic. Everything from the music to the lighting is exactly what you would want from a neighborhood high class joint. The drinks are better than ever. Since opening in 2013 they've made improvements to their classics and added seasonal drinks that are great. Their beer selection has improved as well."
"5.0","HIGHLY RECOMMENDED this place ! If you want to have amazing and delicious breakfast YOU MUST visit this caffe ! Atmosphere and design is really cool ! Gonna come back for sure !  Service is great ! Thank you !"
"4.0","I had a wonderful breakfast at Pamela's. The food really is delicious, but quite expensive for breakfast! Our bill came to about $40 for 3 people. That's a lot of money for eggs and pancakes!!We were a little overwhelmed when we first arrived because the waiting area was packed. They told us only 10-15 mins and it was spot-on, which we were pleasantly surprised about! Our server came to us right away. I could immediately see how fast-paced they work to keep their customers flowing on a busy morning!Everyone in my group would agree that the best part of the meal was the lyonnaise potatoes. My friend recommended asking for the potatoes to be 'crispy' and I'm glad I did. They were absolutely delicious. A crunchy coating on top with soft potatoes and onions underneath. YUM.I ordered the Gail's eggs which were scrambled eggs topped with green onion and cream cheese. It came with a side of potatoes and two gigantic pieces of bread. The eggs were done perfectly and I although I had never had cream cheese on eggs before, it was delicious!! It's going to be hard to avoid cooking my eggs like that from now on! One of my friends ordered the breakfast special with 2 eggs, meat and a side of their specialty blueberry hotcakes. It falls somewhere between a crepe and a pancake. They cook a giant pancake and roll it up over a variety of fillings. It looks beautiful and tastes delicious! If it's too sweet to order for your whole meal, it's definitely worth ordering as a side for a few to split just to get a taste! My other friend ordered a daily special which was Chorizo hash served with eggs and tortillas. There was a surprising amount of meat and he was very pleased with his meal as well.The food is great and I was happy to finally experience this Pittsburgh gem. Prepare to pay more than your typical diner, but you certainly won't be disappointed by the quality!"
"3.0","I had the queso appetizer, shrimp tacos, and sides of the house salad and the poblanos in cream sauce. I also had a mojito and a water.I'd say good food, good drinks, good portions, moderate prices, and excellent atmosphere.I took two stars off for service. It took about 15 minutes just to get out drinks/appetizers when there were only 4 tables being served. We then had to wait til our meals arrived to receive our utensils and napkins se we had queso all over our hands until then. I got one refill on my water but that was after I finished my entire meal, so my mouth was filled with pepper spice the whole time."
"5.0","If ur Turkish living in America would die for Turkish food, This is the place u need to go! I felt like home. I ordered Adana kebab. It was so good, they have home made Turkish desserts. Kunefe is bomb!! They have great patio. It s going to be my favorite dinner place in shadyside. My friend Eto recommended, special thank to him and Pasha Cafe team. You guys doing great job !!"
"2.0","As far as a place to have a drink and watch a game - 5 stars! The venue is AWESOME. Tons of big tvs, plenty of space and a unique seating structure. Unfortunately, I wasn't at City Works to watch a game, I was there for dinner - fish tacos to be specific. Between my overcooked and chewy fish tacos and my husband's underwhelming ribs, I can't say I'm a fan of the food at CW, but I do truly enjoy the ambiance and will be back for drinks again someday."
"5.0","I discovered Salem's nearly 3 years ago, after buying a Groupon for the place. When I walked in, I was suprised by the 'cafeteria' set-up, with a large open area to sit and eat, a very casual atmosphere indeed. The menu was listed on a large board, with so many options I was overwhelmed. Most of the items listed I had: A. Never Heard of Before or B. Never Tried.  I was intrigued by the menu and everything smelled delicious, so I listened to the patrons infront of me in line, and went ahead with what they ordered-- the chicken schwarma. I had never tried Indian food before, but to me, it looked like a gyro and I was willing to try that-- the 2 ppl ahead of me liked it, so maybe I would to. At the end of the long counter of food options, was a section of dessert, so I took a piece of baklava and paid for my meal, which was just under $10. That's a pretty good deal I'd say, considering the large portions you get at Salem's. The schwarma had a mouth-watering smell-- definitely made with curry and other Indian spices and fresh, warm bread, I couldn't wait to dig in. I was suprised by the taste, it was so different from anything I'd ever had before, but I loved it! It was so good I tried to finish the whole thing, but there was no way, because it is a big portion of food, more than I could eat in one sitting. I was so satified with my meal, that I vowed to make it a regular spot for lunch if I was in the area.Over the last few years, I've been back many times and have tried other things, but I always seem to go back to my first love, the shwarma. **Also, the employees are so friendly, you feel very welcome there! I'm so glad that they offered a Groupon for this place, because I would've probably never tried it & just grabbed lunch at Peppi's or something 'safe/norm', not knowing about it, but in my opinion, the food here is better!! Try it, you will be having sweet dreams of schwarma."
"5.0","I've never had a single hint of a problem with these guys (and gals). The food is always delicious, the fries are amazing, the prices are reasonable for the area, and everything works together like a charm.I typically go with the Porkgasm, the Pinkman, The Sloppy Top, or the PGH Cheesesteak, but all their salads and other options are delicious as well. If you're looking for great food served with a laid-back, yet obviously attentive attitude, hit this place up.Not to mention, they have a healthy respect for all things Lionel Richie, which can only be a bonus in my book."
"3.0","Our appetizer salads were delicious and the ahi tuna was flavorful and seared just right. The filet and ribeye were cooked perfectly (very juicy and pink but also cooked at 500 degrees). The deserts were a knockout due to the house-made dark chocolate.We had a large party and were pleasantly surprised that we were seated in a private room. The space and the staff made our celebration absolutely perfect. However, here are my complaints:The vegetables, such as the broccoli and the asparagus, were NOT fresh. They were certainly frozen and then cooked. Many other nearby restaurants offer locally grown, fresh vegetables on their menus.The menu is not friendly for those with gluten or dairy issues. And forget it if you're vegan. The prices are not propionate to the quality. When it comes to the beef, they nailed it, but everything else on the menu does not live up to the price tag. You could go to Spoon or Altius and pay less for amazing atmosphere AND everything is delicious."
"1.0","Okay, so I've heard a lot of good things about this place. And I wanted to like it!But it was seriously bad. I very rarely eat somewhere and don't finish my food simply because I don't like it. But I couldn't eat it. I got the Shadyside and it was super greasy, and the flavor just wasn't there. My roommate got the Portabella and she wasn't feelin' it either.The guy who served us was cool beans though."
"5.0","We were able to get day-of reservations for a Friday night at 8:30pm.  The restaurant was small, tastefully decorated and brighter than your average evening fine dining restaurant.We got:-two glasses of Cabernet- great wine -fresh mozzarella with heirloom tomatoes.  Delicious with a little coarse salt and balsamic-chopped salad with a little cheese, salami and a very tasty vinaigrette.  Even though I am not much of a salad person, it was great and tasted very fresh-salad with balsamic dressing - wasn't as good as the chopped salad, but still quite good-half order of fresh pasta with Parmesan, zucchini and tomatoes -the perfect size for a lighter meal- I ate all of it.  I worried the pasta would be too heavy for a late dinner, but it was perfect in the smaller portion-skirt steak- this was my boyfriend's third dish with balsamic.  Perhaps by that time he had had enough balsamic, but it wasn't stellar.  The meat was cooked perfectly and the portion was generous-tiramisu- tasty!-French press coffee and cappuccino- very good as well, fresh Overall, it was an excellent meal and the smaller portions allowed us to try many different things on the menu.  Without a doubt, we will be back as the menu changes seasonally/weekly.  The menu was smaller so you could tell how the chefs spent time curating each dish and picking items in season."
"5.0","We checked out redbeard's after a show and had a blast! Chris was our bartender and he was super attentive and made us feel welcome... even as the bar started to clear out he didn't rush us to leave. We had great conversation and great drinks :) we would go back again anytime!"
"1.0","Myself and a work colleague were finishing up lunch and paying and waitress took our bill with tip included, and made a motion to a woman waiting for a table.  She said to the lady, 3 min. Table will be ready. We were gathering our stuff and mid conversation and clearly leaving, and waitress said 'hey guys come on,  people are waiting for this table'. Extremely rude. Probably will turn around and leave if I see her again working. She looked like a regular too. Perhaps our 1:00 to 1:45 lunch was too long?!?!?    I thought that was extremely rude. Too bad because great food!"
"5.0","This place never fails me. The service is good, the food delicious and the portions generous. Wish they delivered!"
"5.0","I agree, Yelp - As good as it gets! Starting with the service (especially Chris the manager) the staff is as welcoming as the decor. We had a large group (9) and we were late for our reservation. No problem, even with a packed house on Valentine's Day. We had a number of apps, including an outstanding bruschetta, and they were all well liked and devoured. There were a few pizzas for dinner that drew a lot of 'yum' sounds, I sampled my wife's mushroom risotto that was truffle-laced heaven, and I ordered a hot sausage panini that was different and delicious. Can't say enough good things about Mezzo. Just remember the meatballs are only available downstairs!"
"5.0","This is definitely the best fried chicken in Pittsburgh. The was tender and juicy with a nice crispy coating. Don't believe others that say the spice level is hot. I had the Hot level and it was as spicy as chocolate milk. I will surely be getting the Damn Hot in my next visit."
"5.0","This probably my favorite Chinese Place to get some pretty great Chinese food. The Sweet and Sour chicken is my favorite thing to get here.  The people are very nice and the service is great. The decor is nice and gives the place a very nice touch.  I really recommend my family and close friends to come here cause the food is very great."
"3.0","Excellent service and a menu with lots of healthy and delicious choices. The salads looks great, but I opted for the veggie burger, which was pretty good. The store is connected to the juice bar next door, so it's convenient to slide over there for a juice."
"5.0","Best Indian we've had since we moved to Pittsburgh! I think a lot of the bad reviews come from the buffet or from the spicy levels. Unlike other places we've found around here, they actually bring the heat without being overpowering.We opted for an order of chicken tikka masala, malai kofta and naan. The chicken was in large, juicy chunks and the kofta was well seasoned and creamy. The naan was crispy and chewy all at the same time.I think they also do happy hour specials from 5-7 that includes $3 off chicken entrees and a rotating deal of cheaper appetizers depending on the day. We'll definitely be coming back here often!"
"5.0","I've been stalking this place for a couple years.  As a transplant, I'm finding all my philly favorites in Pittsburgh.  Well, I found my ramen!   I do not have pictures of my 'snacks' because I wolfed them down so quickly.   Crispy pig ears are a must and the pork bao, so amazing.  Now on to the ramen, I go the signature and my husband got the inferno.... so unctuous.  Great mouth feel, wonderful broth, so many textures, just a flavor Explosion with just the right amount of spice.   If you're into ramen and in Pittsburgh whether forever or passing through, please make Ki Ramen a stop, you won't regret it!"
"2.0","Big time Fumble So I guess I went there on an off night.   My colleagues and I were there for dinner and while the place was say half busy it seems the front of the house was in chaos.  The waitstaff were nice but the meal really took a turn.  It seems they were badly under staffed and it shows.  So the first odd thing was our drinks we're served in plastic cups,  maybe this is a thing there or maybe they did not have enough clean glass ware?  It seems very out of place to me in what is a high brow look.  The meal took close to 40 minutes to come out and it was meh.  I ordered the chicken pasta and parts were cold, my guess sitting in the window too long.  Other dishes were a chicken club and fish tocos, none of which should've required 40 minutes. I also ordered a second drink that never came,  I'm not sure if the bartender or server dropped the ball there.The bathroom was messy, garbage over flowing, one stall had not toilet paper, another had a light out. When I asked to see the manager I was informed that she was on the line cooking and could not come out to talk.  I did get my drink comped and left but for me, an out of town guy, what should've been a once in a lifetime experience was an experience in really meh service"
"1.0","This has to be the nastiest McDonald's on the planet. Trash overflowing and on the floor, spilled drinks, slow service, rude employees...avoid this shit show and go hungry."
"5.0","I stopped here after visiting Dave's Music Mine a couple doors away and they highly recommended it. Man was this place good. It reminds me of the kind of taqueria you would find in southern texas.I had the pork tacos and chose flour tortillas.  $3 each and well worth it. My daughter had the vegetarian black bean tacos and loved them.We will be back to try the nachos next time."
"4.0","Went here for a quick meal and some drinks during the week. The variety of beers was great and I loved the fruity ones (I'm a typical girl lol). Food was tasty and the staff was timely. I recommend asking for recommendations while there, you won't be disappointed."
"4.0","We went to this place on a Saturday night after 10:00 pm. We were a large group, so they directed us to the second floor that was less crowded and less noisy and more suitable for a group who want to chat. The service was good but a little bit slow. It took a long time until our sandwiches finally got to the table. I ordered 'Yinz Guys Hungry?' The portion size was decent but not as big as would be expected from the name. The food was good ( not great, especially the cheese could be much better). It is a good place if you wan to hang out with a bunch of friends and you haven't made reservations and don't like to wait in a line and prefer a somehow quiet place and don't care much about the quality of the food. BTW many competing options are available on the same street."
"2.0","This is a decent place the food was the ok and the cookies are great. The only problem is that 30 minutes after I started to have the worst stomach ache of my life. I'm not sure if it was something I ate previously but I'm pretty sure it was because of the weird looking beef fried rice I had. If you like Chinese food go for it but I don't think I'm going to come back."
"4.0","You have to know what you're looking for to find it, like all things in life.The door is around the corner from a large bar, with a sign that's more of a Japanese stamp than indicator of what's within.  You must be able to climb 2 flights of stairs (not ADA friendly at all), and as you go up the narrow stairs, you feel transported to a Shinjuku nightclub. It's loud and the dj's at the end of the bar are skilled. So loud that I couldn't hear the hostess or my waitress, but they are willing to get up close and talk right in your ear. They only have high tops, which I always hate because the angle makes my feet dangle and my thighs fall asleep. But...Their food is extraordinary. I over ordered because I couldn't decide. They had a thick okonomiyaki filled with big chunks of pork and broccoli- unusual filling for traditional okonomiyaki, but delicious. There were fat slices of grilled eggplant topped with ground chicken that were creamy and fresh in the best ways. Personally I thought the eggplant was a bit thick to deal with given that the chicken was juicy and the whole thing difficult to eat with chopsticks, but it was so good flavor and presentation wise. The outstanding winner for me was the delicate egg custard, savory and mushroom filled. It reminded me of a superb homemade silky tofu with lots of flavor in that creamy little pot.Overall they have a great chef in the kitchen, and a warm, thumping vibe in front."
"3.0","The Mexican food here isn't going to rock your world but it is decent.   The chips and salsa are addicting.   The guacamole is good but not amazing.  I made a lot of so-so choices on the extensive menu until one day I tried the mahi mahi tacos, which have become my go-to on the menu.  The tacos have avocado, pico de gallo and some kind of creamy chipotle sauce. Topped with fresh lime, it's very flavorful.   They also come with a healthy side of beans and rice.The turnaround at lunch is very quick and you can stop here before a show in the evening with no wait.  I also love the margaritas, particularly the mango one."
"5.0","Its very simple...I am from New York City, I work for a Michelin star restaurant and am pretty critical.  This was possibly the best Chinese food I have ever had.  Fresh, quality ingredients and great service."
"5.0","Came in for takeout - the place was clean and lit well and the service was friendly! Food was excellent. I will def be returning!"
"3.0","This place is run of the mill and generic as far as Mexican restaurants go. I, once again, ignored my lactose intolerance and shared the queso dip with my sis. It was addictive and I was sad when it was done.We also shared the beef fajitas and ordered extra tortillas so that there'd be enough to go around. And, thank GOODNESS. The portion was huge and the meat was perfectly cooked and seasoned. It came out sizzling with sides of rice, sour cream, guac, and refried beans that was really enough for just one person. We couldn't even finish the beef and veggies, they were so plentiful.  We were quite happy to have the leftovers for late night eats. The service was great and it was a low key place to grab some good food before a night watching some a Point Park Conservatory Performance."
"3.0","This was my favorite restaurant until last night. White bean dip was served with slices of rye bread instead of the usual that they serve. This showed me they did not want us there. Waitress was rude und it took her awhile to take our order. I have told a lot of people about this place, but will not go back."
"3.0","For food preparation, presentation 3 stars..service 3 stars...the interior is a 1 star...since the front door could use a good cleaning and the entry floor a little sticky.  The price for the food earns 3.5 stars and the amount of food generous. We were a larger group and were accommodated well. I would return if in the neighborhood."
"2.0","This place isn't good. Been here quite a few times just because it's right on the river and a place to grab a quick bite when you're boating but I continue to be disappointed. The big draw is 'all you can eat crab legs' every day but only 2 out of the 6ish times I've been here have they been decent. Most times they are overcooked and rubbery which is unacceptable for how much they charge. They also serve soggy canned green beans as your dinner side with these- no thanks. Seen brown lettuce in the salads plenty of times too.. They give you dirty plastic cups to drink from too that have grime ground into the plastic from god knows when. The service is subpar also and the music they play is bizarre. You'll have hard core rap one minute, then metal, then country..really weird ambiance. The only good thing about this place is the river views and if you're lucky to get the crab legs once in a blue moon when they're actually cooked well."
"4.0","Hambone's is a great dive bar/restaurant with awesome food and great drinks. As a vegetarian, it can be tough to find options at divey places, but Hambone's delivers! Their Gouda Mac and cheese is AMAZING and the black bean burger is incredible. It was beyond just an average veggie burger and had a nice balsamic glaze with grilled mushrooms and onions. Really great combination!The bar can be crowded depending on what time you arrive, and the area surrounding the bar is small. There is some seating against the wall, and additional dining room seating in the next room. They frequently have events such as live bands or, when we were there, a burlesque event. Most have a cover to enter the dining room, but the bar is always open for business. Definitely recommend for a laid back experience in Lawrenceville."
"5.0","Pro:- amazing Spanish tapas- patient and accommodating staff- the great selection of beers and wines- unique atmosphereCon:- expect lines- a little bit crowded"
"5.0","Thus my favorite vegan restaraunts in Pittsburgh! The food is so yummy, the staff is friendly and are helpful. I especially love the hours and knowing that there is a place to get yummy warm, vegan food when I am on the Go. I can't recommend B52.café more highly."
"4.0","Having lived in Dubai, Doha, and Manama for several years, this place definitely does a wonderful job of inviting me to relive some of my favorite culinary memories. Wicked friendly staff, tasty food, wide selection. The market next door, also operated by Salem's is full of Middle Eastern goodies."
"5.0","Yuzu Kitchen has amazing happy hour specials, a super friendly staff, great food, and beautiful decor. I ordered some veg ramen with an egg and the flavors were spot on. Portions are HUGE. I also tried a few cocktails, the one with Lavender & Gin was my favorite. Before our meal, we ordered the fried tofu & edamame. I was really surprised by the portion of both appetizers. The tofu was crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and seasoned with just the right amount of salt, pepper, and green onions. The edamame was cooked PERFECTLY. Our waitress was patient, charming, and silly, which I found very pleasing. I can't believe how much food we got for the price we paid. This place seems like it would be good for small groups, or for an intimate evening for loved ones. I will definitely be back with some friends because more people need to see how amazing it is."
"4.0","Okay so based off the reviews on here we were not going to come but it was a nice day and a good atmosphere to have lunch so we decided to go. It was actually pretty good! My mom said she heard good things about it from friends at work. I don't know if they got a new cook or what, but for the time we went it was actually pretty busy and the food was great! We are definitely looking forward to visiting again! Get the shrimp and crab pizza"
"5.0","Was walking down the street one day and stumbled upon Arnold's, all I can say is that I am glad.  The first thing I noticed was the space and the decor, both pleasing. I have enjoyed many teas and sandwiches since then, and hope the Arnold's continues to expand on the menu."
"4.0","A great place in a great location! I have been a regular customer at this location of The Yard, and they always have me coming back from more. Great staff that will make truthful recommendations depending on the dietary restrictions of your party. Always have the sports games going on and you can always expect a great conversation at the bar. Would definitely recommend making a reservation as certain times it can get fairly busy."
"5.0","My daughters and I have been going to this restaurant for many years. The owners are really nice and so are the servers. We eat at Indian restaurants all over the area and outside of Pgh too. We feel this is the best Indian food in Pittsburgh. One of my daughters is vegan. They are very accommodating. We highly recommend it. Parking can be challenging but it's worth it."
"1.0","2 doors are clearly marked handicapped accessible.  No button to push to actually make those accessible.  Had to wait for someone else to come through to hold doors for me.  Asked for assistance on way out.  The person giving order said he would help after he gave me my order.  However, after he gave me my food, he turned his back on me and ignored me.  I sat in front of the door for 5 minutes until someone else came in and held the door for me.  When I called the 'manager' Asha could not even understand what I was talking about and gave me the 'general manager' Keisha.  I could hear her laughing as she passed the phone.  Keisha said she was sorry but handicapped people come in all the time.  They even have regulars that are handicapped.  When I asked how do they get in, she couldn't tell me just that they come in all the time.  Worse-when I was sitting in line, another employee came over to open a new line.  She sneezed loudly and conspicuously into her hands then yelled , 'Next!'  and starting waiting on customers without washing her hands first."
"5.0","Had the Fox Chapel burger, which was amazing. The fresh-cut rosemary fries were the best fries I've ever had. Awesome New England IPA. Highly recommend this whole meal from a foodie with high standards."
"5.0","Wonderful food!  Came here with a bunch of friends and everything I ate was delicious!  I had the cheese plate, bone marrow, and ahi tuna.  All of it was just so good!  I will be back!"
"1.0","Sorry we can't give it a zero. The food was beyond awful.  Went with a group -the chicken Marsala was so sweet that it was inedible, the veal parm was heavily fried & dry and the salmon beyond dry and overdone.  Deserts were a very rubbery tasteless cheesecake and dry dry dry brownie.  Avoid !!! Noise level was very loud and painful because room was small for group.  And the decor of the restaurant was stuck in a time warp and not in a positive nor tasteful way.  Run do not walk away ...."
"5.0","Love love love the atmosphere and the beer!! Super cool place to hang out, relax and enjoy the beer. We were able to sit outside with our pup! Highly recommend for a Sunday funday"
"5.0","This restaurant is amazing in so many ways! The food is incredible - we got the buffet tonight and loved the baklava, hummus, chicken tikka masala, chana masala, and grape leaves. And the staff were so kind and friendly. This is actually my first Yelp review ever - I just had to share how awesome this place is. I'll be coming back next time I'm in Pittsburg!"
"2.0","Ya know that feeling when you are disappointed you just threw that money away? That's how I felt at Burgh'ers. Another overpriced / underwhelming burger joint jumping on the burger-craze train.The staff was all very nice. The food is all over priced, especially for the portion size. $13 for their standard burger. The guy next to me got his burger while I waited for mine, and I just assumed he bought the smaller $10 size burger. Well, you know what they say about assuming...The burger patty was pretty small and flat, but it was seasoned well. Nothing like you would expect for the price. Similar sized to a single patty at Five Guys. The restaurant also feels cold and lifeless. Not warm and welcoming at all. And with the concrete ceilings and no sound absorbing materials, it was very loud even with the small amount of people there at the time.Save your money and go to Five Guys instead."
"5.0","A gut truck no más! This hombre is living the American dream and turned this into a full fledged restaurant. It's still in the works, but has so much potential. You still have to order from the front cashier, but it looks like they'll be taking tableside orders soon. It also looks like they're about to have a bar soon! There's still a steel encased salsa bar, a schmattering of Mexican refreshments, and all the Mexican meal basics. This place is legit. Bring your hankering-for-Mexican ass down here and give them your money so they can take this restaurant to the next level!"
"4.0","We stayed at a hotel nearby overnight but we didn't get any coffee when we left in the morning.  We were going to brunch at a place nearby but decided to try this little place out because we don't have any little coffee shops in our town.  Nothing too special inside but just a good kind of neighborhood feel.  They have their regulars and you can bring your dog in here too!  I wish we had something like this close to us.  We both ordered a cappuccino.  We sat down and enjoyed it.  They have pastries here and other food if you are interested.  If we weren't going to brunch I would probably have ordered something.  They have a large menu for different cravings as their name suggestions.  The cappuccinos were really good and if you in the neighborhood and want some caffeine definitely stop by this place and check it out!"
"2.0","Well... I'm surprised they offer a brunch menu. I actually only thought it was a bar. Come to find out they have a dining room next door. Seems kind of like a diner. Which brings me to my next point. It was okay diner food. The brunch menu actually looked pretty promising with some delicious looking breakfast sandwiches. Since I wanted something a bit lighter, I went with the omelet loaded with veggies and cheddar cheese. I didn't realize it came with potatoes until I got it in front of me. Plus toast. Which is nice, but I wish I would have been told from my server so I could have ordered wheat... if they had it. The omelet was okay, but the veggies were still kinda hard, like it wasn't cooked very long. And the homefries weren't very crispy, which in my opinion is the best way to do them. So here's the weird thing. Everyone ended up getting their food in shifts. We had a party of 8, so it was pretty large, but we were literally the only party in there other than another four top. First shift got their breakfast sandwiches. They'd eaten most of their meal by the time the second shift got their waffles. The third shift was 3 people who'd ordered omelets. It just seemed odd that it took so long in between. I wouldn't have noticed much if it was by a few minutes. But it was a good fifteen or more. It wasn't horrible, because there was good company, but it definitely wasn't the best service I'd had. Not sure about the bar area of Hambone's, but I probably wouldn't come back for brunch."
"4.0","Good food, nice variety of dishes... I subtracted one star only because it's more of a casual place, cafeteria-style."
"5.0","Love this downtown lunch spot! The service was amazing and the young gentleman helped me so much and was very happy to be at work. He even remembered some regulars first name. Great customer service! The food was also delicious with great salads and burritos. There is also a really neat coffee shop inside too!"
"5.0","One of my fav places to eat.  As a vegetarian, there is always something for me to eat.  Try the limeade...its amazing.  Their ahi hot sauce is also awesome.  I always buy a bottle on my way out.  A great hearty meal.  A must try."
"4.0","Visited for the first time on a Tuesday night using a Groupon. There was no wait, though they do take reservations. Great happy hour prices and the burgers were definitely worth it given the local sourcing, and the Groupon. We tried the Polish Hill burger and the Fox Chapel burger - both were delicious. Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the burger patties were kind of slim compared to other places where you pay $13 for a burger. Happy hour specials can be found in the attached  photo."
"4.0","Salads here are really delish!  I could eat them every day. This place is insanely packed during the lunch hours and extremely loud. It's is sometimes  hard to find a place to sit."
"5.0","Chicken came out really well, similar to Koreatown in Oakland (California). The manager lady is sweet and treats you right."
"4.0","Friendliness and timeliness of service vary, but atmosphere and food are always fantastic. Go on a date Sunday night for 1 app, 1 bread, and 2 entrees for $25!"
"2.0","Even with the low rating, this is the only place I get pizza from in Oakland. It's just sort of like a tradition; no other pizza shop can compete with the Antoon's large plain pie for less than 5 dollars.Get the garlic crust. It's not on the menu, but they'll prepare your crust with some extra spices and flavors which makes you think you're eating something delicious instead of cheap."
"2.0","It's true that there are not a lot of options on Mt. Washington but I feel like this review is still valid. The beer selection is good (great if you consider the location) but don't be surprised if you end up with a larger tab than expected or a very expensive six pack. Very few beers in the cooler and none of the drafts are priced. We don't have any problem spending money on good beer but if Pack and Dogs is looking to deliver a surprise, the surprise is always bad. I don't think that it's asking too much to know the price of the cooler or draft beer and I don't know of any other six packs to go places that don't label the cost of their bottles. The product is good but I'm confused by the delivery."
"4.0","The food is five star. We were there for our 40th anniversary. There was only one other couple in the entire dining area, and the hostess sat us right beside them. Very awkward for both of us. Why do that?  With no one else there, it was uncomfortable. The drinks were good,but very small servings. My martini barely filled half the glass. Same with my wife's wine. As others have mentioned, the chairs are VERY uncomfortable. I'm glad the food was outstanding."
"3.0","So I should preface this review with the fact that I'm a vegan, so my options are limited. Anyway, I had the ramen noodles with their veggie broth and loaded with veggies. It was just okay. Nothing memorable about it and could have used some extra fixings to jazz it up a bit. I will say I love the vibe in here. Although the two times I went it was literally empty on a Saturday evening, they had a nice playlist going and the bar area is super trendy. I'd be willing to come back and try their other vegan friendly apps."
"5.0","this is such a nice place I like to go to, I think their omelettes and lattes are the best in town. and the owners are really very friendly and hard workers.They recently remade the patio and those colorful umbrellas look just phenomenal. I feel so peaceful sitting in that patio and eat my delicious breakfast on Saturday mornings.  if you didn't try this place before you definitely should because I think you're missing a lot."
"4.0","This place is always a favorite stop when visiting Pittsburgh and the food never disappoints. The menu has changed in the last few years, so some of my go-to orders that were on the lunch menu are no longer served. (Bring back the curried chicken salad!) The brunch menu consists mostly of egg dishes, but the standouts for us were the BiBimBap & the Herbed French Toast. Servers are always friendly, but often seem a little confused. You can definitely expect to wait a while for your drinks to be made, so don't expect a quick meal at Coca Cafe. So take the opportunity to order a drink, I'd recommend the Lavender Steamer, and relax before your food comes."
"5.0","Went with my wife and friends on a Saturday night.  The service and atmosphere were very good.  Cocktails were excellent. The menu is eclectic (Octopus!) and somewhat limited, but well conceived with options for all tastes (steaks, vegan options, pasta, seafood, etc.).  The romaine salad and chicken wings (a shared app) were both delicious.  I ordered the hanger steak and was rewarded with a perfectly prepared medium rare steak paired with crispy potatoes and mushrooms in a flavorful, tasty sauce.  My wife (pasta) and our friends were equally happy with their meals.  Maybe a little pricey ($140 total for my wife and I with taxes and tip), but worth the cost for the food and overall experience."
"4.0","A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!!The sauce is so good. Absolutely yummy. You think a New York slice is big? Those slices ain't got nothing on the size of a Virginia slice.Honestly it's true that a piece is as big as one's head...or in my case the size of my arse (which is plentiful)!Slices about $5 each which is the way we usually go, However, we've on occasion bought an entire pie which by the way is 28 inches. No joke, it's enormous.You'd think pies this big wouldn't be Cooke properly and may be raw/doughy. Not the case. Cooked to perfection.Worried about leftover? You'll have them for days. So glad Pittsburgh is one of a handful of cities that's home to this smaller pizza shop chain. Pepperoni pizza here is my favorite."
"2.0","Interesting Peruvian handicraft exhibition & sales, nice atmosphere.Don't go for the food, though - it's stored in portions and heated in the microwave."
"3.0","The chicken was great. Super crispy skin and a nice amount of sauce. I got the Soy Garlic Sauce and my boyfriend got the Sweet and Spicy; both were good. Originally, though, I'd wanted the Chicken Salad on the menu, but they said they didn't sell that. My boyfriend also ordered radish pickles and was told those were included with the chicken. They gave us a little plastic dressing-cupful of the pickles, which were decent. Listening to other people order, it sounded like other sides might have been included as well, and I wish they'd explained our options when we ordered.We ate in the shop, and they have little gloves for your thumb, pointer, and middle fingers, which were very handy. The chicken was great, but this place is on the more expensive side. Also, two of the three times we wanted to eat there, it was closed, so be sure to check the hours before going."
"5.0","Stumbled upon this place looking for a late dinner after a zine fair in Highland Park. Familiar with Oakland, we drove over and found easy parking, welcomed by a very nice staff and a good-vibes atmosphere. I tried paneer palak for the first time at Yuva Indian and immediately fell in love - I have always been one for Indian cuisine and had been eager to try this dish. The paneer palak was creamy, perfectly tasty, and spicy! The waiter asks you regarding spice level; I usually get the spiciest when I go out for Asian cuisine, and I would say the dish was spicy but certainly allowed for taste of dynamic Indian flavors. I discovered Yuva Indian with a friend who had never before tried such flavorful cuisine - I would say this is a great eatery for someone new to Indian - very round flavors and sauces. My friend tried the chicken tikka masala and loved it. Ever since going to Yuva Indian my love for such a culture has only grown as I explore my own abilities cooking Indian food and seek out other tasty ethnic food joints in the Pittsburgh area. We will most definitely be back!"
"4.0","I've lived in this area for three years and have never tried this place. I'm so glad I finally did. Stopped in on a Saturday morning after looking for new breakfast places to try on Yelp. It's a cute little café that offers a lot of different items - including its own ice cream parlor. I love a good breakfast sandwich and after seeing all the different options, I knew I was at the right place. I ordered the Butchie that has fried capicola, provolone, a fried egg and tomatoes on it. It traditionally comes on a bagel, but they were out. However, I got it on a croissant instead and it was SO good. I also got a hot coffee, which was also great. Everything here is homemade and the staff was super friendly. Seemed like they knew everyone that walked in the door. Will definitely come back!"
"5.0","Mario's is a great place to go on a Saturday night! It's a huge area with many different bar areas along with seating. They also have weekly event nights such as trivia and karaoke. It's definitely a bar in which many young people come to (esp. during university semesters!) I never thought of Mario's as a place to enjoy a good meal, and wow did I miss out! The food at mario's is well priced, served quickly, and delicious!! They give huge serving sizes, and everything tastes great! Mario's provides a great deal during happy hours and throughout the week with both beer and food. I definitely recommend this bar for both a night out and the dinner beforehand!"
"4.0","Oh my gosh this review is going to get weird, but anyway. My nephew needed to take his car to the dealership in Bloomfield, he asked if I wanted to go. As I am originally from Bloomfield and only go back about once a year I said sure. Then I thought about Tram's and said that I saw them on Yelp and would love to go back there again. (It has been about 25 years since I was last there). Well anyway we went looking for Tram's and couldn't find it so I was like, 'I'm positive that it's here', (Penn Avenue, close to Garfield.) Whelp finally I'm like 'there it is', but it was all boarded up :( but alas after going on line again we found that they had moved about 15 blocks farther down on Penn Avenue closer to Lawrenceville. When we pulled up I was like, 'omg, really??? This used to be a pizza shop and I lived on the third floor for like a year 35 years ago!!!'. We came into Tram's, the owner was the same guy who owned the other one, and he looked EXACTLY the same as he did 25 years ago and I was like that can't be him but it was. So I asked him when they had moved to the current location and he said 22 years ago. I said did this used to be a pizza shop? He said 'yes'. I said, 'omg I lived upstairs on the 3rd floor about 35 years ago. TOOOO funny! They even go to St. Joe's Church. Blast from the past!Whew! Anyway, guy was super nice, fresh rolls were outstanding, and beef pho was on point. (Meat was a little on the fatty side though). Stuff like this makes me miss Bloomfield."
"5.0","Best pizza in pittsburgh and great people. Our favorite pie is the white boy. Go to dancing gnome on Fridays and grab a beer and a pizza and you will be happy."
"2.0","Tacos are still delicious but service has been horrible the last few months. The cooks are good but there's one cashier who is just awful... rude, rushes you despite there being no line, impatient and overall just seems annoyed the whole timeI have recommended this place to countless people. Not to mention brought my friends here from out of town.. I've brought my family here from out of state the girl's horrible attitude totally ruined it for all of them."
"3.0","Had I not read all the other reviews here, I would not have had any idea how bad this location was. However I had a reasonable experience. I got my food in decent time and it was fresh and I got in and out just like that. The funny thing I noticed was the no loitering sign which allowed you to only stay for 20 minutes. For reals? LOL"
"5.0","Reviewing Bea's is like reviewing a friend. I literally go to this place every single week for Taco Tuesday. Been going for a year. Somehow, someway, I haven't gotten tired of it. That alone should tell you how I feel. They did bump up the prices recently, but it's still very reasonable. While I haven't tried the entire menu (dietary restrictions), I can suggest the following:* Ranchero Burrito - delicious, tomatoey goodness. Only recently replaced as number one in my heart by...* Black and Gold Burrito. Heaven. Their mole sauce is so, so good. * Tortilla Soup - the variety with chicken can be a bit salty, but a great side dish.* Enchiladas con Mole - Like I said, bomb Mole. Delicious.* Veggie Tacos - I get these 75% of the time and I'm somehow not sick of them. Love Bea's. Stop by. You won't regret it."
"5.0","By far the best Capital Grille experience from all the cities we've been to. Pittsburgh's Capital Grille provides the highest 5 star steakhouse experience. The food speaks for itself, but the service and atmosphere of the space have made the dozens of times we've eaten there consistently amazing. There is no better steakhouse experience in Pittsburgh, and one of the finest in the country."
"3.0","It was hard to enjoy the food, that was actually really good, because it was so warm inside & the juice we ordered wasn't even cold. The table and floor was sticky as well which sucked some of the joy out of the experience. I'd give the food itself and the menu 4 or 5 stars, but there were a few other elements that bumped it down for me!"
"1.0","This was a sub-par experience. We were surrounded by unset dirty tables. The potatoes , asparagus, and corn Chile tasted off. I was not impressed and rather regretful that I didn't just go to the Outback Steakhouse."
"3.0","I must agree with Monique and say that for this review I wish we could give half stars- because this place would be a 3.5 for me. Alas, that's not how the game works, so I have to fall on the side of 3 rather than 4. The primary reason for the 3 star is simply because I've had better Thai food in Pittsburgh. Second, I (like others have said) have hardly tasted Thai food I haven't liked, so I control my Thai food bias by using the metric of comparison to other Thai joints. Nonetheless, this is a nice place to sit and enjoy some well made food in a place that has a bunch of character. I've eaten here many times with friends, and I definitely prefer this place over Thai Cuisine right down the street. These guys do a mean curry, and the staff have always been very friendly to me. I'd recommend that people stop in if they're in the area and looking for good Thai."
"1.0","Really bad Italian food. Probably the worst I've ever had. The worst American version of Italian food."
"2.0","For some reason this is the only brueggers in Pittsburgh that does not toast their bagels. They may 'warm' them up, but they are never toasted. This has been for over a year so it was just not a mistake once or twice. Completely ruins the bagel. If this wasn't the brueggers on the way toWork, I would never stop at this one.When I called to complain the man who answered was less than helpful and thought it was a joke. He asked me if I 'watch how long they toast it for'.. Sorry I did not babysit my bagel was it was being made. That should not be necessary.The only reason I give 2 stars is because the employee was nice today and the cooler was cold. Which it typically is not."
"3.0","Great service... Great drinks.. Awsome yakitori.. However the deep fried katsu bone Inn over rice and  assorted slaw stuff was way out there.     And too sweet mos6 of the main entrees looked too done. Up, I can only attest to what I ordered. Grew up in Japan. So maybe I'm more traditional.   Other wise good vibe. Go eat dinner somewhere else but have a drink and a yakitori here."
"3.0","The location is nice and it's a neat place to sit outside on the deck to enjoy a nice day. The service was fine as well. The food was very average. It wasn't bad. But it wasn't good enough to make me want to eat a meal there again. I got the shrimp and crab pizza at the waitresses recommendation. It was average. Good crust and cheese, but the shrimp was below average and a touch chewy. Maybe I shoulda got crab legs like everyone else.:/"
"4.0","Very trendy atmosphere where the food and brews are all local sourced. Great selection on tap! Not surprisingly they specialize in burgers with some terrific choices and a build your own if you don't find one to your liking. I had the 'Mexican War' with its great buttery taste and some heat. The pierogis as a side were fantastic. Don't sleep on the fried chicken either. It too was a pleasure. Prices very reasonable."
"4.0","Freshii is a great healthy lunch option for anyone working up on Grant St. Freshii offers bowls, wraps, salads, and smoothies. While the prices are on the higher end, the ingredients are quality and noticeable. I prefer the bamboo bowl and the sauce adds a ton of flavor and keeps the bowl from being 'dry'.  If you are looking to order a smoothie, I would not order as my meal. Although the price is high and indicates that it could be a standalone meal, it would not be filling enough."
"5.0","This was an amazing Gem right outside the Steelers Stadium. Incredible service by George. He recommended a lot of delicious items since it was our first time here. We will definitely be coming back every time we get the chance."
"5.0","The over-all experience was very enjoyable. The food is great, the service is phenomenal, and the employees are really nice. Also a great vegetarian menu."
"5.0","Wow. How delicious. I came here randomly after a day of walking around Lawrenceville and got the Shiitake small plate and the Cashew Cheese (w/ Rasperry) toast. I also got coffee with almond milk. Everything was amazing. Such a great community feel. Lots of street parking. Friendly staff. Definitely check this place out even if you're not vegan! It wasn't busy Tuesday at 11am, but I'm sure that this place is usually packed."
"4.0","In the few weeks that I've been in pittsburgh, I have already been to this place twice.  The environment of this 'cantina' is distinctive; tucked in the corner of a peruvian arts store, and co-owned by the people who own Pamela's, this place has 'hit' once, and 'missed' once.  They do have a very basic menu which doesn't change, but the items on there are those that you can pretty easily make at home.  The daily specials that they have are the ones that are a bit more elaborate, and come with a few sides, such as rice and french bread.I previously thought that peruvian food was simply chicken and rice.  Although this is still the main two ingredients they use, this restaurant has definitely changed my perspective on how many different ways they can prepare chicken.  The first time I went I got a 'ropa vieja', which was a very simple meat-only sandwich.  The second time I went I got a chicken dish that was mixed with dried fruits: that was delicious.  However my fried ordered a grounded pork dish that ended up tasting like glorified taco meat.  Unfortunately that didn't make for a great first impression.Overall, be wary of what peruvian food specializes in, and order accordingly.  Service is very friendly, and food comes out in 5 minutes because everything is bascially premade at the beginning of the day."
"3.0","Not what I expected.  When you call yourself the an oyster house, I expect oysters galore on the half shell and not just shooters and fried.  It was good though.  It is a bar and take out or quick eat in joint.  The coleslaw was very good and we did enjoy our meal with the crusty attitude."
"1.0","I found a short black curly hair in my basket of fries... and it was definitely not mine.Needless to say, this completely ruined my meal. Thanks to Peppi's, I won't be eating anything that isn't ready-to-eat as is (like fruit) for the next few days.Not only does the shop LOOK grimey, it IS grimey... Completely disgusted."
"2.0","We visited here and were greatly disappointed in our service and the coffee was atrocious too. After being seated it took about 20 minutes for a manager to realize we didn't have a server. She finally got the server and it was horrible the whole time. Overall we were there for about two hours and the server took forever. First to get the drinks took forever, and we waited forever for the apps, and then the main dinner with no waitress in between. My coffee got refilled only once and when it did it was disgusting. The coffee had stuff in it, and the cream was the type that comes in the small containers and had floater chunks in it that you expect to get at dirty gas stations. When you are paying over 100 dollars for a meal please serve me good coffee with proper cream. They didn't have espresso nor good coffee. I don't think it's out of the norm to enjoy good coffee and espresso with an expensive Italian meal. The food was good, but I believe over priced. I would give better stars but the service and drinks ruined it.There are so many other Italian restaurants with better food, much better service, and ones that serve better coffee and espresso with real creamer  in this city. I wonder how this place is going to stay in business."
"5.0","Dined at Girasole with my husband & parents for my birthday. We made a reservation the day prior and were seated at 7 with no wait (they will not sit you until your entire party arrives). The space is small & intimate & there are tables in unique spots (we ended up sitting back near the kitchen). I frankly liked this the most, it felt like the most spacious area of the place. Our server, as busy as he was, was extremely attentive and informative on menu items. I am a picky eater with some dietary restrictions & I was really happy with how accommodating this restaurant was with menu swaps, without me getting into detail.My entire family ended up ordering the same thing - the rigatoni with meat sauce & I ordered the linguine with marinara & shrimp. Our meals were accompanied by salads also.The food was delicious, I think my noodles were made in house & were cooked perfectly, the sauce was great, and the shrimp was prepared perfect- not over cooked in the slightest. My family all seemed to agree that the ravioli was some of the best that they had ever had. I can truly say Girasole is one the best Italian spots in Pittsburgh. A restaurant that is constantly packed , even the weekend after New Years must be doing something right. It definitely has stood the test of time."
"2.0","An hour at Marios is like being inside an episode of Real World/Road Rules Challenge.There's people making out, fist fighting, throwing drinks, falling down etc. pretty much everywhere you look.If I was still in college, and this was the only place that would accept my fake ID, I would definitely go back."
"5.0","Stopped last night with my wife and some friends.  The staff was very pleasant and the manager made sure to come over to the table.  The waitress knew the beers and was able to explain it.  They had six beers on tap.  My wife and I decided to just get taster of all six.   The blithering hayseed was light and refreshing and very different.  The RAJ was unique but quite good. The IPAs were on the mark. And so was the stout.  They are very new so they do not fill growlers yet.  But can't wait to bring this beer home."
"2.0","This place needs to work on their customer satisfaction!  Great tacos but horrible people skills. Pay attention to when you have customers sitting at the bar and not to the football game on your phone!"
"3.0","While I AM a snob when it comes to chain restaurants - generally HATE them - and am a champion of the locally owned business, I actually enjoy eating at Buca Di Beppo at Station Square. I haven't an ounce of shame about this. Eating here is FUN. The decor is Italian-American kitsch on crack - every nook, cranny, and square inch of wall space is filled with some fabulously tacky knickknack, souvenir, gilt reproduction of Michelangelo's David, vintage family photo, or 8 x 10 glossy of Gina Lollobrigida and Connie Francis. And, honestly, any restaurant that has a table with a rotating head of the pope as its centerpiece can serve me a TV dinner in a tin tray and I'll be THRILLED. The food is better than that, though. It's not the best Italian food in town, or even the second or third best, but it's good enough. Entrees are served family style, so you have to share, and that's part of the fun too. It's super-crowded on the weekends, but if you can get a group together some week night, I promise it'll be good times. Service is s-l-o-w, so get comfortable and have another glass of wine."

"2.0","I normally love this place and go to the Western Ave normally. I happened to stop in this location on Saturday night at 730 and had the worst service. The man cooking was either too high or drunk to understand the order and didn't seem too happy about cooking yet another order. We waited an exceptionally long time for just two sandwiches and at this point were the only ones in the place. We finally get our orders and one of them were wrong and the other had so much mayo on it it was a sopping mess. I will never come back to this location again. Guys at Western Ave have their act together . This guy was the worst ."
"3.0","This is a quick and semi tasty food truck option. I enjoyed the blackened salmon tacos, though felt the salmon was so so, and was over powered by the cabbage. I also thought that the avocado cream dollop and sour cream drizzle is annoyingly placed bc it's more on the outside than the inside and sparse at best regardless... so you're basically a mess for an underwhelming experience.. would I order again? Probably.. bc it's local and convenient..  5 bucks a taco seems high to me... but it given competition reasonable."
"4.0","Yeah, I'm a fan. This was my first time to Cafe Raymond and it was a very enjoyable experience. We went to Sunday Brunch after church and arrived at about 12:30 p.m. to almost a full house. It's a long fairly galley style space with the ordering line and kitchen on the left side of the room and a long line of 2-person tables along the right side. The entire place smelled of delicious bacon when we entered and inspired my husband to order the BLT. I ordered a cup of hot tea and was given a cup of boiled water and shown to the tea station where they had several types of upscale tea bags in various flavors. I chose a traditional Earl Grey and it was a very good cup of tea - they also had lemon, milk and sugar for those wanting to doctor their tea up. I had read about the fantastic Blueberry Ricotta pancakes and decided I would try those; my husband got the BLT with roasted potatoes on the side and a delicious fresh crunchy dill pickle spear. The pancakes weren't the end-all and be-all of pancakes, but they were quite good. I will definitely be moving on to trying some of their sandwiches next time. During our time there I had the chance to speak with a couple of the lovely girls who work there and they were both very friendly and helpful. One of the best perks about this place is that they have nice restrooms in the basement with elevator (or stairs) access. This is important for me as I have mobility challenges and stairs are super taxing on me. It's great to find a restroom in the Strip District and especially one for folks who can't do stairs.I will definitely return to Cafe Raymond as we had a great Brunch meal and an all-round enjoyable experience."
"5.0","I absolutely love this new place. It is the best Indian food I have had in Pittsburgh by far and the staff is extremely friendly. Cute little place and very welcoming. Would highly suggest!!!"
"1.0","1.5This place is definitely aimed towards college students. The music is incredibly loud and you could barely hear your conversations; however, the atmosphere and decoration were pretty nice. As for the food, I would not come back to eat it again. The chicken was overall bland and flavorless, and you can only actually taste the heat. The french fries were below subpar and their waffles acted as a vehicle for syrup and nothing more. The service was good and you definitely got your meal fast."
"1.0","The absolute worst! The food is terrible and unfortunately the service is even worse. Want something to drink???? Then you better flag someone down. Want to actually order food??? Then you better wave them down again, cause no one is asking.  Want your Indian food to have spice and flavor??? THEN GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!! So even with all of this awfulness they still managed to get worse. When we brought it to the woman's attention that our food was poor she brought out , cold from the fridge sause and told us to mix it in our already cold food. This one sause was supposed to 'save' 8 entrées.....nice try. We then spoke to the 'manager' Who took $2 off of our meals, but then had the audacity to add automatic gratuity! Meanwhile.....all this time.....still not one persons asks if we want more drinks!!! This is Restaurant 101 people.  I'm still in disbelief of the poor experience we had there."
"5.0","I wish I lived closer to this place, it's got a ton of rotating artwork on the exposed brick wall, great coffee and a less-is-more seating approach - good amount of seating without being aggressively packed in. Lots of outlets, good music playing... feelin' like I need to make my way back here real soon."
"5.0","Delicious and authentic! There wait staff was friendly as soon as we got there. I've had Thai food before, but their menu had some extra items I'd never heard of. Unique dining area with pictures and decorations everywhere. Truly unique to Bloomfield. The location was easy to get to. Walking distance from my hotel. Tables were small and cozy. Great place for a date or hanging out with friends. The dining room had a lot of people, but it wasn't too noisy. I started with a soup that had lots of mushrooms and seasoned with shrimp. I don't like mushrooms, but this was good. There were a lot, but I ate most of them. My Pad Kee Mow was good, but spicy. The waitress asked and I requested level 5. My lips were burning afterwards.  i couldn't finish it all and my employee didn't either. It came with these good noodles that I've never had before. Definitely go here if you're in the area."
"3.0","This place was pretty good, and has the potential to be great.Pros: Great staff (our waiter was fantastic...I think his name was Peter?), good location, a different vibe than other Shadyside bars, high quality ingredients, fantastic drink selection (something for everyone), chill atmosphere, vibrant crowd but not too loud, and every course had some great offerings (good appetizers like the soft pretzels, solid sandwiches almost universally, and the white chocolate creme brulee was a very enjoyable dessert).Notes for improvement: (1) My chicken sandwich was great, but there wasn't enough cheese (it got lost under a large bun and in many bites I could barely detect it).  This is an easy fix: just use more cheese.  (2) The sweet potato fries were too salty, as if the kitchen didn't have enough confidence in their flavor.  Trust me, the flavor was great, and they don't need that much salt.  Side note: the sweet potato fries went great with the side of barbecue sauce my friend ordered, I would recommend the combo to any diner.  (3) One of my dining companion's burgers came out undercooked.  Pretty much every nearby restaurant will overcook your burger, so this was different, but if you want to be a top-tier gastropub you should cook burgers to temperature every time.  Use some trial and error to figure out a system, then stick to it religiously.I look forward to dining here again, when hopefully I'll up the rating to 4 or even 5 stars.  It's definitely within reach of being a top-tier Pittsburgh gastropub."
"4.0","This place is one of my favorite Italian restaurants! I went here for my birthday with my husband last week, I got traditional spaghetti !"
"4.0","Very good choice. The Pho was excellent as were the rice noodles with chicken.  Very simple place - you'll go for the food not the atmosphere.  Cash only."
"3.0","I would say that Fazio's is probably a small step ahead of Pesaro's. The pizza is a smidge crispier though delivery always results in a less crispy pizza than when you eat-in. I also like the steak hoagies. Service is quick and prompt and the food arrives piping hot. As others have noted - totally solid neighborhood pizza joint."
"1.0","So, we walk in and the guy seems upset we came in. My wife asks a simple question and he acts like she commited a mortal sin. The guy and his friends then have a conversation in a language we cant understand, laughing and looking our direction. The whole time Im saying please and thank you, smiling etc....polite as possible. Hes still upset with me, for an unknown reason. I gave a tip and left the store. Im telling myself, dont take it personal, hes having a bad day. Im then drinking my slushy and become convinced they added 3-4 times the recommended amount of artificial garbage powder they use. I drank half of it, and ended up with a potent stomach ache. Terrible."
"5.0","Very friendly staff, delicious food. French toast with fig & brie and nutella-cream cheese crepe were phenomenal!"
"4.0","Another place I finally went to, then immediately kicked myself for never having eaten here!Wife got the Grilled Lamb Pita, I got the Beef Schwarma Pita.  I got feta cheese, but on the side.  My wife does not like hummus, but her order came with it, so I said put it on the side.Long story short, every aspect of the entire meal was great.  The lamb was tender and perfectly seasoned.  Same with the Schwarma.  And the hummus, the wife finished it off.  It was smooth, and tasty, delicious.I am really used to hummus that is just a bit grainy, and  has a pronounced tahini and lemon flavor.  usually just on this side of bitter.  I mean, I like hummus, but I always assumed it was supposed to taste a little bitter.The hummus here was a revelation.  It was smooth and creamy.  And the tastes were so mild, you could taste all of the individual ingredients, but it all blended into a smooth delicious flavor unlike anything I have ever had before with hummus.  It was GREAT!The side of feta cheese was also something new and delicious.  And again, I was so used to feta cheese being hard, a little bitter, sharp tasting.  In this case, the feta was shredded.  It was smooth and tasty, and melted in my mouth.The lamb and the beef schwarma pitas were every bit as good.  This place usurps every other middle eastern pita or wrap I have ever had anywhere, ever, at any time, ever in my life.  Ever.I am off tomorrow as well, and am going to do the vegetarian thing.  In fact, up until now, my line had always been 'if all food was as good as Indian food, I would be able to be a vegetarian.'.  Now, the vegetarian thing includes this place.  I am going to update the review if I remember.  I was going to do Taj Mahal lunch buffet, but am coming back to Kassab's, and I am getting the sleek, the eggplant stuff, that parsley grain salad, etc (sorry, I dont remember the names of the items, but I know the ingredients!).Thursday.  Vegetarian day at Kassab's.  I can't wait!  YUM!"
"4.0","Momos and noodles here are really great. Their Chinese is more 'Indo-Chinese' and it's yummy. The Indian food is good but I'd go back here for the momos and noodles."
"2.0","The location of Redfin Blues is great! It overlooks the river, and makes for a lovely place to hang out and have a few drinks... However, the food and service is sub par. Each time that I have been here, whether it be an extremely bustling Saturday evening, or a slow weekday afternoon, the service has been poor. The food is average, and is way overpriced. There are many other great places in Pittsburgh to go if you want a yummy fish sandwich. Redfin Blues has the potential to be such a great restaurant! But with the poor service and average food, it has a lot to yearn for."
"3.0","This place was smaller than I had expected but the food is still very tasty! I went for the lunch buffet and it was only $8.99. I was deceived by the sign outside because it says student discount of 15% but when I went to pay for the buffet they said the 15% off doesn't apply to the buffet. The food was very good however we only got water in the beginning and end of our meals (which isn't a lot considering the food can be salty/spicy at times) so it would've been nice if we had some more water throughout our meal. Also, there was only one waitress the entire time and there is a minimum of $10 when paying with credit card (which is hard when you're just going for lunch!)"
"5.0","Best place in Pittsburgh to stop in for the perfect cocktail or full meal. Always new items on the menu keep it fresh with experienced bartenders to allow you a great night out. Always taking friends and family here when it town. Always worth the visit!"
"5.0","So good!!I loved I could call the day of and get a seating for 2 at a reasonable dinner time. The interior is dark with dim lighting but has a casual and intimate feel. Loud at the bar area but quieter on the dining table side. Here is what we ordered to share between two:* Roasted carrot salad* Crispy wings* Tagliatelle* Lavender pound cakeAll of which we loved!! The fried tofu in the roasted carrot salad was a pleasant surprise. The tagliatelle was rich so am glad we split - breaking the 1 hour egg just melted over the pasta and pulled pork. The crispy wings are on the salty side however I will say after we were done with the wings we asked for bread to sop up their yummy cheese oil garlic spiced concoction in the bowl the wings came in. The bread was thick, toasted and buttered so made the perfect accompaniment - there was nothing left in the bowl (or in any of the bowls we conquered)! And the desert made for a great ending.Staff were all incredibly nice and informative - we will be back soon for sure! We are excited a place like this has popped up in Bloomfield."
"5.0","Outstanding breakfast! Had scrambled eggs and chorizo hash....yummy! The hash was nice with a bit of spice, eggs were fluffy and cooked to perfection. Just be aware that they only accept cash."
"2.0","I had never been to the Bloomfield Stagioni, but when the new one opened on Carson Street, I went with a small group of friends to give it a try.  We went on a Wednesday evening without needing a reservation. However, I highly recommend making one if you plan to dine Thus-Sat. We ordered the mozzarella plate and mussels to start. While I've seen people rave about the former, I found it rather underwhelming for the price.  First of all, the mozzarella doesn't come with tomatoes, but instead with red peppers and olives (sorry, hate em'). The prosciutto was an interesting touch, but not enough to warrant this dish being the most expensive appetizer when it's just a glorified cheese plate. The mussels were good, but I've had better elsewhere. On to the main course. I chose the ricotta gnocchi (which at the time was served with sausage in a red sauce with parmesan. These heavy balls of dough don't come close to my beloved Dish 'gnocchi-pillows.'What I do like about Stagioni is in all of their pasta entrees, you can choose a dinner or lunch portion. I always find this helpful. Nevertheless, even with the lunch option, most dishes have generous portions. I've been back a few times to try other dishes and unfortunately I've seen their menu shrink in size. Not a good thing, especially during the summer months when so many things are in season! The service varies between friendly bartenders and apathetic waiters. To sum up, Stagioni pales in comparison to many of Pittsburgh's other small Italian restaurants."
"3.0","My second or third time here. The waiting time is a bit long like 15 min for a small drumstick with sweet and spicy sauce. I also had taro milk tea and french fries as sides.The sauce is light spicy which hits me right, but overpowering sweet, french fries a bit too salty. taro milk tea has as always too much tapioca that I cannot finish nor reach.The cashier is friendly. Two stars off for the mediocre chicken and fries and waiting time.Lesson for myself, good milk tea, but no need of tapioca it's a waste, unless I really crave them."
"5.0","This is my second favorite sushi place in Pittsburgh. Great sushi, very fresh perfect portions and service. Staff is authentic and courteous anytime I'm in station square this is my go to for sushi."
"4.0","I just want to throw in a quick review of this Domino's because of the terrible reviews I have seen. I work downtown and decided to pick up a pizza and a two liter of pop for dinner that evening. I placed my order online and the website said my order would be ready in about 20 minutes. Around 20 minutes later, I stopped over at Dominos to pick up my pizza and pop. The man who greeted me, the manager (I forget his name!) was very sweet and friendly upon m arrival. I told him the name for my order and it wasn't quite done yet. I'm naturally an easy going person, so I just took a seat to wait until it was done. Apparently the gentleman felt bad because of the wait so he said I can take a two liter of my choice home as a 'thank you' for waiting. He then looked at my order and noticed I ordered a two liter of Coke Zero.. Which they did not have in the store. So then, he told me to take about 4 Coke Zero smaller bottles since he had no 2-liters. I didn't have to wait much longer for my food, so all of that was not necessary. But I wanted to write a review, because the customer service was terrific and my pizza was delicious also! :)"
"5.0","Absolutely excellent sashimi & sushi They serve super fresh and thick pieces salmon and tuna. I will go back definitely"
"4.0","How have I not reviewed Salem's yet?  This place is great.  Falafel sandwiches are always good.  (Ask for hot sauce on it.  You won't be disappointed.)  All of the gyros and shawarma are very good except the chicken - tends to have too many chewy bits (i.e., gristle).  I've had their shish kebab once, and it was mouthwateringly delicious, and their appetizers are outstanding: baba ganoush, hummous, tabbouleh.  You can easily make a great picnic with a few of these.  (I've done it before.)The desserts are good, but nothing really special, for a Middle Eastern deli.  (Always a good selection, though.)Service is always friendly, but a little spotty on procedure.  Sometimes I feel like I'm being asked impatiently for my order when I'm obviously still deciding, and sometimes I feel like I stand there for a couple of minutes before someone helps me.  I feel guilty for being critical, though, because they are very friendly.Decor leaves a lot to be desired: just an enormous linoleum an drop-ceiling cavern with a few Steelers pictures on the wall.  (Bonus points for the garish, though colorful and friendly, murals on all of the exterior walls, though.)  Parking's a bonus, too: they have a small private lot that relieves the on-street parking, so they're one of the rare Strip denizens that doesn't require a parking space hunt."
"3.0","I really want to love Tamarind because it is right down the street from my boyfriend's house and he LOVES Indian food, but every time I give it a chance, something offputting happens. On Valentine's Day, the kitchen made a mistake on our takeout and gave us one order of Tikka Masala instead of 2. Now, we were looking for a romantic dinner, but sharing one order isn't exactly what we had in mind. That time, the Tikka Masala was really good, but since then, we've had takeout in which the chicken was almost spongey. I found it completely inedible. I think we'll give it another chance or two because it is close and has been delicious in the past, but if we don't and I never end up eating there again, I'll really be OK. And a $5 corkage fee? Really? That's just ridiculous."
"3.0","Chick'n Bubbly has decent fried chicken and bubble tea, but I have had pretty inconsistent experiences here in the last year. Most recently, they were out of drumsticks and 'have been for a few months' which seems like a big risk for a Korean fried chicken joint. Trying to keep an open mind and ignore the attitude from the cashier, we ordered the fries and medium wings in spicy sauce. It hit the spot, but it's just not as good as it was before and the customer service was absolutely awful, or rather, lacking. The girl stared at us the entire time we ate, letting us know that we were a huge inconvenience to her. It was not a great experience."
"5.0","Salem's caters to Pittsburgh's Muslim community and its halal restaurant runs the gamut of food from the Islamic world, from Pakistan to Libya. But folks of all nationalities and religions come here for their tasty, filling lunches. Being more partial to Pakistani food myself, I usually get their curry-and-rice special; you can pick up to three different kinds of meat preparations with either plain basmati rice or biryani, and the vegetable of the day. You HAVE to try the goat curry; it's rich and soulful with tender meat. I also love the creamy chicken tikka masala and the neon red chicken tandoori. It's huge and you won't need dinner after! The market is great for your Middle Eastern and South Asian specialties, as well as your various halal meats; I grew up eating kosher meat and I think halal/kosher meat tastes cleaner than regular meat. Also a really cool selection of sweets that remind me of my childhood with my nominally Sephardic grandparents.A fun gem in the Strip!"
"4.0","Great Kung Pao chicken! Nice cheap $6.50 Chinese lunch specials, but the test of the menu is great too. Their sushi is okay, quite healthy like much of what they serve, but kind of bland. Difficult to understand the servers but they're friendly enough."
"5.0","The staff here was so nice, and the food is delicious, it feels very much like a hometown place. I had a rueben and homemade lemonade and both were great!"
"4.0","This is the only Chinese food restaurant that's worth eating. It's overpriced by a lot. But seems clean and taste's good. You can get a main meal and rice for $15. Or you can buy rice on your own for at $10 for 20lbs."
"4.0","The idea of people going to restaurants and ordering things that aren't on the menu only to slag them ruthlessly for not having those items is one that has always confused me. I assume these cranks want to dislike particular businesses and have churlish fun doing so. Sammy's is nothing more than what it is, and I'm not sure why some diners can't appreciate it for that. If one wants the Big Apple delicatessen experience, one should board a Greyhound, and coincidentally, a bus station is blocks away from this Sammy's satellite. So go. Far. Away. Please. At Sammy's, you'll find adequate service, a mixed, civil, quiet clientele, old-fashioned tavern decor, and fine, fine sandwiches served in normal proportions. Are they really 'Famous?' I don't know, don't care, and hear no one 'raving' about Sammy's aside from its haughty, eternally malcontented detractors. Sammy's makes sandwiches and serves alcohol, soft drinks, and a few other things. Cope with that. Regardless, I still feel that Sammy's makes a fabulously fatty yet fragile and flavorsome corned beef, but they do offer other kinds of sandwiches as well, and for some reason I was feeling like having tuna salad en route to a Symphony X concert at Altar Bar one evening last week, so that was what I treated myself to. See, I often crave that chilly, mushy, rich, creamy, slightly crunchy tuna filling between slices of sturdy white bread from time to time, and Sammy's delivered it unto me without fail, building the beast to my specifications (white bread, lettuce, tomato, onion, American cheese, and mayo). And I'd never ordered such a thing from Sammy's before, either. So take a chance for you I did, the Yelp lurker, coming out happily unscathed.What I have ordered before is their luscious potato salad, and I ordered it again due to its abundance of waxy, yielding spud cubes, tenaciously velvety dressing, and whatever other good, good things comprise it.  A fat, cold obelisk of dill pickle completed my basket nicely and kept me going for the rest of the long, strident night ahead, so to me, the portion was adequate and destroyed Subway with a bolt of lightning. Including a tall cup of Pepsi, my bill came to less than 7 dollars. I left a dollar tip and was thanked by my server who told me to 'holler' if I needed anything else.P.S. Over two years ago, I reviewed the corned beef sandwich itself at Sammy's sadly defunct Lawrenceville location...http://www.yelp.com/biz/sammys-famous-corned-beef-pittsburgh-2"
"5.0","I had a preview of Station at a Yelp event close to a year ago and let me tell you this: I have been DREAMING of that roasted carrot salad since. Thrilled to finally have dinner here. Atmosphere. Understated and simple. Warm lighting and rustic mixed with industrial makes you just feel hip when you walk in. Cocktails classic with a twist. I had their version of a Manhattan. Served up with quality ingredients in a Marie Antoinette glass, imbibing could be dangerous. So smooth!! This can also be served on ice. Next I ordered an Old Fashioned. Just as beautiful. Cocktails are a bit in the pricier side, but worth the quality. I did not order the carrot salad. I know, I had been drooling in my dreams over it, but I was thwarted by the chicken liver mousse. Why, oh why?? I could have ordered all of the small plates. The mousse was divine. Beautifully smooth and ample in portion. I ate it all. ALL. Served with crusty oiled bread and pickled ramps. Friends had the carrot salad, wings confit and beef tongue. Nothing left on our plates. Next dilemma....entree. I love that there are few items on the menu, but can you put on something I WON'T like? OMG. The struggle was real to decide. I opted with the Tagliatelle. Divine! Which came first? The pork or the egg? I don't care. Their marriage is one that should last forever. Tried a bite of the cod and the look of the burger was mouth watering, too. Pork belly...I'm coming for you!Dessert. Yeah. I did it, so?!??! Popcorn Panna Cotta. It is a decadent and whimsical as it sounds. Sadly, if I could have got my head in that mason jar like a dog, I would have. Will I be back to Station? (Don't tell anyone, but I'm camped out here now.)"
"5.0","Pittsburgh is old. It's a dying city stuck in the rust belt. Some may say Pittsburgh is on the rise. I say it's risen, and Morcilla proves emblematic of Pittsburgh's Phoenix-like return. Morcilla crafts decadent meals that satisfy both the palette and the wallet. From the Lamb Meatballs to the date-soaked Chorizo, you'll be drooling over each bite. Your evening dinner decision has been made for you. Go to Morcilla and don't look back."
"5.0","One of the best indian restaurant in town. Tasty food at reasonable price. The only issue I found is that the restaurant gets crowded on weekends and the food takes a lot of time to be served."
"3.0","The Phips Cafe is decent. They have options for soups, sandwiches, and even some homey foods. Unfortunately, the quality of the food is to be desired. Most of the time I get soggy wraps or greasy sandwiches and I am pretty sure I can get that anywhere else in oakland for half the price. I gave them 3 stars because they claim most of their foods are organic but  overall the quality/price index is very low."
"4.0","I worked remotely from here one morning and thoroughly enjoyed it. They have a pretty good selection of breakfast sandwiches/brunch type sandwiches for a coffee shop in addition to the typical bagels, muffins, and yogurt. I opted for a brunch type turkey sandwich which was very filling and generous. I almost couldn't finish it so it's a great value for only ~$7. The coffee had a good flavor also. It wasn't too sweet which was great for me. The coffee was smooth and delicious. I love, love, love the upstairs loft. The upstairs is quiet and away from the noisy streets, but you can still enjoy the view and people watch. Music choice is really soothing - was a very 90s rock when I visited. They have great artworks by local artists for view and for sale.Delaine's has a great, mellow vibe. Food and coffee are both enjoyable. It's a great place to study, read, or hang out."
"1.0","Don't go here. It is owned and operated by an Indian, and as a fellow Indian I know when I see a cheap Indian. The owner makes the subs and tries to put as little as possible on the sandwich. Your paying money for the guy to half way fill the scoops with meat and sprinkle a few lettuce on. Food is good, Clean environment, Cheap Owner. Don't go you won't get your moneys worth."
"2.0","Another Pittsburg staple. Unfortunately, this was the one I liked the least. The staff here was super friendly especially when they found out I was a newbie. I opted for the cheesesteak and fries. The restaurant itself is small and they had good music playing. It felt kinda like a dive but it was clean enough (the bathroom was not). The fries came first and they were just alright. They desperately needed salt. The sandwich came out next and it was just okay. I've honestly had better cheesesteaks but what I absolutely loved was the bread. It was so fresh and soft. That was the best part for me and the only reason I would return."
"1.0","Stayed in the hotel for dinner because I was tired and wanted to get work done. Should have gone out. Ordered hummus appetizer and a salad with grilled salmon. Anything but quick. Appetizer took a long time, then the salad took even longer. Hummus was grainy and not very tasty, though the presentation and the pita with roasted peppers was Ok. When the salad got there the salmon was over cooked, as in smelling burnt and dried out all through. Wasn't crowded so no excuse there. Wait staff was nice, so there's a star.With some nice places so close to the hotel, just walk down the street."
"5.0","B52 blew me away. The restaurant decor is just beautiful, the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, and the food is magnificent. We started the lentil soup, which is definitely my new favorite soup in the city. We also shared the seitan sausage, hummus, baba ghanoush, and falafel - all incredible and very fresh. My friend and I both agreed that it was some of the best baba ghanoush we've ever had. Smoked eggplant is genius. The kombucha i tried and almond milk I had in my coffee were also great and I learned they actually make both of those in-house! We also tried some of their chocolate and I can't even handle how great it was on top of the rest of our meal.This is already one of my favorite places. So excited to have such an amazing vegan friendly restaurant in the city!"
"4.0","Was in the neighborhood...heard so many great stories on the soft shell crab bloody Mary's...photo attached. went to the bar...early afternoon...not crowded...had tell 3 people behind the bar. what I wanted...15 minutes later finally received my drink. I would say tasty...I order the tuna appetizer...that was good. was not impressed with services...the women behind bar where more worried about conversation with some guy. would I go back...maybe"
"5.0","Me and my boyfriend live right down the street and have ordered pizza from every pizza place on butler street. This place has the best!!!!! Yummyyyy I'm hungry."
"1.0","I had hoped this would be a diamond in the rough but I was thoroughly wrong. This was one of the worst restaurant experiences. The service was bad: the only server spent our entire time there sitting at a table talking on her cell phone with only short breaks to get us food. The food was inedible: the coffee was watered down, the water tasted of dishsoap, and the food tasted like it had been going bad. We didn't eat more then a bite of the food, just payed and left."
"5.0","really enjoyed the atmosphere, unique seating. had the stir fry udon with chicken & sweet chili chicken. tizers were good- really loved the tofu. general tsos was very good but was a bit overcooked. some of the pieces were difficult to cut bc the breading was so hard. a friend had the ramen & love it- would absolutely go back. didn't have any drinks, but would like to next time."
"5.0","Words cannot describe this place. Everything from the ambiance to the food to the workers is absolutely amazing. We stumbled in here right after a concert because we were craving some ramen and oh man did this place deliver. The ramen was to die for! I will for sure be coming back to try everything else."
"5.0","Little Italy Days- a MUST see when in Pittsburgh. Rather than eat the so-so food on the street though, my friend & I decided to have a late dinner at Alexander's for a delicious Italian dinner. We ordered the chicken parm with angel hair pasta and marinara and split the portion between the two of us. We also had a side salad, the wedding soup, and some bread with our meal, as well as a glass of chardonnay. The salad was delicious and we received a generous portion as a side salad. The bread was delicious and fresh, the wedding soup was divine and the chicken parm was incredible. Even with splitting one dinner portion between the two of us, we still went home with leftovers. It was delicious! Service was wonderful as well. You can't go wrong with Alexander's! Highly recommend!"
"5.0","THIS PLACE IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST. Seriously everything on the menu is fantastic and with all of the nachos and tots and hotdogs this place will please vegans and omnivores alike. The deserts and cheeses are ridiculously good."
"1.0","Hours said open until 9. I walked in at 730 and the woman working stopped helping the customers in front of her and yelled at me from behind the counter that she was NOT going to serve me because they were closed. At that point, I said that's fine and walked out because I was at a loss of how to react. The rudeness and lack of professionalism by the employee was very unfortunate because I had stopped in before and their product is pretty good. I'm thankful that I was turned away because I would not want to be served by someone with that kind of attitude anyway."
"4.0","Definitely a great atmosphere, authentic Japanese spot.  In fact, my first time there we sat next to a Japanese business tourist AND on the other side was a Japanese and American business entrepeneur team having sushi and asahi/asake; we really loved the environment and would recommend coming back here again and again.  I still say Chaya is better located and adds a bit more umph, but this place still rocks!"
"5.0","Really great quality tea. They also had lavender, a personal favorite that is not always easy to find. There are a good amount of food options and the environment is very cozy. Highly recommended if you're looking for a nice place to study with a cup or pot of tea. Came in on a Saturday afternoon and there were plenty of tables open with outlets nearby."
"1.0","Great selection of beer but quite possibly the worst most expensive hot dogs ever!  First time I went in sober and hated them then I decided to give it another shot while drunk.........still couldn't finish it which says a lot!"
"4.0","It cracks me up to see people whining about the portion sizes being large. This is a *family-style* Italian restaurant. Their dishes are meant to be shared among everyone at the table! The food is delicious. I have never been disappointed. My fiance and I came here last on our anniversary in March. My only complaint is that the desserts were a bit overpriced. But the food is good and the decor is lovely too."
"3.0","The menu is varied and has some interesting dishes. There are enough options to find a few things that appeal to you without being overwhelming. We went for brunch, where I got the salmon soft scramble. I wasn't the biggest fan of the soft scramble (kinda watery and tasteless aside from the salmon), but it was fresh and there was plenty of salmon in it. The breakfast potatoes that accompanied it weren't the greatest- kind of hard and not very flavorful. Everybody else though seemed to enjoy their food a lot, and I would definitely come back to try one of the other delicious sounding options on the menu.I did take off a star for service. We used the 'no wait' app to get in line and arrived at our designed time, yet still had to wait over 20 minutes to be seated. Once we were seated, the service wasn't much faster. To be fair, the woman waiting on us did seem harried so it's not like this was due to laziness, but still, it seems as though other reviews have noted the slow service as well so maybe they should hire more servers. It wasn't even a particularly busy day either when we went"
"5.0","Only came here for drinks around 9 Pm on a Thursday. Impressive bar and great service. Also the bartender knew what tf she was talking about with every suggestion and she let us know what was out of stock and good comparisons. We didn't come for food so can't give any reviews on that.But as an out of towner, I am so happy to stumble upon this."
"3.0","The best diner option in Pittsburgh is to get on the turnpike and go to Jersey. Pittsburgh diners close at 10pm and the menu is bigger at McDonalds."
"5.0","My friend had her baby shower in a private space here and it was amazing! The food was delicious and the space was comfy and classy! Be careful with parking around this location but other than that we enjoyed our time here!"
"1.0","Well, we were ready to just hang out and have a few drinks.  Bar was full so we stood next to a table that had one chair.  A very rude young lady with long blonde hair informed us this was 'her' table.  Ok, we will be ordering more drinks!  Then, the hostess comes by placing a sign 'please see hostess for availability'.  Ok, I guess we were too close to the table for the waitresses liking!! She could have said 'Hello!  If you all need another drink, I can take care of you!' But no, a quick admonishment and the 'sign'!  Needless to say, we did not want to stand right in the middle of the traffic flow so we left.  Had a great time down the street;  Sharp Edge.  Spent a lot of money on food and beverages.  We are also great tippers.  Too bad blondie!!"
"5.0","Pasha is the place for Turkish cuisine.  The owner and the staff are all so kind and helpful. The atmosphere is so comfortable, I feel like I'm visiting a lovely friends home for dinner. The food, especially the lamb is always cooked perfectly. If you haven't tried their breakfast you need to! Wonderful egg dishes and fancy crepes.  A must try if you are looking to escape from Pittsburgh, while you're still in Pittsburgh."
"2.0","The only reason I'm giving coca cafe more than one star is because the food was good (okay). But given the service, I will not be back. The restaurant was not busy while we were there, yet our waitress could not be bothered to wait on us. For example- my friend ordered a drink, and I asked for a water and..... but before I could add coffee to my sentence she was gone. I shouted after her that I wanted an iced coffee. 15 minutes later, no coffee and no sign of her at all. 20 minutes later she is pouring hot coffee for other customers, so I begged for a cup. She begrudgingly poured me one cup of hot coffee. Then charged me for an iced coffee (more expensive). So she heard me the first time but chose not to serve me. The food is good but not this good. I've talked to several other people after eating here who had similar experiences as well. Coca cafe- you need to make some serious personnel training changes."
"5.0","The best thing about Umami (besides the food of course) is the element of surprise. First you're walking up two flights of stairs and it's like where am I going and then you enter the restaurant and it slowly opens up to this trendy place that makes you feel like you're in New York City rather than Pittsburgh. There's neon lights and you're up a few flights and it's just like, wow this is really cool. Perhaps the best surprise, though, was that we sat at the kitchen bar (which I would highly recommend around 5:00 if you can't get a reservation) and we got to watch the chefs the whole time! It's just a direct view into the kitchen which was so so neat to watch.Everything on the menu was super interesting and very good. Each dish had its own flair. The menu almost reminded me of a tapas restaurant where it was good to try and share a bunch of different things (which believe me, you will want to sample everything on the menu). I had a great ramen there and the octopus balls were incredible. You really can't go wrong, though.Such a fun experience overall and I'm still in disbelief that this is the first time I've been here. We will definitely be back!"
"5.0","Every time I go to chikn I can always count on a quick meal that's also tasty. Didn't know what to expect at first, but even with roots, piada, and chipotle nearby this restaurant sets itself apart with a great staff and an easy menu. If you're in the Oakland area looking for food this is the place to stop by."
"5.0","a whole mf nut. i got the special & the chicken tacos. my mouth is still burning from the habenaro mustard but it's a good burning, a sensational burning. 10/10 would burn again. if you come here make sure that you get at least one special, you won't be disappointed. good music too, i ate tacos to some old blink 182. good for the soul."
"5.0","I went here for lunch today after learning they have an all-day breakfast menu. My coworker told me about this place.  I got a bacon, egg, and cheese bagel. I had my choice of a plain or everything bagel. I chose plain. I also asked for my food to go because I only have a half hour for lunch. I've heard that they take a while to make your food even if you call it in ahead of time. I decided to just go and hope for the best. I was greeted by a sweet woman who took my order. They also have baked goods there, so of course I had to get something to try. I got the Oreo blondie. I didn't have to wait long for my food at all... Definitely less than 10 minutes. My sandwich was huge with generous amounts of egg, bacon, and cheese. I will definitely be back to this place! I can't wait for the summer time so I can try their ice cream. Overall, if you are out in East Liberty, you should definitely check this place out!"
"1.0","Paid for a pizza I never got. Called the driver back after missing his call, he didn't answer. Called the store the next morning in the hopes of at least getting the pizza I ordered and they refused to do anything. Will never order from here again."
"5.0","LOVE this place. Their Japanese 'street food' is as authentic as you can get in Pittsburgh! Would recommend ordering lots of things to share since there are so many good options. Their kitchen is OPEN UNTIL 2AM on Fridays & Saturdays!! Great for grabbing some drinks and Japanese bar food late at night. They have a bunch of Japanese inspired cocktails, as well as a range of cheap to expensive sake. Definitely a place you're going to want to come back to so you can try everything!"
"1.0","Poor Service, long wait time, no internet, very limited seating. If you are not a local who knows the staff, I would not go to Cafe Cravings for coffee or breakfast. On my multiple trips for weekend breakfast (most recent being my last), my order was taken, and several people were served ahead of me. A wait time of 20 minutes for a bagel egg and cheese that bruggers manages to put together in less than 5 minutes is inexcusable and seems to be the status quo at this shop. The prices are reasonable, and the atmosphere is a decent attempt at hometown coffee shop, but if you are looking for good service, this is no place for an outsider."
"3.0","Food = 5 stars.  Wait time = 2 stars.Okay, I finally made it here.  My sandwich was amazing and excellent (more details below).  However, it took 41 minutes from order time until our two sandwiches came out, and it was just not that busy.The service was otherwise very good - friendly crew, easy going and helpful, etc.  But the fries came out in 10 minutes, and it took 31 more to get two, standard sandwiches.  That's just a bit broken.FOOD:  Excellent.  I got the No. 7 (a.k.a., 'the Roethlisberger'), and it did not disappoint.  The bread is a standout - so fresh, so soft.  The meats were great - a mix of ground beef and spicy sausage, served piping hot and just delicious.  I was unsure about the egg part, but it worked - it's not really a fried egg - more like scrambled on the flattop, and spread out flat, so it forms another layer.My lovely wife got a Pepper Steak, add mushrooms.  She rated it highly as well.  One note:  the cheesesteaks can come with lettuce and tomato if you're into that, versus without, as is more traditional for a cheesesteak.I will try again, but the 40+ minute wait (I really timed it, yes) could be a deal-killer.  Let's hope it was a one-off.  If so, I'll be glad to update my review."
"5.0","Fantastic service, and wonderful food and drinks. A must visit when you're in Pittsburgh!Pros:-The food!        Pigs feet and Cheeks: a very interesting dish rich in flavor and texture       Bacalao En Aceite: Salt cod w/fried garlic and olive oil. A bit salty but our waiter gave us    extra bread to eat it with. The garlic and capers added a lot to the dish! Very nice starter.        Oxtail: Caramelized onion and mahon cheese. Delicious! So tender and flavorful.        Chorizo: housemade with great pairings. My SO loved this dish!-An incredibly knowledgable waiter!-Great ambiance-Solid non-alcoholic drinks-Decently priced   Cons: -No differentiation between lunch and dinner menu/prices-Wouldn't get again:         Strawberry gazpacho: An interesting mix of balsamic and pureed strawberries, but not something I'd like to eat in a soup form. It was too vinegary and overwhelming. Our waiter took it off our bill for us."
"2.0","I ordered an entire pizza, and received a sandwich. What?? Cheap, and NOT the tastiest pizza place anyway. Only go here if it's your last option."
"2.0","Setting: 1:10 on a Tuesday afternoon. They close at 2:30pm and reopen later for dinner. I got a lunch special with a friend, which consisted of Tom Yum soup and a spring roll. The soup was unexpectedly spicy, slightly more than maybe a teaspoon of Sriracha. Spring roll was okay. They brought the lunch out within 5 minutes of bringing the appetizer out! But it was quite spicy to me (I got a 4 out of 10 on the spice scale). Of course, we're talking authentic Thai food. So it probably would have been more delicious to me if I was more spice oriented. I ordered the Chiang Mai Mee, which seemed to be coconut milk based, and much more sweet than I wished is was. This is how authentic Thai is made, apparently, so I suppose I'm more a fan of Americanized Thai. My friend's experience was subpar. She ordered a few dishes for her colleagues from the office, which were made quickly. But one of the dishes was incorrect (noodle dish instead of the rice dish my friend ordered), and waitress asked if we could come back later (probably around the dinner time, since it was already 2:20) to pick up the correct dish. At this point, my friend asked if they could just remake the one they made incorrectly, to which the waitress replied, 'Hey, we make mistakes too.' My friend didn't get the dish that she wanted, and she's not planning on returning. Overall, an average place to eat, but the waitress's attitude was uncalled for. They absolutely should have remade that dish for free. If you want authentic Thai food (and have the stomach for the spiciness), then you might enjoy this place."
"4.0","After an awesome time at The Candle Lab, we were starving! We found ourselves at Hambone's.... I was the only newbie among my group and it was a good time.  I'm not sure if it's the name or divey atmosphere but I was a little skeptical. Dive places can be hit or miss and this place did not disappoint! I got the black bean burger and it was sooooo good! I opted to add gouda and WOW, combined with the balsamic glaze and french fries, it was a wonderful meal. Our table of 6 was quiet for about 10 minutes as soon as our food was delivered. Not one peep. Not one complaint. Just the occasional googly eyes over each other's menu choices."
"5.0","I absolutely LOVE Tamarind's buffet. They have some of the most authentic Indian food in Pittsburgh, which a good mix of South and North Indian dishes. The last time I went there, I ate so much, my stomach nearly popped. :-)"
"5.0","This place is sooooo good I honestly can't recommend it more. I'm vegetarian and it's so nice to be able to order anything off a menu for once instead of having to search through for stuff that's not meat. Even non-vegans will definitely enjoy the food. The atmosphere is cozy and the staff is friendly. I've been here a few times and some of the best things I've ordered are the lemon ginger turmeric kombucha, cashew cheese wrap, and seitan kebab plate."
"5.0","I was really shocked I liked this place and even more that I loved it. We got together with some family for Easter pre-game and I was not happy we were trying this place but decided to try and make the most of it. And then a while later I was stripped of my socks when my meal arrived. I got the carb cakes and cheddar broccoli risotto and oh wow. The crab cakes were all lump crab deliciousness. The risotto was chessy yumminess. Even the salad was fantastic. It has beets in which my not appeal to some but I loved. The BF got the seared tuna, which is not for me but he thoroughly enjoyed. Two people got the sausage pasta and that was amazing. The pasta was clearly homemade, a lost art in my opinion, and the sausage was quoted as 'the best I've ever had' by one of the woman who ordered it. We didn't get desert because of the amount of Easter candy littering the table but I can only imagine how I would haw the tuxedo cake. The place is small and very quaint, with lots of interesting furniture, and our waitress was so nice and accommodating. I love the atmosphere which is the the din of forks on plates and some lite jazz or something playing in the background. No loud music and college students acting like fools. I cannot express how much I enjoyed this meal. I would highly encourage you to try it as well."
"5.0","Salems is amazing! They have the best nann in the burgh! I've never tried something there I didn't like. Would highly recommend it."
"1.0","Bad service and neglect from kitchen. Three out of four of us had incorrect food brought to us, incomplete menu items inconsistent to what the menu says. Waiter told us they didn't have the items to complete the food ordered and laughed and shrugged his shoulders. Upon receiving checks a mouse ran underneath the table. Do not recommend."
"5.0","This is my fav thai restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Compared to what I have tried so far, They have the most authentic thai food here, even better than the Thai Cuisine next door. I like most of their dishes (curries, noodles, soup), didn't try many appetizers though. Love all sorts of spicy noodles there! Pad thai is the best! Duck curry is also yummy. Be cautious, don't try 7 or above, because it can be really HOT!"
"4.0","Definitely a nice place to go for a date or special occasion. The space itself isn't too big and you're literally right next to your neighboring tables, but I didn't mind because it goes with the cozy, dimly lit, intimate atmosphere.  The service was also very good.  Since we were seated somewhat near the hostess station, we got to see several parties arrive and it seemed like there were lots of regulars and people greeted by name.  Loved the personal touch.Food is also good.  I ordered the pork chop and it was cooked really well.  Slightly juicy and flavorful.  Also, Sausalido is BYOB, so make sure to bring your favorite bottle of wine!"
"4.0","For Christmas every year my girlfriend is blessed by old Saint Nick with a slew of gift cards to local businesses usually near work or home. This year was exciting because we got $50 towards a visit at Luke Wholey's Grille. Obviously, we knew it would be different than the fish market, but curious to see how tasty things might be! We made our way down the Strip around lunch time so we were fairly hunger and ready to enjoy some free grub. Being that we had a gift card, it was a must to get an appetizer! Ball out a little, we thought! Decided on crab cakes, which were damn there perfect. The worst thing that can happen to a crab cake is too much oil, these were fried just right and there was fluffy crab meat all throughout. After that good treat, we were greeted by who I believe to be the owner, with our entrees. My GF got the Ahi tuna sandwich with a side of fries and I went with the Steel City lobster roll, also with a side of fries. We were both impressed with our meals! The amount of lobster that was on the roll was a pleasant surprise and my goodness how delicious and buttery it was. Me being me, I had to try a bite of my GF's tuna which was grilled nicely on the outside and just right in the middle. A great experience we had at Luke Wholey's and we do plan on returning sooner then later. Excited to try the dinner menu options and apps!"
"4.0","Great casual neighborhood Indian restaurant. I've come here semi-regularly over the past few months and have never left unsatisfied. First the place- the restaurant is in a Victorian style house, and is warmly decorated with nice paintings on the wall. It is nothing fancy, very casual, but it feels very welcoming. Easy to have a long relaxed lunch or dinner here.The food - solid Indian food. No bells or whistles, just solid cooking. The food feels like authentic home cooking. Very reasonably priced. The chicken tikka masala is always good, and I have a soft spot in my heart for their vegetarian dishes with okra and eggplant.The service - very friendly! Prompt and courteous.Tip- Come by for the lunch buffet! For just $9.23 (incl tax) on weekdays and around $11 on weekends. It's all you can eat, (including mango lassi! *drool*) and has a wide variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. Good option for serving larger groups too."
"4.0","Great! I was a really chill place to eat and relax. One of the few vegan restaurants in the area and worth checking out!"
"2.0","I also had high hopes. In fact I drove from wintersville for good sushi. Instead I got low end sushi for a high end price. The service was 5 stars so feel bad giving two. The. Food was one star. So 5 stars minus two stars equals really bad sushi."
"1.0","Food is ok, but service is bad. And then plenty of empty tables and they still let us sit in the bar."
"2.0","So I've been here a few times and it was great the first time, ok the second time, so we gave it a shot again thinking maybe they had an off night before. But it was so disappointing. It was my birthday and we had reservations, when we got there, there was an empty table for 4 and they said it was a 15 min wait , so we waited (only to be seated at that table). Then after we sat it took another 15 for the waitress to come open our wine bottle and bring us water. Thennnnn our food was pretty lackluster. My bf and I loved the JUMBO crab cakes and risotto before, but the past 2 times we went they got smaller and smaller. I was shocked how little they were tonight, like the size of medium 2 shrimps(don't call them jumbo when there baby size, then charge 25$). And the risotto was so watery. I was embarrassed that I recommended this place to our friends (as I'm writing this they legit just walked in from Wendy's bc neither of them liked their meal either). I never write bad reviews and feel bad doing this but what the heck sausalido, get ur stuff together. I'm not even going to go into how bad the bacon pickles were or the Gouda was..... but I felt like they're big fans of microwaves there."
"5.0","My favorite Italian place in Pittsburgh. The food here is consistently delicious and the servers are always attentive. Girasole has a seasonal menu, but it also has some staples, such as penne marinara and linguine rustic. In addition to the seasonal menu, it also has daily specials. I most recently had their special pasta, which was linguine with bison bolognese, roasted pepper ricotta, and roasted pine nuts. The linguine was a little on the softer side, but the bison was chewy and created an interesting contrast in texture. The meal also came with bread and salad (which I switched for wedding soup). The bread with olive oil and vinegar was my biggest weakness. The olive oil and vinegar comes in a little cruet and is the cutest thing. The bread was soft and soaks up the olive oil and vinegar very well.The restaurant can be very crowded, but all in all, the food is worth it."
"2.0","This is the second time I ate here. I won't count the first one as it was opening weekend and places usually need time to figure things out. However this time was not much better. The staff was nice enough however the food leaves much to be desired. I ordered the Grilled Chicken sandwich. With my first bite I realized it was cold. I asked the server if it was supposed to be cold and she said no. It wasn't warm at all. I opened the sandwich and it is clear that the chicken is not actually grilled, but was precooked and just thrown on the grill to get some dirty grill marks. I will post the pic if I can. Anyone who has ever grilled a piece of chicken knows what it should look like. The server offered to have the kitchen prepare a new sandwich for me but I did not have time to wait because I had to get back to work. Fortunately they took it off if the bill, but still...I did not try my girlfriend's burger, but she was not impressed with it. Overall a disappointing meal with overpriced drinks. It's sad that this is what is happening all over Pittsburgh."
"1.0","Pizza was left outside, delivery driver never. Called. The worst place ever when I called grub hub to get a refund they told me they would have to speak to this place. Has to throw the food away, never never again, let's hope they  make this right"

"5.0","I'm in love with Morcilla! Although I have unfortunately only had drinks once at Morcilla, it was a fabulous time. My friend and I sat at the bar, but I couldn't help observing the rest of the place - beautiful! To drink, I had the Park Guell - something about the ingredient jasmine caught my eye and I knew I had to try it. It was beautifully crafted and so refreshing. Additionally, because I'm a lush and tempted with a good time, I decided to try the Sangria Rosada, too.I would love to come back to eat some time soon!"
"4.0","Mario's is a perfect place to grab a bite to eat in the afternoon with some of your friends. I have ordered the burger sliders which were pretty good I've never had them before. I also ordered the salmon burger which was delicious I would definitely order that again. If you like honey mustard I think Mario's has the best honey mustard around. The service is always fast when I come here to grab a bite. They have a pretty decent happy hour on the week days! As far as the night life goes at Mario's for me personally it gets entirely too crowded like most of southside and there is smoking on the one side of the bar. Other than that it's a good place to watch a football game have a few drinks and eat."
"5.0","This is BY FAR my favorite place on the mount. Their drinks are tasty and the bartenders are friendly. If you don't see what you want on the menu, they will make you whatever you want. Be sure to stop in for happy hour! They have great food and drink specials."
"4.0","I had the salmon salad with the lemon ginger dressing and the fish bites.Both were delicious!Cocktails were not great, Definitely don't need to have the Old Fashioned and the Moscow Mule was just okay. I would stick with beer.Great atmosphere and service."
"4.0","Went to Grille 36 last night in Pittsburgh.  A nice big sports bar near the stadium.  Decent beer selection, decent food, very good service from LynnAnn.  The place is nicely decorated with tvs everywhere to watch all the sports you want.  The bar is lively and fun. We ate in the more mellow back section with our own TV. That was cool. The food was decent.  My first fried deviled eggs.  They were pretty tasty.  The salad was big but the lettuce was wilty.  The adult grilled cheese w tater tots was pretty good.  Despite being in the back we were constantly checked on by our server.  She made us feel right at home even though I live 3000 miles away."
"1.0","This location has the slowest service. I have an hour lunch and get back late every time. The menus were soggy and falling apart. The waitress didn't come check on us and was quick to leave the table. I never got a drink refill. Never coming here again."
"1.0","Adequate.  Don't be silly,  neither Mexican or healhy."
"5.0","Pleasantly surprised by the quality of food at Thai Gourmet! The pumpkin curry was absolutely amazing, which it quickly became my all-time favorite Thai curry so far. I haven't yet tried a curry quite this yummy. It was such a delicious combination of savory and sweet, but it was also very comforting and perfect for the cold winter day that I stopped in. As other reviewers have mentioned, the spice level at Thai Gourmet might be slightly higher than other Thai restaurants in town. I ordered a 4 spice level and it was quite spicy, yet it was still manageable for me. If you're not big on spice, I recommend ordering a level down from your usual. I'm really looking forward to trying other dishes here. Not only was my food delicious, but the prices were very reasonable. Definitely will be back! Hopefully my schedule will permit me to visit again sooner rather than later!"
"2.0","I accidentally got a yuengling after our appetizer. I just want to leave here as soon as possible. I do not enjoy club music at 6pm with dinner. Esp when the sugar bowl is on... Put the football sound on!! You're a sports bar!!! 2 stars for the pierogis BC they were good. Our bill came to 27$ and we came here for happy hour. Tho they forgot to give us happy hour prices. The waiter did fix it.. To then not give us the drink specials. Our bill was 9$ over what it was suppose to be. Staff was clueless. Atmosphere is weird, like they can't figure out if they want to be a Buffalo Wild Wings/ a dance bar with quick bites/ downtown tailgate bar."
"4.0","I was told this was the best chicken in town. I was told the truth. The chicken is so tender and juicy on the inside with the perfect amount of crunch on the outside. Very friendly and fast. I'll be back for sure."
"4.0","Note #1: CASH ONLY! Note #2: I saw a fellow diner break out a bottle of wine, so they must be BYOB.  Having only been to Tram's a pair of times when I worked at the now-gone-and-replaced St. Francis Medical Center, I recall their beef fried rice to have supernatural qualities; 'twas the very best I'd ever had anywhere. Kay felt like Vietnamese food last night, and since I hadn't been here in close to a decade, we popped in for a spot of food.Ignore the paint peeling from the walls. Take co-owner/server Thao Le Truong, his limited English skills, and his no-nonsense personality with a grain of rice. If anyone deserves to be living The American Dream, it is Mr. Truong. He is there to take your order, serve you your food, and get you on your way. He is not there to make you feel special, joke with you, or be impressed by you. Have some compassion for a man who has obviously led a more difficult life than his clientele of hipsters and yuppies (it was scarves, low-rise jeans, thick-rimmed glasses, and slender people galore Friday night!) likely ever will. Have some Vermicelli, with coconut milk and shrimp, like I did. Bite into the tight, plump, vibrant prawns, slurp up the soft noodles, crush the bean sprouts between your teeth, drink the milky broth, and experience edible, drinkable comfort from a Vietnamese perspective. Have some crispy, oily, richly-filled egg rolls as a starter. Dip them into that syrupy sauce I cannot identify. Enjoy. When we arrived at Tram's, we were disappointed at first since it looked to be too full at the moment to accommodate Kay and I, but as soon as Mr. Truong caught sight of us, he held up two fingers, scrambled about, and seemingly pulled a small table and two chairs out of thin air to seat us over in a far corner of the restaurant where we could see everyone without being seen.As far as Kay's 'Saigon Soup' went, I had to finish it for her and found that it went down easy on a brisk winter evening, filling my stomach with love. I'm certainly not a world-traveler who is well-versed in Vietnamese cuisine, but Kay and I both took pleasure in what we ate. Leave whatever pretensions you may have at home if you choose to come here and do the same.P.S. The service was acceptable, none of the staff, including Mr. Truong, were rude to us, and while the dining room won't win awards from interior design magazines, we didn't find the place to be 'dirty' either."
"5.0","The greatest margarita menu I've ever seen. The strawberry cucumber was my favorite. I also tried the mango cayenne and basil agave. All are amazing! I will never go anywhere else for one. The food was great. Left full and happy. Definitely a place to try and enjoy! The service was attentive and food came out quick."
"5.0","I love this place!  Everything that I have had is wonderful.  I had a Mario Hoagie and a cannoli during the Bloomfield Italy days.  Delicious, delicious.  The hoagie was huge.  Everyone in the store is like family.  This is a must stop for anyone visiting Pittsburgh. I have attended dinners and lunches and cooking classes at the store.  Each is special.  Each is terrific."
"5.0","First day in Pittsburgh I was looking for a bar that served good cocktails close to my hotel. The Summit popped on my search and it didnt disappoint. Daniel was our bartender and did a great job executing the drinks. My Gimlet and the Amabel were spot on. Food wise we had the Smoked Gouda Mac and Cheese (fantastic) Spinach Artichoke and Crab app (Good). Vibe was awesome and I would highly recommend to anyone."
"1.0","Worst buffalo chicken pizza I have ever had in my life. Biggest waste of money EVER smh. I ate half a slice of burnt pizza with dried up hard cheese and 'chicken' that didn't even look like chicken and threw an entire medium pizza in the trash that cost 18$. There was no sauce at all. This place is a joke. Had to order pizza from another place. Don't bother wasting your money here. AND delivery took an hour. I will be making sure none of my friends go here anymore. Don't wanna support this business. Hope it shuts down and a better pizza place opens up instead."
"4.0","First time to visit this iconic downtown Pittsburgh restaurant in the former Chinatown section, having only done takeout previous times. A classic, with the decor and also the hospitality including the comp hot tea delivered after you sit down. The sauces don't seem to be the type loaded with corn starch as typical of many Chinese restaurants. Freshly made steamed, handrolled shrimp dumplings were perfect. Szechuan Chicken was great as well with crispy vegetables in a light sauce!"
"5.0","We have eaten at Salem's a number of times. The food is quite good and the prices reasonable. There are dishes featuring goat, chicken and various vegetables. I especially recommend visiting during Ramadan for their Iftar buffet. Seating is family style at long tables. Other diners were friendly."
"4.0","Streets on Carson is a spot just a quick walk down the street that my husband and I had on our short list of places to try. We popped in on a cold afternoon, so the joint wasn't too busy. The atmosphere is very modern and has a great Pittsburgh vibe with the tables sporting local street names. The staff was attentive and friendly and the beer and cocktail selections are impressive. My husband ordered a delicious stout, and I stuck with water due to my current 9 month commitment to sobriety. The menu is fun, offering different small plates and sandwiches from different geographic regions. We settled on the poutine and the Korean BBQ bao buns. The buns...on point. The poutine, while very tasty, was a little too salty for us (we're salty enough). The sand which selections looked fantastic with a filet / cheese selection representing pittsburgh that I feel I definitely have to try. We'll be back!"
"4.0","I'm VERY picky about Indian food, and I like it spicy! I was initially nervous about ordering from POI after reading the previous (older) reviews, not to mention my failure to find good Indian food so far in da Burgh!  I'm glad I took the chance:) Delivery was as expected through grub hub, about 60 minutes after the delivery was placed. I added a comment to ask if they would 'please make (the food) very spicy.' And they did not disappoint! Usually my request for very spicy food (a 10 on a spice scale of 10) gets me something more like a 4 or 5 on my personal spice scale. I was so pleasantly surprised that the chole and aloo gobi were made both flavorful AND very spicy. (Literally brought tears to my eyes!) This, however is the kind of spice I like, so for those who can't handle it, be mindful of the spice scale- it's taken seriously! I'm so happy to have found Prince of India delivery and will be trying it again soon."
"5.0","When I moved to Pittsburgh 4 years ago from a bigger city I was bummed to have comparatively few vegan options, so I was super excited to randomly stumble upon an Onion Maiden popup on a bike ride one night, and even more excited when they opened a brick & mortar location. Everything I've had here has been incredible, their cashew cheese is amazing and their baked goods are out of this world. I, of course, had to stop by their booth at vegfest yesterday, and despite the heat and long lines, everyone working was a perfect angel. Thank you for paving the way in a city that's becoming more and more vegan friendly all the time!"
"2.0","Food is eclectic, which is fine, but I wish for more of a normal menu.  Somewhere I can get some soft pretzels or wings etc. with my beer.  Also, it's pricey.  Atmosphere is odd.  Feels more like a diner or soda fountain bar.  The small 2 person booths are really uncomfortable. Beers were nothing that stands out."
"2.0","Just checked it out for the first time. Kind of disappointed but it was five dollars for the shrimp basket I got. The shrimp doesn't have any flavor and just tastes like grease. I wanted it to be great because I enjoyed the reviews on here. I did love the atmosphere and the lady that waited on me was a doll."
"5.0","This was my first time at this location and we were referred here my a friend at work.  We walked in and the service was great.  We had some jokes with the staff and they made the experience fun.  The food was fantastic and the sandwich was huge and a great value for the price.  The decor was fun with old pictures and lots of Steelers stuff in the walls.  Also a ton of pictures to look at on the walls!   Great experience and great people and great food.   There are also lots of shops and fun things to do close by."
"5.0","I love Station!They have some of the best cocktails in the Bloomfield/Garfield/Friendship area, on par if not better than Apteka, Mixtape, and Spork.Their bar menu has some very affordable options, and a few great veggie options as well. The vegan sloppy joe is actually pretty great!Brunch here is perhaps the best brunch I've had in Pittsburgh. Dishes are plated immaculately, artistically, and with so much passion that it brought tears to my eyes. The Fried Sticky is just fantastic, with little shards of dehydrated fruit chips that add such wonderful texture to the dish. It's a fixed menu and a tad on the pricey side, but so so worth it if you're really out for a nice brunch!I've also come here for a team lunch, and they were very accommodating and allowed reservations, which is nice for a large group size.Lastly - I love the decor. It has a sort of 20's dark art deco vibe with modern and slightly industrial (but not overdone) feel to it. Noise levels are pretty tolerable as well."
"1.0","This. Night was awful. The service was awful. The prices were awful. The food was awful. If you like hamburger buns served to you two hours after your meal you'll like this fucking place... it is horrible"
"4.0","Thumbs down to Milkshake factory being closed for last day due to the  holidays but thumbs up for this great alternative! My daughter and I decided to check in here for a coffee and a latte. My daughter decided to go with what they call a sweetheart frozen latte with white chocolate and raspberry.  I opted for the brew of the day which was a Brazilian roast.The place was packed with people and along the walls were various artwork for sale. They have an upstairs area to sit but since we were under time constraints we decided to stay downstairs and enjoy our drinks at a long bar stool. Sandwiches and a couple of sweets are also available for purchase as well as smoothies, hot chocolate, and juices.My daughter really enjoyed her frozen latte. My coffee was a good medium blend. Was a bit piping hot that I burned my tongue a little. Still you get a lot of bang for your buck. Coffee was very good. Free WiFi is available here for the many I saw working on their laptops. They have a assortment of expressos to choose from.  Makes a great place to unwind while you're in the heart of Southside's business district."
"4.0","Stopped by the market and had to have lunch.  What a treat!  Look at the menu board and get in line.  Most items for a meal are $10 or less.  You can get a half portion.  My Chicken Tandoori over rice with Spinach Paneer was so flavorful and enough for 2 meals.  If you are in the area, don't miss it."
"2.0","Cool venue I was really looking forward to going to. I travelled from Virginia and recommend to my friends as they had a great happy hour. When we arrived the menu was printed with the happy hour menu and times and then we get told 'they are not doing happy hour that day, we've been open since 2' I really had no idea what that meant but it was extremely disappointing as we got there exactly at 4 to partake in it. This place has a lot of potential as Emporio downstairs has great service and delicious food."
"4.0","Feeling hungry during the lunch time and decided to try this place out considering of the good things I heard from my colleagues. The restaurant feels very clean and fresh and modern. I ordered the Yuva lunch because the server recommend it and it just hit the spot. Creamy chicken tikka masala, fresh salad and warm soft naan. Worth coming back and trying the rest of the menu."
"4.0","I get cravings for their vegan sloppy joe! The lunch menu can be perceived as limited but it's all very tasty. The local grains salad is slightly better with a lemon vinaigrette vs the maple one but that's only a slight critic. Dinner menu is interesting and time has been invested in being creative without trying to be artsy. Gorgeous panna cotta dessert.Service depending on the day can be slow if you're in a hurry. Inventive drinks menu and it's a lovely place for happy hour. Parking is on street and easy to find."
"4.0","Cappy's is a rarity on Walnut Street: it's as close to unpretentious as you'll ever get in this affluent and often snooty shopping district.  As others have noted, it's a dive bar that happens to serve pretty decent food; my wife thinks that the Big Mountain sandwich is to die for (and I'd agree).  The service has always been friendly, and it never seems to get as loud in here as it gets in some other places (Shady Grove, I'm looking at you).I know it might sound strange, but one of the things that I appreciate the most about Cappy's is that it treats its waitresses as waitresses, not as sex symbols.  I've always found the skimpy outfits that waitresses choose to wear (or are made to wear) at some other places to be rather insulting -- these women are there to do their job, not to be ogled at by everyone in the area.  So thumbs up, Cappy's, for treating your female employees with some respect!My wife and I moved away from the Shadyside area a few months ago.  Cappy's is the one thing we miss.  Big Mountain forever!"
"2.0","Expensive mediocre food. Ordered 2 veggie omelettes and the bill was about $25. There was nothing special about the omlettes. You can go to any diner in the Strip and get the same food for half the price."
"5.0","Best burger I've eaten in ages: intelligently conceived, perfectly cooked, flavorful and tender beef served on a bed of mildly sweet, rich onion jam, smothered in Asiago fondue (which, sadly, is not sold by the vat) and topped with a deliciously crunchy onion ring.  The brioche bun was a nicely complementary vehicle.  Flavors and textures galore!  Service at the bar was friendly, attentive and courteous, atmosphere is 'comfortable upscale' and there are delights on the wine list.  Thank you!"
"5.0","Everything we eat was fresh and tasty! They have some wine and a few delicious brews from Peak Organic Brewery!"
"4.0","This place is fantastic. The wife and I swung by for sort of a in between lunch and dinner snack and we were not disappointed. First of all, the atmosphere is very cool. This is one of those places where you go hang out with your friends on a lazy Sunday afternoon.The sweet potato chips have been a great discovery for us. They are so crispy and taste amazing with the side of fresco. We also got three empandas. They were all more or less tasty. In short, I'm a fan. I'll be coming back to try out more stuff :)"
"1.0","Service takes forever, food takes forever, not worth the wait. Got the chicken tikka masala, unlike any curry I've ever had. Creamy, salty, doesn't seem like any attempt at authenticity was made. A disappointing contribution to the lack of even semi decent Indian restaurants in the area. As"
"3.0","My husband and I dined at Sausalido with friends and everyone was pretty disappointed with their meals. As an appetizer, we ordered the baked gouda, which was breaded (?) and not very tasty.  I ordered the evening fish special, which was bland even after I spread the accompanying curry butter on it.  My husband ordered a different fish, which was heavily battered, though not described as such by the waiter.   On the bright side, my meal was relatively healthy and Sausalido does permit corking.  Aside from the intimate atmosphere, there isn't any reason I would return."
"4.0","Rocky's breakfast food is exactly what you would cook yourself. For $5 this Saturday have someone else make you eggs, bacon, toast, home fries and coffee.  Feel like you're in your grandma's living room. Really, try it."
"3.0","I want to like this place but I never leave super impressed. Bloody Mary's are okay but can get pretty expensive with ad ons. They offer oyster Bloody Mary shooters, not my thing but maybe it's yours. Shrimp po boy was just okay. Lobster fries are good. I heard their sushi is tasty but a little pricey."
"4.0","Ambions-Nice for gora chamda's- brown chamdas look else where! I'm serious, you will not like eating at a neat & clean place like one of those stylish service and quantity of those of peasantsFood-Nice level of spice and don't forget to mention that you want Indian spice.Overall- I might check in if I'm in that area"
"3.0","It's a nice hole-in-the-wall bar with a pretty good food selection. The happy hour prices are good, but only include a handful of ales (and I did not know that the beers I ordered were not on the happy hour list - my bad). The food is good, not great - typical bar food."
"4.0","I stopped in for lunch and it was busy-- about 15-20min wait from the time I walked in till I got my order, but let me tell you, it was worth the wait. I had the oyster sandwich, clam chowder, and calamari. The oysters were very tender and I only wished the sandwich had a few more on it, cuz it wasn't very filling. Good thing I had the soup & calamari.. The clam chowder was sinfully delicious, with a heavy cream base and tons of flavor. The calamari was okay, nothing to brag about, but the sandwich and chowder couldn't have been better. The oyster House is split up into two different restaurants next-door to each other.. To the right side is a sitdown restaurant with a bar and the left side is a casual quick stop shop with a counter to order at (which is where I chose to go). The interior is a bit dark & outdated and it doesn't have much of a welcoming atmosphere, but the outdoor tables in Market Square are a great option, weather permitting."
"2.0","Okay... normally I like Mitchell's- but today they had the Corn Beef and Cabbage/Potato special for St. Patrick's Day.  Well the cabbage and potato were just boiled with no flavor and the corn beef was lunch meat probably cooked again-now has lost all flavor.  I was so disappointment.  And I hate spending money on food that just is not good.  Sorry.  Thank goodness I had hot sauce and pepper."
"5.0","The food is really as good as it gets for Vietnamese cuisine. Their soups are very flavorful."
"3.0","I'm glad I was finally able to check this place out recently. A group of us stopped in on a Friday evening for dinner and drinks, and had no trouble getting a table quickly even though the restaurant was fairly busy. I love the large and open space, and the windows overlooking the street below. The garage doors were open and the space was nice and breezy. I started by splitting the eggplant involtini with a friend along with a delicious red blend. The dish was essentially a 'fancy' mozzarella stick with eggplant inside--and I mean that in a good way. The dish includes only two of the little rolls, so we probably could have ordered another appetizer along with it. My friend and I decided to also split a pizza, and we ordered the picante salami and peppers. The salami and banana peppers were delicious and perfectly spicy. I actually tasted some spice in the sauce as well--I'm a lover of spicy foods to no complaints here. We were quite hungry before dinner and had no trouble demolishing the whole pizza between the two of us, but you could probably get away with splitting it three ways if you are also having apps/other dishes.I'm only giving three stars because the service was bizarre. I appreciate when waiters and waitresses take the extra step to educate you about a restaurant, its menu, and what they have to offer; however, I felt like it was taken too far and the whole experience was condescending. It was sort of like being a child and having someone explain how to read a menu to you. Also, someone at my table had a nut allergy and asked about a possible accommodation--she was immediately told 'no' without any hesitation. Once pressed, he finally went to ask the kitchen and came back stating that it would be perfectly fine. I understand that some things are premade and cannot be changed, but this was a really basic request and the kitchen clearly had no problem with it. So why not go ask before aggressively telling us no accommodations can be made? On that same note, they give you small pieces of biscotti with your check (we loved this detail), but the waiter made an unnecessary comment that 'he didn't bring a piece for (the person with the allergy) because they contain nuts and he doesn't want her to die.' Thanks for remembering and giving a warning, but maybe next time try to tone down the passive-aggression.Overall the food and space were great. Service, well, I think we just were not so lucky that day. I will probably give it another try."
"1.0","Omg we came here for a quick lunch today the wings were so bad I nearly gagged . Salads were bad too ... how is that even possible"
"4.0","Stopped by for a quick bite at lunchtime. The buffet has a variety of delicious food. My favorites were the aloo gobi and the samosas. The staff are friendly and the restaurant is clean. A very enjoyable experience.BTW, by noon this place was filled to capacity! And on the way out of the restaurant, there was a guy from the restaurant playing on a drum to 'drum-up' business!"
"5.0","My daughter introduced us to this place.  It is very small with limited seating, don't let that deter you.  This are the best tacos in the area.  They have flour or corn tortillas and daily specials.  I always get the special and I am always glad with the choice.  There are meat and veggie options.  One of my favorites was a cauliflower taco with a pineapple glaze.  This is a hidden gem in Pittsburgh's Southside."
"4.0","Good food, large portions. Spice level a little higher than what I am used to...glad I ordered a 4. It was more like a 6 in other places. But delicious! Pineapple Curry and Mussaman Curry were both really good. Nice prices, too! Will be back."
"4.0","We went on a late Saturday morning. We waited over an hour for a table, but you know if there is a line at a cafe, there is a reason. We sat in the back at a funky 1960's repurposed booth, cleverly cut in half. Love the interior.We started our morning with fresh squeezed juice, Carrot orange ginger, so tasty. The cafe was very busy, our food took a while to be prepared. My omelette arrived. It was a wild mushroom, gruyere, and spinach omelette topped with ramp pesto. It was a huge portion, cooked perfectly and served with seven seed toast. I took a bite of the omelette, the ramp pesto stung my tongue with oxidized garlic, it was very strong and very fresh. The toast had a weird flavor, perhaps a seed I am not familiar with or it tasted like mold? I am not so sure. My handsome hunk of a husband had an omelette as well. He ordered the avocado, apple bacon, jalepeno muenster omelette topped with fresh salsa. His omelette was served with deep fried home fries. His omelette was also massive and mouth watering.The server was having an off day, she never refilled our waters, or checked our table before breakfast was served. I had spilled a bit of my juice and did not have a napkin to wipe it up. A young man arrived with our food and was kind enough to bring us silverware and napkins. When we finished our breakfast, it was past noon, she could have tempted us with dessert, but did not offer. I would assume they have fabulous dessert. We will return to Coca Cafe. I will try the seven seed toast again to confirm my suspicion."
"5.0","This is a great addition to the neighborhood. Fast pizza, very reasonably priced and excellent ingredients. You can get unlimited topping for 8 bucks...pretty hard to beat. An awesome option for a quick cheap bite in Lawrenceville."
"4.0","After learning that there was a 45 minute wait at Spaghetti Warehouse,  we opted to go to Luke Wholey's.  We chose to to sit at the bar and ordered a couple of drinks. We studied the menu and decided on an oyster appetizer (all the hubby.... & at 1/2 off).... Lobster Mac n cheese,  provolone wedges & chicken poppers with Buffalo sauce. Everything came out in a timely manner.  Jayme (the bartender)  was friendly without being over bearing. The hubs loved his oysters & lobster Mac.  I really enjoyed my provolone wedges & chicken poppers. I was honestly full on just the cheese wedges!  There was a young man shucking (is that the right word?!)  oysters and the owner must not have liked how he was doing it because he came over,  scolded the kid and started doing it himself.  It was really unprofessional,  especially because we were sitting less than 3 feet away and could hear everything! We will be back..... But not because of the owner,  but rather for the food and service."
"1.0","I really liked Cafe Raymond, until this morning. I walk in, and take a seat. I am waiting for my mentor to get to the place. They come and tell me I can't sit unless I order. So, I say, I'm waiting for my other party, but I'll take some coffee. There is literally 10 open tables in the place - only 1 being occupied - a d they tell me I have to order food in order to sit down. What?!?  So I ask, so that means I have to stand up until she gets here? They reply, 'yes.' I can't even believe that. So, I leave. To be told I have to stand when there is NO ONE in the place is ludicrous.  That'll be my last time going there."
"5.0","Chef Nathan had me at first bite!  Great dishes, unique flavors.  Where does Chef Justin comes up with these amazing creations!  Love being back in the burgh!I can't believe that I didn't take a picture of the artichoke.  The best I've ever had!  That speaks volumes since I lived in the artichoke Capitol of the country!"
"1.0","Everyone that works here is rude as fuck. Do not come unless you want your day ruined."
"4.0","Love getting lunch at this place when at work.  The workers here are super friendly and fast with getting through tons of people throughout the day.      They open early and serve some great breakfast options like their breakfast burrito.  For lunch they have a daily menu, which usually includes 3-4 hot dishes served buffet style, as well as a daily specialty sandwich and/or soup.  They also have some items that are sold daily such as pizza, fries, tots, salads, wraps, hoagies, and more.  Thursday's are my favorite days because it is buffalo chicken wrap day.  The line can get long for this day because it is a crowd favorite so you might want to avoid peak time.  My favorite thing about this wrap is that it is simplistic, but still delicious.  There is not much that goes into it, just some delicious chicken tenders, tasty buffalo sauce, chopped celery, and your choice of blue cheese or ranch.  So easy, yet so satisfying."
"2.0","I tried their food this summer when they had their food truck in squirrel hill and lets just say I'm not wowed. I thought it would be a nice meal consisting of all my favorite foods, but instead I felt like I was eating olive oil with a side of greens and beans. I feel like it would've tasted great if there was only 1/4 of the amount of oil placed in my meal. I won't be searching for them again. However, if I happen to see the truck again, I would like to try their tater tots."
"4.0","Sometimes the holes-in-the-wall have something the pretty places don't; in this case, Sorrento's Pizza is that old, dank place that you'd normally pass right by, but if you give it a chance you'll be amazed.If you're tipsy or simply out late at night, this place is not to be passed by... not even for the competition down the street. Unlike the latter, Sorrento's has indoor seating which comes in handy in the winter, I'm sure!The pizza is great. I've paid $15+ for a pizza that was far below the taste, quality, and speed of the $5 pie at Sorrento's!A perfect end to a great, inebriated, or just long night is simple: Sorrento's!"
"5.0","Imagine the surprise of discovering a great place for Bengali food in Pittsburgh. This is a cozy little place on Atwood St. Staff was warm and recommended great dishes. I had the boneless lamb biriyani. Well cooked soft pieces of lamb in spicy rice with raisins. Raita (yogurt salt and cucumber pieces) on the side. Excellent meal. My friends ordered paneer and chicken tikka masala. Those tasted great too. Overall a great cozy place for a quiet dinner. Biriyani is a must try. Staff is friendly and recommends the best of dishes."
"4.0","Comforting ramen that has a few flaws like making the pasta too Al dente. I do like all the options available to add and customize the ramen. Get the butter bomb if you can and definitely add the crispy pig ears. I can't say definitively that one ramen is better than the other, so I guess what I'm saying is you won't go wrong. Overall this is a cool spot. I'd like to see them step up their cocktail game, a bit."
"5.0","So simple, yet so good. Simple is not bad yinz guyz... prime example here! Five different tacos to choose from and a handful of sides. I tried the carnitas and carne molida and both were fantastic. You also get the choice of a flour or corn tortilla... which I'm sure you authentic Mexican food seekers will like! Just thinking about them makes me hungry! I probably could have done one more if I didn't order up a side of black beans. And it's not just black beans... it's black beans topped with cheese and salsa. I don't think you could squeeze in anything else in this shop because it's TINY! They have a bar to sit around for probably around 10ish people, so don't come here with a big group... unless you're taking your tacos to go! All tacos are $3 and sides $2 which is a TOTAL steal! If I was in the South Side everyday, this could become a problem (but is that a bad thing!?)!"
"5.0","Best trivia in Pittsburgh, but get there early since it fills up quickly and there's not too much space. Friendly service and good drink specials. Definitely my favorite martini in Shadyside."
"3.0","2.75 The bagels are just alright with nothing really special to offer. The wait staff was very polite and friendly, and the atmosphere felt homey. However, what really affected this rating was the fruit cups that they arrange and sell at the front register. Much of the fruit was rotten (i.e. the strawberry slices were growing fuzz, the blueberries were squishy, the cantaloupe was discolored, etc.). I don't think that I'll be returning anytime soon, but if you're in the need of a quick bagel, this would be the place to go (just don't order the fruit"
"4.0","Station was very good! The service was great and I really enjoyed my meal. I had the Roasted Carrot Salad with fresh cheese, harissa, pomegranate curd, chickpea fritter, and watercress. I also added chicken for more protein. The salad was extremely unique and delicious. I also had to have the lavender pound cake with a coconut pudding and pineapple. We all enjoyed our meals and were happy. Our server even took a photo of our group, which we appreciated. I wish the prices were a bit more reasonable, but overall, great experience and I would recommend dining at Station!"
"5.0","Delicious and affordable!  We got two lassis, momos (dumplings), potato naan, and two platters of Nepali food for only $30.  We were also the only people in the place on a Friday night! Maybe people can't find the entrance? Subba is on the second story on the corner of E Ohio and Cedar and the door is on Cedar with a red awning.  Enjoy!"
"5.0","They make great vegetarian Thai food - they do tofu right!"
"2.0","***The good thing about the concessions at PNC Park is that they feature local brands/products like Primanti Brothers; the bad thing (and definitely not surprising) is that the ballpark version of Primanti Brothers is probably not a good representation of their food***I have never been to an actual Primanti Brothers location, but I've heard of it.  This Primanti Brothers location is inside PNC Park and it features a limited menu (a few sandwiches and their fries).  The sandwiches are served on thick bread and topped with French fries.I ordered some of their French fries as a side.  They were freshly cut, but the fries had been sitting around for a while.  Some of the fries were crisp, but most of them were limp, soggy and cold (they were also quite greasy).  With the skin on and everything, the fries might capture the great and guilty pleasure experience of carnival fries when they are served just out of the fryer.  But given that the fries are so unevenly cut here, you still may not get consistently great fries with one order (even when they are hot and fresh).Cheese dip is also available for an extra charge.  The cheese dip was the standard cheese dip you get with stadium nachos.The fries were expensive, but I did purchase them at a ballpark and the portion size was generous.Service was fine and quick.Since ballpark food often sits around (I had a similar experience with garlic fries at AT&T Park in San Francisco), PNC Park is probably not the best location to try Primanti Brothers.  The fact that Primanti Brothers is a local product might make you consider giving it a try over other generic concession food at PNC Park.  That being said, PNC Park seems to feature a lot of local food so you may want to explore the park a little before committing to Primanti Brothers (or at the very least, you should request the staff to serve you a fresh batch of food).Primanti Brothers is located within the stadium so it is only for ticket owners.  There are several parking lots and structures nearby.  The lot right next to PNC Park is $25, but a structure just one block over is only $15."
"5.0","Great chai tea! And everything else is great too.. Wish it was closer to where I live, but it is still worth it to go to Oakland."
"5.0","Amazing food, Im not vegan but occasionally Im open to trying good vegan food from time to time. This was by far the best vegan brunch I've had in the city!! I ordered the avocado toast, latke and a side of tofu scramble with blood orange basil soda to drink. It was all very fresh, hot and filling for a very reasonable price. I will definitely be back sometime soon"
"5.0","A delicious dining experience for tapas and drinks with a moody chic vibe. I came with my significant other late on a weeknight after our first dinner option was closed - and were absolutely thrilled with the outcome. The dining room was still pretty full at 9PM on a Friday night, and when the host asked if we had reservations we were a little taken aback. Luckily, we were seated right away and told right away that they served each customer a complimentary glass of champagne to start off the evening (with a valid ID of course). Nothing like clinking some free bubbly to celebrate a good decision! Siempre Algo's menu is more suited to light, tapas-style fare than hefty filling meals, so I'd recommend coming with friends and expecting to pay a little more for the quality of the meal. We started off with some creamy Deviled Eggs - very truffle and very mustard, but less of the promised foie gras, and the recommended rose (Charles and Charles) and Atwater Vanilla Java Porter. Our hostess was the definition of gracious and offered to let us taste the roses before committing. The next two courses, starting with the Crispy Pork Belly, blew us away. It's been a while since I've had glazed pork belly this good, where the first sensation of crunch gives way to a tender, rich bite that has you savoring each forkful. The pea puree beneath wasn't my favorite since it tasted like it was made with goat milk, but bae loved it. We had wanted to order the Soft Shell Crab as our entree, but were forced to choose a plan B because they were out. The Strip Loin Steak turned out to be a more than satisfying choice. The pre-cut slices of steak were another testament to the prowess of the meat master(s) at work in the kitchen: perfect texture, and seasoned just enough to let the flavor of the steak itself shine. I wasn't sure I could find another form of potato to love, but the potato croquette showed me the world is full of pleasant surprises, and the chantarelle mushrooms were exquisite.Had I not been already blown away by the food, I would continue to wax eloquent about Siempre Algo's ambience. Just kidding, I'm gonna do it anyways. It's the perfect gathering spot for young twenty-somethings all the way up to your hip uncle/aunt who doesn't mind mood lighting with their drink of choice. All the waitstaff were helpful and friendly, and it takes some special people to not only refill your water glass, but replace the real wax candle on your table every time you accidentally blow it out when you laugh (which I did 3 times). Siempre Algo is in a more happening part of North Shore where street parking is not the easiest, but head down one of the side streets and you should be able to find something pretty easy within walking distance of the restaurant."
"3.0","For the truly Vietnamese peeps do not order anything besides pho. Probably your safest bet. Spring rolls wasn't all that everyone raving about. Hey but it is Pittsburgh so I can't expect much of the authentic."
"3.0","Overall I enjoy the food here and have been here a couple of times. Unfortunately it seems like pretty regularly they mess up my order, most recently I ordered and paid for a protein to be added and when I got back to the office I found out they didn't have it.  I'll probably be back, but would recommend checking the food closely prior to leaving if you've asked for any customizations or extras."
"4.0","Excellent food, especially given the price.  I can't tell how they stay in business, because I've only ever been in there with one or two other parties.  But the food is really good, and the service is friendly and informal.  Come to get away from the crowds on Walnut, and be surprised by the quality of the food.  All entrees come with salad and rice.  My personal favorite is the cream chicken entree - deelish!"
"4.0","It's simple tasty diner food. I've had the breakfast sandwiches, pancakes, and the Tex breakfast and enjoyed them all and would and have gone back multiple times. Can't speak to the non breakfast food since I haven't had it but everything looks and smells good to me. Sucks that there is usually a line for breakfast."
"3.0","Ambiance: The atmosphere is a little strange, as the restaurant is upstairs above Pamela's, and is coupled with a Peruvian gift shop. It's nothing fancy, but it's kind of entertaining to look at the knick-nacks while you wait for food. Food: I came to La Feria hoping to get some authentic Peruvian food. Although the food was good- i got a pumpkin black bean empanada and some sort of peanut chicken dish- it wasn't anything to write home about. I was hoping for some full-blown authenticity here- I didn't see anything on the menu that screamed 'Peru'; it all seemed very generic Americanized Latin American. I didn't see one unique ingredient in any of the dishes on the menu. With that being said, I would go back, but I would rather roll the dice in trying to find something more authentic, so I doubt I will be back anytime soon."
"5.0","This place is great.  the people here are very friendly, and the new location is roomy, well lit and clean.  The simple fact that it is packed every day is a testament to the quality.  There is always an excellent buffet for lunch with a wide array of both vegetarian and non-veg entrees (typically chicken for the non-veg).  Also their condiment area featuring a number of chutneys, relishes and sauces is extensive.  They typically feature two desserts in the buffet as well.  They will also provide the means, e.g., raw green super hot chili's, to spice up your meal on request.  This is my preferred Indian downtown without question."
"5.0","Excellent excellent. My grandfather was Hungarian and I grew up eating Hungarian foods. This food is excellent and my other friends (non-Hungarians) likes what they had too. The chicken paprikas was what I had and I was excellent. This is a great business and deserves. support. Finally, with so few Hungarian restaurants it is worth a try."
"5.0","This review is solely based on their food as we only do take out from here. BUT nothing compares in my book to the quality and portion size of their meals. For Chinese take out, it's a bit pricer than other places, but well worth it. Every time I order from here I am never disappointed, and I always have leftovers because it's just so much food Their egg rolls are so big and delicious and they also make their own duck sauce that they always include in the order. The only downside is that their location is not super convenient (unless you live downtown), but worth the traffic and drive to get this delicious Chinese food."
"5.0","First time at this restaurant.   It's a small place, not much room. We had the buffet and loved it.  The naan was fresh and chewy!"
"4.0","I would recommend this place for a quick lunch. I ordered the non-vegetarian special of the day, cilantro chicken with rice, french bread, and salad. The chicken was a bit on the dry side, but it still had great flavor. My meal was $11 (pre-tax and tip) which I thought was fair considering that the salad was extremely fresh and there was a decent amount of meat."
"5.0","Got to be one of the best pizza's in Pittsburgh. They make the pizzas right in front of you and for 6$ you get a huge pizza and the toppings are 1.5$ . We usually got two toppings and the bread and cheese are an absolute delight..Highly recommended for lovers of thin crust pizzas.The only inconvenience is they don't have a place to sit anywhere close, so you need to go either to the UPitt canteen place which have a few seats outside or to the park to have a nice view along with the meal..."
"5.0","Toi. Toi is the best. She's the hostess with the everything! She's awesome and helped make our first trip to Pittsburgh a treat. She set up my wife like royalty for her birthday. The food is fantastic, the atmosphere is fun and the prices are great for huge portions. You gotta come here... And ask for Toi!"
"4.0","The fried chicken is alright, but there are other places with better fried chicken. The chicken seems like it is seasoned with ramen packet seasoning, which a lot of people like but I feel as if the chicken isn't as crunchy."
"3.0","Cafe Phipps has a very upscale cafeteria like vibe.  Located adjacent to the gardens of Phipps, the location is really nice in that you can hit this place up before or after you check out Phipps.  We came here for happy hour on a Friday and were pleased with the limited, yet, extremely tasty drink and food options.  In particular, the fried mushroom/cheese balls were tremendous.  Pricing was extremely fair.  It's essentially self-serve, which isn't a bad thing.  Just don't come here expecting a tremendously upscale dining experience.  It's low key and simple, yet clean and efficient.  All in all, unless you're coming here to check out the Conservatory, I wouldn't go out of your way to make it to this spot."
"5.0","Solid food! It was simple but super flavorful. The cashew cheese loaded tots were a bit rich but other than that - no complaints! There was also very good service. I would definitely recommend going here."
"1.0","Whenever I talk about this place, I refer to it as 'Los Causus.'Overpriced not great food, poor service, not that fun of an atmosphere.Don't bother going.  You're better off heading to Emiliano's in the South Side or to any local Mad Mex.  Actually, I think I've had better food at Taco Bell.  I've never been to a Chipotle.I was part of a party of 8 that dined at Las Velas on a Saturday night.  It wasn't that busy, and we did have a reservation, but when we arrived on time, there was a lot of scrambling to get some tables together to accommodate our party.  We got a server who appeared to be in training (as she had someone with her) but neither one of them seemed to understand English. They brought waters for everyone at the table, but only one basket of chips and one serving of salsa.  Again:  Party of 8.I ordered a strawberry margarita with salt on the rim (I prefer salt, not sugar as most places typically do with fruity margaritas), a cup of 'Sopa Cancun,' and a chicken quesadilla without any onions.  I tried really hard not to be a jerk about it, but I made sure I pointed to what I was ordering on the menu as I was ordering so I could be understood.I got a regular margarita with salt, and when I told her I had ordered strawberry, the server who had set it in front of me replied: 'No,' so I said: 'I wanted a strawberry margarita, I ordered a strawberry margarita,' and she took it away and brought back a strawberry margarita.The margarita was okay.  I've read other reviews raving about their margaritas and frankly, I don't get it.  I received a BOWL of soup (I'd ordered a cup) which was below room temperature and basically looked like someone poured water over a half a cup of salsa and threw in 3 pieces of chicken and some rice, and while I was grateful my chicken quesadilla did not have onions as I had requested, it was cold.Everyone in our party seemed excited to be with one another, so everyone ate, but no one seemed particularly impressed with anything they ate or drank.  I also noticed a lot of people passing drinks and plates back across the table to someone else, as the servers kept putting things down in front of the wrong people.At least the bathrooms appeared clean and well-maintained."
"5.0","This is my favorite place to go for a quick drink or food. Also the two bartenders Bubba and Dj are my two favorites .."
"3.0","I waffled a lot between 2 and 3 stars for this place.  I would say it's a solid 2.5.  This place is consistently mediocre with poor service and somewhat high prices.  The food is edible, but not outstanding.  It's also consistently crowded (last time we waited 40 minutes), due to the lovely location on the river with a beautiful view of the 31st st bridge.  It's also pretty fun to watch the boats being taken in and out of the warehouse.  I will continue to go here from time to time when I visit my parents as they live very close by.  I enjoy their pizza.  I have had the ahi tuna sandwich several times... it's ok.  On my most recent visit, my parents and I all got the all you can eat crab legs for 36$ each.  The portions are generous and the meal was a lot of fun fun, but good luck seeing your server to get crab refills!  Their beer list is pretty pathetic."
"5.0","I'm a pretty regular patron of this spot because of this location. I've been here probably around 5 times this year and I get the same thing every time. The fried chicken sandwich is a gem. The chicken is great and the Carolina bbq sauce on it is to die for. I just discovered their sweet herb vinaigrette dressing which is delicious. The restaurant overall is very agreeable and a great place to meet up with friends. Service is always friendly as well. One of my favorite spots downtown."
"5.0","So good!! Who would have thought I would be able to dine Venezuelan street food in a downtown Pittsburgh alley! Fresh made food and fast service! The girl at the counter was very helpful and answered all of our questions."
"5.0","Absolutely great food. When you go to the park hot dog and burgers are great but a good ol promanti bro sandwich is another great Pittsburgh option"
"4.0","Service was slow because only one person was working, other than that, pretty good salads and soups at decent prices"
"1.0","Hello Waiting! Every Hello Bistro I've been to has been terrible. Long wait times, poor service, flies in building. Even when you mobile order, prepare to wait an extra 30 minutes for them to hastily throw your food in a bag & hand it over.I ordered a Superburger Combo meal this afternoon, & specified two specific times to have my burger plain. The burger I got was certainly not plain & looked downright repulsive so I had to throw it away. This was after waiting an extra 30 minutes to pick up my food after mobile ordering. Luckily the food is cheap because I wasted my money.I will never go to Hello Bistro ever again. If you work in Downtown Pittsburgh like I do, I encourage you to go anywhere else for lunch."
"4.0","Yummy burgers and fries served on mismatched China plates. The mini burger comes with a generous serving of fries. The rosemary fries are topped with fresh rosemary. The seating area is kind of loud, so maybe don't bring your elderly grandparents during the dinner rush."
"5.0","I finally tried B52 with a friend after having it on my list forever. I'm happy to say it exceeded my expectations! The atmosphere during the mid-morning on a weekday was really relaxing and nice. The service was impeccable from start to finish as well. I can only imagine how great brunch is!I started with coffee and was given ice water along with it without having to ask, which I appreciated. The coffee was a definitely a cut above what most cafés serve in terms of flavor. My friend and I both got the avocado toast, and I ordered a cinnamon roll after seeing them brought straight from the oven. The cinnamon roll was absolute perfection, and I'm already looking forward to having another. The avocado toast was perfectly executed on fluffy bread with a hint of lemon and sesame seeds on top. It's still rare to find avocado anything in Pittsburgh, so B52 is a breath of fresh air in that regard. With such great food and a host of interesting-sounding coffee drinks and other things to try, I know I'll be back very shortly."
"5.0","FABULOUS beer selection and great sandwiches. To top it off the customer service is superb."
"5.0","Excellent BYOB spot in south side.  There were some older guys kicking it here godfather style with vino flowing...table pounding, jokes and lots of laughter.  I'm not sure if that's the normal here but it created a fun enviroment.  Sad to say that I didn't know it was BYOB or we would have brought vino or beer beverages in.....tonight it was water for my SO and I...(SO meaning significant other).  We ordered the hummus and pita bread which was excellent.  I ordered the chicken house salad which comes with iceburg lettuce, toms, olives, cheese, cucumber, chicken.  HUGE!  The dressing is good stuff...Kevan (SO) ordered the spicy chicken sandwich which looked like a gyro.  I had a bite and could not even identify the spice but wow that kick was good!The total cost $24 without tip.  I did notice there are some more expensive dinner style options here which i will go back and try no doubt (like the filet skewers).This is a great place for some Lebanese style grub.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND and BYOB!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"3.0","Came here before a Pitt football game. We ordered 3 things:  firecracker shrimp, deep fried hoagie, and the buffalo chicken sandwich. The shrimp was by far the best. It comes in a creamy sauce, which is unusual, but flavors were delish. My daughter enjoyed her chicken sandwich. The hoagie was very heavy. It came with tater tots, which were cold and tasted like the ones I buy from the frozen food section of the grocery store. All in all, I'd say the food overall was just OK. On top of that, we waited an hour for our food, which normally is a problem but was OK here just because  we got to the game so early!"
"3.0","I had really high hopes for this place from the first time I walked by.  Unfortunately it was a let down on multiple fronts.First, the atmosphere is not at all welcoming.  It feels like a cafeteria inside.  There is very little decor, the floors and walls are just a bright white, there is a lot of open space, and it just has a weird vibe.  It does not set the scene well for a good eating experience.  The bar area did look cool so maybe I would try to sit there if I ever come back.Onto the food.  Upon looking at the menu I immediately had a bad feeling because the menu says they 'smash' their burgers.  I am not sure why this would be something you advertise.  I'm hoping by they mean prior to cooking they smash down the uncooked meat, rather than during cooking. I ordered the Maggie's Farm burger.  I was expecting a high quality burger given fact that burgers are their main focus, as well as the high prices.  What I got was nothing of the sort.  The burger patty is way too small.  If you are going to be selling five guys style burger patties that is fine, and I can enjoy a good thinner burger.  But to charge $13 or more for a thin smashed burger is absurd.  I ordered mine medium rare and it was over cooked.  I'm not sure if this is even the fault of the cook however because I don't know if it's possible to cook such a skinny patty to medium rare.  The burger also did not come out very hot.The fries were good, as was the homemade ranch dressing.  The overall flavor of the burger was actually good, just not what I was expecting.  It reminded me of Red Robin.  An average piece of beef, but with some very good sauces and toppings.  I just wish they would price their food as such."
"3.0","Four of us split an order of crostini, which was toasted just right and came with a simple but tasty red sauce.  We also had the roasted mushrooms pizza, linguine, and tagliatelle.  All were good, as were the ambiance and service.  Street parking can be challenging, but we were able to park around the block, a short and pleasant walk from the restaurant."
"5.0","Absolutely delicious! Holy cow, lobster bisque fries! Amazing shrimp scampi (and I'm super picky) with meaty shrimps. Loved it all and the staff is super nice."
"5.0","If the place specializes in tea...I'm there! I found myself on the North Side and I just had to stop here.When I first walked in I'll admit that it's not what I expected. It was rather large and very inviting. I was greeted by the cashier and, after learning it was my first visit, she made some recommendations. Since I've been drinking hot tea for a few months now, I decided to go with their iced peach apple cobbler tea. My drink arrived with a few dashes of cinnamon on top. It was very, very good! I was surprised by the strength of the flavors since it can be hit or miss with some teas. This had the flavor of your granny's church cobbler and while it's unsweetened, the cinnamon lent a nice sweet flavor to it. This would be a great place to have a meeting,  map out a project or just chill. Chill was my goal today....mission accomplished. Very nice place with friendly and engaging service. I shall return."
"1.0","I used to frequent jb grille alot for years because i liked the food, so i stopped down last monday afternoon to get something to eat and this is what i saw in the bathroom and there was probably maybe 20 people total in the place, the bar incredibly sticky, as in, not clean. I had 1 drink and left, not coming back unless they start cleaning the place better, very very disappointed"
"5.0","We were recently in Pittsburgh and decided to have dinner at the Capital Grill. We had reservations at 8 and were promptly seated when we arrived at 750. Our server was Margie and she went over everything with us and was a wonderful server. For an app I had the burrata and tomatoes and I was very impressed- perfect!!! For our main course I had the tomahawk veal chop and my wife the rack of lamb. Both cooked perfect rare, and the quality of the cut was top shelf. We had asparagus on the side and it also was perfect. Overall the Capital Grill did not disappoint and I highly recommend."
"4.0","They have gluten-free buns for all sandwiches and burgers for only 50 cents extra. How many other low cost restaurants offer this? I am a fan for this reason alone. My only gripe is that they eliminated the grilled salmon with dill sauce from their menu, which had been one of my favorites."
"5.0","Great ramen! Most recently came here around 8pm on a Tuesday night, and it wasn't too busy. Waitress was lovely, food (as always) was delicious, and free street parking after 6pm was easy to find. We ordered the kimchi fried rice as an starter for our table of 4, and we each got the Signature Meat ramen. I swapped out the meatballs for extra noodles and the chili paste for the inferno oil. Strongly recommend! While it took a while for our food to come out despite it not being busy, every other time I've come has been pleasant so not much to complain!"
"5.0","Just loved it! One of the best Mexican food I have ever experienced!!Usually very busy, just thought could have a little faster service time Best if there is an appointment already"
"5.0","Absolute fantastic dinner!! My partner and I came here on a Thursday evening (no trouble getting a reservation online). Even though I don't eat meat (I came here once before when I did used to eat meat and it was divine as well), there were a ton of options on the menu -it did help that I do eat fish though. My partner and I started off with a tuna dish -poke-like tuna, with peaches, a saffron chili oil, microgreens and wonderful fried shiitake mushrooms. We then ordered the ox-tail (for him), the most recent octopus dish, and championones a la plancha (mushrooms). WOW. The octopus and mushroom dishes were definitely our favorites. The octopus is cooked perfectly and served alongside chickpeas that are pickled and then rolled in (a spice that I cannot remember). Mushrooms were mixed together with an egg yolk -the flavor was definitely a little heavy but insanely delicious, especially when you topped the bread with it. All the dishes (save for the platters) are tapas-sized. We ordered 4 dishes, which was the perfect amount for us to enjoy dinner and still get dessert.For dessert, we ordered the churros and frozen crema catalana. The chocolate/hazelnut sauce that came with the churros was the perfect amount of bitterness (great chocolate). The crema catalana we had was a simple vanilla and maple flavor. Again, delicious, a bit lighter than a creme brulee. Overall, the meal was fantastic. As for the actual setting, the tables are a bit close together and lighting is a bit dim, so it's definitely better for a more intimate dinner. The service was fantastic -Sara(h) recommended us fantastic wines to go along with our dishes."
"4.0","The third floor is the place to be. As long as it's not raining or the movable roof is broken. Then it gets a little hot up there on the rooftop. Both of those things happened to me during recent visits but I will say that it didn't stop me giving this place a four star review for their happy hour.Their appetizers are half off and they have $5 drinks. This is an awesome deal for downtown happy hour and the atmosphere on the third floor is actually beautiful. We recently had a work happy hour here and it was awesome. Other than the roof not working. But we may do and got tables closer to the opening.They do not have reservations for the third floor so it's just come one come all. But there is a lot of seating so it shouldn't be an issue to find a c or to find a place to set your drink if you do have to stand around a table. And the tables are pretty long so just pull up next to someone and make a new friend.My favorite drink is a frozen rose there. It is refreshing especially on a hot summer day. And it is part of the $5 happy hour special so really you can't go wrong. My favorite snack is the carrot hummus with arugula pesto. I know it sounds super weird but honestly it is delicious and I keep on suggesting it to everyone including the people who are sharing our table not part of our group. The pretzels with the governmental cheese are definitely the second favorite on the list. The cajun fries are always going to be a favorite because fries are delicious and a little bit of spice is awesome. I didn't think like the brie as much as I wanted to or the artichoke crab dip. But I will say that on the Brie I did like the the fruit.If you are downtown and want something interesting and different go and have a few drinks and appetizers on a rooftop bar. It is fun and a good way to pass some time after a long day of work."
"5.0","After trying most Mexican restaurants & food trucks in town, Edgar's tacos are the most amazing tacos in Pittsburgh and are very authentic. I crave them on a regular basis.I've had the chorizo tacos multiple times. What I like about his chorizo tacos are they are delicious and flavorful, but not super greasy which is the case with most chorizo tacos. The shrimp in the tacos are small and fried, but equally delicious.I like how he has multiple salsas you can put on them.Even though I'm obsessed with his tacos the hibiscus tea was to die for. I could drink that every day. Soooooo good!The other great thing about Edgar is he is extremely friendly and his staff are as well. They are also very efficient.Like most taco stands in town, you either have to stand or take them with you. There is one small table inside, but that's it."
"4.0","Hubs and I decided to come here on a Friday night for dinner. We were able to get a seat with ease, keeping in mind it was the weekend before the holidays and we were doing a later dinner.We were seated in the back dining room. It's a flashback to the past in a comforting way, with Fiesta plates. We ask for the drink menu and see a variety of wine and beer options. The wines don't list the vineyards, so it was difficult to discern. The beers included a good number of local crafts.The specials include entrees and salad or dessert. It was a bit more food than we wanted, so we opted for the traditional menu. The seafood Devonshire caught my eye as did the veal diablo. Hubs was curious about the make your own pasta but at the mentioned of the veal diablo and options paralysis, he knew what he wanted.We ordered and the waitress was helpful with the wine selection, noting the Chanti hubs ordered was on the sweet side, so he was able to swap it out for the dryer option. The food comes out within a reasonable time and it piping hot. The waitress realize she forgot our bread and brings it out, very much needed with the amount of sauce in out entrees. The veal diablo is delicious. I took a bite and was wowed by the spicy flavor. The seafood Devonshire is creamy and rich. The tart/pie crust was fluffy. The crab meat is imitation, so keep that in mind.Overall solid meal, good service, and large portions. It was a bit pricey for a neighborhood spot."
"4.0","Been here several times. I am not a drinker, here for food. Decent size serving. The slice of carrot cake was humongous! It was very good non the less."
"3.0","We did not come for the food only drinks on a Saturday Afternoon.     We were warned this placed is flooded by college kids at night - which seemed interestnig and we were thinking about coming back for the comedic affect.    We did get our comedy for the day at this place.   When the bartender ran a purse out of the establishment to give to another person (who she thought left it).   The funny thing was that it was not that person's purse.Any way the beers were cold and tasty.  We did not eat there but others were.    they have a spin wheel which determines the shot you will need to drink.I would go back but be warned - this place will get much younger as the night progresses.Atmosphere - Traditional Pub during the day - good craft beer selection - easy going / funCost - normal - about $5 per craft beerService - Great - Our server was great.Enjoy"

"4.0","The food is excellent. Five stars for flavor and quality. My husband and I went here for our anniversary and asked to be seated in a quiet corner. We were escorted to a table for two upstairs - and seated right next to the only other couple in the room. (what?!?) Tables are close so.. Not ideal. The tables are also wooden (with cracks) with no table cloth or even paper over them which begs the question of hygiene. Especially since the table was not cleared of any food spills between courses. And the water glasses leave a big wet spot with nothing to absorb ( a paper cocktail napkin would help). We each ordered a drink. Hint :  if the pour is going to be that small at least put it in an appropriate sized glass so it's not so obvious. And no I won't order a second glass for the price. (even the waiter looked apologetic when I commented on it). The roasted tomato soup was delicious but please serve it on a larger plate so that the bread crust can be removed and cut easily. (I had to ask for an additional plate). Also those serving the food brought the right dishes but gave them to the wrong person. The chairs are very good for your posture (straight backed) but not very comfortable when paired with a seat cushion of minimal padding. And forget about crossing your legs - table is not conducive to that. I know you're wondering why I gave four stars with all my complaints :  because the waiter was knowledgeable and the food was that good. So... Consider take out rather than eating in. You'll love the food without the hassle."
"5.0","Great service and the all you can eat crab legs are a steal. They have very fast service and the way they make their crab legs are better than any other!"
"4.0","I visited Streets on Carson last Fri. at 6pm for HH with fellow Yelper Amanda J.  I arrived first and grabbed a seat at the bar, and I was immediately greeted by the friendly bartender, Alec, with a handshake.  He provided me with a HH drink and food menu and told me to let him know if I had any questions.Always a sucker for cocktails, my eyes immediately gravitated to the infused spirits on the HH menu ($5 each).  Per the recommendation of the woman sitting next to me, I decided to try the tarragon rum.  It wasn't overly sweet, and the flavor of tarragon was quite distinct but not overwhelming.  Though it packed a punch, it went down *real smooth.*  Next, I ordered the lemon gin.  I wasn't as much of a fan of this one.  To my surprise, it had a deep pink color, and the lemon flavor wasn't as distinct as I expected--even with my eyes closed, I'm not sure that I could have readily identified it as lemon.For food, we ordered from the HH small plates menu, which contains miniature versions of several of their regular menu items ($4-$5 each).  We ordered the arancini balls and the poutine to share.  Though this was my first time trying arancini, I can call myself a fan.  They had a creamy interior and a crisp exterior, and the sauce accompanying them complemented them nicely.  The poutine impressed me less, though it wasn't bad.  Like many poutines, I found it on the salty side, but the flavor and consistency of the gravy was nice.  The cheese curds weren't as plentiful or large as those of some other poutines I've tried around town, but the heat of the gravy caused them to partially melt, creating the stringiness characteristic of a good poutine.As other reviewers have mentioned, the decor of Streets is quite artistic and interesting, evoking a playful urban vibe.  In particular, I was a fan of the traffic lights in the front windows, and I thought the idea of naming the tables after PGH streets was creative and interesting.  I also really like the thematic concept of Streets, which is to serve street food from around the world.  Their HH was a great value, and I enjoyed the food and drinks, so I'd definitely return."
"5.0","Went here for brunch shortly after they opened.  Hostess said our wait would be half and hour, ended up being more like 15 minutes.  The atmosphere is minimalist and rustic, while still maintaining a sense of warmth that's very inviting.  I was with my husband, who isn't crazy about 'weird, hippie food,' and thus appropriately skeptical about this place, which holds itself out as a vegan/veg friendly establishment.Well, he was pleasantly surprised!  From the coffee special (something amazing with homemade almond milk and orange essence) to the flat bread to the tofu scramble, everything we had was tasty, balanced, and well executed.  The service was attentive and helpful, and our waiter eagerly explained the things on the menu that we weren't familiar with.All in all, this is a really unique new spot that is serving up some beautiful, delicious food in a lovely atmosphere.  What's not to like?"
"4.0","Sunday breakfast stop today. Had the omelet with spinach ,red peppers and cheddar cheese, very good sized and very tasty. The potatoes were really good, cooked perfectly and not dried out at all. Toast was extra but it was just simple toast. Challah french toast wad the winner here with 4 large halves of toast with fruit and whipped cream. It was made perfectly,  not mushy at all and neither was it too crispy, it was just right! Good coffee and lots of bottled drinks to pick from as well. I can't wait to try it out for lunch sometime soon."
"4.0","Food: 1) vegetable samosa 2) chicken tikka masala 3) special chicken biryani 4) bread bowl. The food was more than enough to feed three people.The basmati rice was beautifully cooked to a nice fluffiness. The chicken tikka masala was very tender and lean. The chicken biryani had a bit of a kick to it, as the chicken was spicy. Naan was phenomenal. Overall, delicious.Service was extremely hospitable. Restaurant was first floor of a house, which was quaint."
"4.0","It's Taco Tuesday!! Most expensive taco on menu is $1.25. You can choose from beef, pulled pork, rice and beans and an adventure taco (chef's choice weekly). 5pm-10pm for tacos and 5pm-7pm for happy hour. Happy Hour deals are probably some of the best in town. Also love coming here to see live bands and partake in Obscure Game Night, there's open mic nights and so much more. A fave spot for sure."
"4.0","Everything we ordered at Girasole was delicious but the restaurant was very cramped and not very accommodating. However; the gnocci was worth the wait and shoving."
"4.0","I first heard of this place through their mailer ad.  Their menu is very large (pasta to gyros to salads, not to mention their actual pizzas) which I think hurts them a bit.  I read a review on a different site that gave them a low rating based on their soups, but I don't think this should be representative of their pizza.  Come on people!  If you're going to order out to a pizza place, get the freakin' pizza!  Which brings me to my next point: their pizza is absolutely delicious!  The best part is their fantastic crust, which is just the right amount of chewiness and crispiness and taste.  Some people prefer a really thick or thin crust, so I should mention that theirs is a little bit on the thick side, but it's always cooked perfectly (no dough-iness).  I've tried their specialty Seafood Pizza as well as their Artichoke Pizza and both were loaded with toppings and tasted sooooo good.  I also have tasted their plain cheese pizza, which was tasty also.  Their prices are incredibly reasonable (especially for the specialty pizzas) and keep in mind that their 'medium' pizza is like a large at Pizza Hut or Papa Johns.  I have had the pizza delivered as well as chosen to pick it up.  They might be a little slow when delivering because they offer to deliver to such a huge area, so the smart thing to do might be to call in for pick up.  So in closing, skip all the 'fluff' on their menu and try one of their specialty pizzas.    You won't be disappointed!"
"4.0","This is a neighborhood pizza shop. Family owned for a longtime. They have good pizza and wege. Friendly stuff. It is my always go to for a fast pizza."
"1.0","Went to Banksville Eat & Park on Saturday with my family.Our waitress was Bernadette . We had two bills. First she screwed up which bill went to which family. Of course this was after she already charge my account then she took both the bills again and credit my account. You would think this would be over but heck no not with Bernadette she again took my card and charged both bills on my account never ever using my brothers card. How does one do this??? All I can say I will never go back and if anyone else goes pay in cash- u will be charged 100 times if u get Bernadette -Laura I already filled out the feedback form on line and nobody got back to me -I'm happy to say that the General Manager Bob called me and my money will be refunded to me. Very Happy"
"4.0","Not sure why this place only has three stars, all my visits there have been great. This is definitely an overlooked spot in Market Square. I've had the chicken tacos which were delicious. The portions are huge and great to take home for leftovers. Also, make sure to order the trio; it gives you all the chips you can eat with salsa, guacamole, and queso for $10; not too shabby. The ambience is good. Once when I was there a mariachi band played, quite a treat."
"2.0","I came here the Steeler game on Monday night with two of my friends. The space is nice and roomy with a lot of seating. My friends and i found a table at the bar area and sat there. I will start by saying two things: 1) our waiter came right over and asked for our drink orders (i like that) and 2) the bar area was a little busy, not definitely not completely full. He brought us back our drinks and then went on to another table. He wanted to put an app in, but our waiter never came back. Finally when he did, he brought another guy over and said that since they were so busy (they weren't) that they would both be helping us out tonight. A while later, the original waiter comes back over and says 'he's taking care of you now, right? Okay good.' Then ran away as fast as he came. At this time we were still waiting to put our appetizer order in. Finally about a half hour later, the second guy comes over and asks if we needed anything. (My water was empty). At that time, we put in our appetizer order, some more drink orders, and i asked for more water, because we didn't know when he'd be back. He came back about 10 minutes later with our appetizer and then about 10 minutes after that when our drink orders. A while later he came back to take our dinner orders. Two of us got salads and the third person for a turkey burger. It took almost 45 minutes for our food to arrive and was brought out by someone else. A half hour after our food came out, our waiter came back and was very anxious to give us our check. He did not check to see how our food was nor did he refill our drinks. Once he dropped off the checks, he was very quick to take our checks and bring them back. We stayed until the end of the game and he didn't come back to check on us once we cashed out. He didn't offer any more water or anything. On top of that, the food was nothing exciting. I gave this place 2 stars because the atmosphere and warm and inviting and it is a great place to watch a game. But, i probably won't be back."
"4.0","Very very very good!  I have a tendency to judge an Italian restaurant by their meatballs. Not the sauce, no restaurant made sauce will ever compare to Grandma's.  But the meatballs here are awesome!! 2 thumbs up!  For an entree I got a tortellini dish and my husband got ummm.....AHHHHH I don't know but it was very tasty. Something with angel hair pasta. Then we ordered dessert which at the end of the meal our waitress told us was on her because we came out in such bad weather (it's pretty ugly outside tonight). In our leftover bag our waitress put in there an entire loaf of bread for free...talk about wonderful customer service!"
"5.0","I wanted to try this place for it's interesting menu and the live string quartet and my friend, less interested in these finer aspects of an experience, just wanted beer and some screens to watch the basketball game and I was like YUSSSSSS.. HUSZAR FTW!! They scored on all counts - Great Croatian beer and two big TVs screening the basketball game so my friend was happy. AND for me, the absolutely enjoyable live band playing traditional and folk Hungarian tunes, the Hungarian wine that my waitress recommended as well as the crowd which despite mostly being regulars was so welcoming and friendly. Soon after we walked in and were taking in the sights and sounds, a Hungarian-Croatian couple struck up a conversation with us, welcoming us and asked us if we were going to eat. We must have looked doubtful because they quickly told us that the food is amazing and we shouldn't miss dessert! I'm glad I took her advice!! :) It's telling when customers welcome you, and tell you to come back again, that they are proud of their little neighborhood joint and it's story as if it were their own. The service was great - We missed last call for ordering dessert but our waitress very kindly accommodated us and we were able to eat one of their yummy Hungarian style crepes with apricot jam and rum. The food had plenty of vegetarian options for me. I shared the friend cheese appetizer with my friend and had the mushroom paprikas for my entrée - A1! Like I said, not one aspect of my experience here was sub-optimal. I will be going back for sure and highly recommend this place, especially on a Thursday when the Gypsy Strings are playing. We went at around 9pm, so we found seating easily but I was told that an hour ago, the place was PACKED and we would have had to stand. You could make reservations though! And I'll pass on what I was told when I walked in - You don't wanna miss dessert! :)"
"2.0","A 30 minute wait turned into an hour. Then another hour to get our simple breakfast plates. Food was fine but 2.5 hours was redic. A simple apology would have gone a long way to make us feel better."
"4.0","A nice middle eastern style restaurant with a good selection of food. I really like the baba ganoush. Very creamy and smoky. Their pita  read seems.to be fresh and home made, and very thin and chewy.I.had the lamb kabob sandwich,  the meat was well cooked and tender. I.liked the yogurt sauce too.The falafel my nephew ordered was a bit different from how I have ever seen it, much lighter brown, drier, and more crumbly. It was ok, but I personally prefer it how I have usually seen it. Maybe it is a regional style I have not seen before.Overall a good place, with good food."
"2.0","I really want to like this place, but every time I've eaten here it's been a negative experience and I'm tired of giving Earth Inspired the benefit of the doubt. From giant kale leaves and stems that are impossible to chew, to a 'grain bowl' with completely uncooked, hard-as-a-rock rice, the food quality is totally inconsistent. I've always gotten takeout and discovered these quality issues when I'm back at my office, unfortunately. A general problem with this place is that after the salads are assembled, they are not chopped up or mixed very well, so the dressings aren't blended and there are often really large pieces of veggies. The employees here are also not very friendly.Earth Inspired is one of the only lunch places downtown that has a such wide salad selection and some of their toppings and dressings are quite good, especially the seasoned tofu and cheeses. The also include a slice of delicious, seedy bread. The price can add up very quickly if you add more than the basic toppings, but the price is fair for a large salad portion."
"5.0","Great food and service. Don't let the entrance fool you. It's a gem! The lamb was so tender and full of flavor."
"4.0","Exactly what I was looking for!  We got a medium and it was more than enough for 4 + leftovers.  Really good crust, sauce, toppings (cappicola).   There area ton of pizza places around here, but I'm not sure I will bother trying any others!"
"5.0","Thai Gourmet has been my go-to Thai restaurant for years. In my opinion, it's the best Thai food in Pittsburgh. Everything is super spicy (which I love), authentic, fresh, and scrumptious. The servers at Thai Gourmet are really nice and  the food comes out quickly. The inside of the restaurant has lots of traditional Thai decor and succulents. It is a little small inside, but they have worked around that by remodeling the interior. We started off our dinner with the summer rolls. You get your choice of tofu, chicken, or shrimp. My sister is vegetarian so we opted for tofu. They have lots of vegetarian/vegan options here. The summer rolls were amazing! The vegetables inside were crisp and the peanut dipping sauce paired nicely with the rolls. For my main course, I opted for the Pad Kee Mao with shrimp. You get to pick your level of spice, so I opted for a 10. The spiciness does not disappoint here! The Pad Kee Mao was phenomenal. The noodles, the veggies, the shrimp, the spice, the portion- everything was perfect. My sister loved her Shrimp Pad Thai and said it was the best one she's ever had. If you want to try Pittsburgh's greatest Thai food, definitely come to Thai Gourmet. I have a great experience every time I come here."

"2.0","Cool setting but for me that was about it. The menu was a huge let down. Not much fresh seafood. Battered and fried. Very dark outside as well. We didn't care for the atmosphere and didn't actually eat anything. Just a glass of wine."
"1.0","The service was terrible. Our waitress was distant seemed like her cat died or she killed someone. Than we ordered our food and instead of potato pancakes she brought hash browns, which were over salted and terrible. Then we got pie and we were on our second bite, and a very long hair was baked into the filling, barf. She suggested another piece of apple. Overall terrible experience, will never go back. Wish I could give zero stars."
"5.0","Been here a few times.  It's awesome when you can find a seat and it's awkward when you can't.   Really great in the summer when they open the garage doors up.  They make awesome drinks and the bar tenders are really great and friendly.   They recently started serving food and from what I have heard it is pretty good but it is a limited menu.  Check out my IG @lookwhatIcaneatrightnow"
"5.0","A tantalizing taste of Mexico with a quaint second floor view overlooking Market Square. Friendly, attentive staff, full bar with creative drink menu, charming decor, and delicious dinner choices served at generous sizes. My wife and I tried two brands of tacos (with a little mixing and matching), while the kids, 8 and 5, split a fajita, which they couldn't stop raving about the whole walk home."

"4.0","I recently visited Mezzo for the first time and had an excellent experience. I made a reservation online about a week prior to the Wednesday dinner. I browsed the menu online in anticipation of the meal. The friendly hostess seated our party of five at a comfortable six-top right by the window overlooking lively Penn Ave. Our courteous server guided us through the menu that offers a pleasing variety of food and drinks - including more options than are listed online. The highlights of my meal include the charcuterie board, the cheese board, and the lamb entree. The wine pairing was spot on.  The portions were elegant and satisfying. Everyone in my party enjoyed their meal. Our server was attentive and relaxed - keeping pace with our leisurely group. I highly recommend Mezzo for the delicious food, service, decor, and location. It's my new downtown go-to Italian restaurant."

"3.0","We were in town and wanting to watch his Jets and my Steelers, so we thought Bettis' would give us a good mix of 'being with the crowd' actually attending a game, and 'being able to watch on TV.' We were correct in that regard, though the TVs were a little on the small side. I'm spoiled though, so I didn't actually complain about that or anything. Just something I noted. Being as it was game day we got there early, and despite being told there was a 2 hour wait, were seated within 10 minutes (our first drink at the bar hadn't even been poured yet.) I'm sure it's hard to guess whether a group is staying for the whole game or just trying to eat before heading to the game, so that was sort of understandable.I started with a mimosa, and then found out they were $8....and since they were served in a plastic 5oz water cup....not exactly worth it. We opted for the Miller Light $4 special instead. We shared a pile of wings, and the spinach/artichoke dip. The dip was one of the better ones I've had, and even though I'm not typically a pork belly person, it definitely added a little something something. The wings were good too, definitely meaty! We tried black and gold BBQ and Hot Buffalo. Whoo! That was hot. For serious.Overall, it's good people watching and sports watching, especially on game day, but there are a few things that could be improved upon (like the mimosa situation.) They had fun raffles and whatnot throughout the game too which was fun."
"5.0","This was a nice family Italian restaurant.  Food was very good, and service was excellent.  Our server was a young lady named Mieke, and she really added a lot of pleasure to the dining experience. We would certainly go back to dine here again."
"5.0","My go-to Chinese food in Pittsburgh. I've never been disappointed in my many meals. I often call in and get to-go food, and the nice ladies that work the phones/front counter/cash register are always friendly, greet you with a smile, straight to business, and usually don't have to ask, they remember me & load me up with plastic silverware plates, & napkins. Their restaurant is always clean, has a small bar area with booth seating, and the other section has more of a fine dining atmosphere. They serve you hot delicious tea and ice water upon sitting down.If ordering delivery, they only deliver downtown during lunch hours because they deliver via bicycle. I compared the price when ordering delivery via yelp & foodler & foodler was cheaper (& also - that's a middle man to Meals Delivered - but I like my foodler points/convert to $).The usually offer a coupon on their website."
"5.0","I absolutely love Café Phipps, and eating here is always a treat. Combined with an actual trip into Phipps, and a meal here can easily be part of a perfect afternoon or evening.The cafe itself is a lovely, bright, colorful part of Phipps' main lobby and floor. In my experience it's always been well maintained, i.e kept very clean with plants and candles put out on the tables. The framed photos of fields and fresh produce hanging on the walls just complete the cafe's fresh and vibrant look and feel.While the menu itself (and the ingredients of what's sold here) often changes with the season and availability of produce, the general idea of the menu is always the same - you can order or mix-and-match soups, salads, sandwiches, a couple entree-items at times, and a quiche of the day. There are also usually smaller bites and side dishes like fruit cups, as well as dessert options like cupcakes. And as far as I know, all of the items are made from fresh, organic, and local ingredients, or brought in from local vendors.And I have to say, nothing here has let me down. The soups in particular always impress me - you can tell that their tomato soup is freshly made and it's always very think and pulpy; I feel healthier and happier just looking at it! Their salads are always a lovely blend of veggies and dressing (and meat if you opt for it, although Phipps is very vegetarian friendly), and the sandwiches have been perfectly toasted and to die for in my experience. Honestly it's impossible for me to leave without a smile on my face after eating here, the ingredients used are just so wonderful and perfect together.Oh, and since Phipps is one of the green leaders in town, it should come as no surprise that they aim to recycle and compost the few dishes and silverware items that can't be washed and reused.I seriously have no complaints about this little eatery. The best part about the cafe is that a visit to Phipps, while recommended, is not required. So if you want a healthy and/or tasty meal, this is definitely the place to go!"

"4.0","Not sure why this place gets so many bad reviews.The authentic Sichuan menu is pretty decent. You won't get mind-blowing Spicy Boiled Fish for example, but it's definitely tasty. They have a pretty complete menu, and you'll have an opportunity good amount of variety every time you go.Admittedly though, their food lies more on the wet side, which means they don't make crispy things as crispy as they should, and when they fry some of their veggies, it comes out to tasting steamed rather than stir-fried. For example, the string beans I ordered, some beans were crunchy but most were soggy.The food is tasty, and to reiterate that point, some dishes I've ordered, such as the cumin lamb and beef noodle soup all have good all around flavor and an okay amount of spicy. The foods I would watch out for are the non-Sichuan dishes, namely the Cantonese style dishes that come out to be really bland and miss the mark.Boba was also decent, so I'll give that a plus too. Overall, decent restaurant for semi-authentic Sichuan cuisine."
"4.0","Authentic tacos at an excellent price point. They have an appealing menu and great service. The chicken included avocado, farmer's cheese, cilantro and lime. Delicious.The taco shells are soft, with a choice of flour or corn.  I highly recommend the corn."
"5.0","I never had Korean fried chicken before. Don't get me wrong, I've always been a huge fan of Korean food. But it was not until recently did I hear the phrase Korean Friend Chicken. Tried it with a friend who has been here before and loves the food. Ordering was easy, they don't have much but fried chicken, bubble tea of different flavors and some appetizers. We got takoyaki and a large portion of sweet and spicy fried chicken.Takoyaki was good. If you haven't had it please google gif. files of how the thin fish flakes wave as heat convection occurs at surface of the 'octopus-meatball'. Looks nice and tastes even better. But the chicken was so special that it completely dominated over the appetizer. Perfect crispiness, good sauce and satisfying portion. We ordered a large portion - 15 wings and 9 drumsticks. The drumsticks were HUGE. But we almost finished it. Just give you a brief idea how good the chicken was. Not a large restaurant, takes a while to get the fried chicken, and things can get messy when eating the chicken wings. They have the smart application of this three-finger-plastic 'glove' you can put on, and it is effective in terms of not getting sauce all over your hand. Also rumors say that they have the best bubble tea in town.Hope you will enjoy it as I did!"
"5.0","Great juice ! Coffee is really good and really cool environment! The best place in Pittsburgh for sure !"
"1.0","Close location for cmu and pitt students. The sushi is just okay. I ordered chicken which was good.But the duck soup? I found 3 or 4 chicken wings in it? I am sure it was chicken because there is also a duck wing in the soup and i could clearly make a difference. I double checked in case it was my mistake but I was disappointed... I dont know whether it was kind of deceiving consumers, but i will not come again"
"5.0","Staff and atmosphere a little goofy and weird lol   The food tho!! I had the red lentil soup which was the best I've had in the city of Pittsburgh so def get that The falafel sandwich on gluten free bread!! The bread is so soft and was like cake on the sandwich!! Beyond amazing. Request the gluten free bread with your sandwiches I'm telling you Plus I had the avocado toast on the gluten free bread and it was so soft and heavenly to eat. Literally melted in your mouth fast!!  Oh yah The buffalo cauliflower is ridiculous too!! All of these foods I'm listing I co sign and you can take that to the bank. Bye Felicia If your vegan I highly recommend you come check this place out."

"5.0","We've been following Justin and Curtis since they did pop ups around town and have been excited ever since they opened.   Honestly, one my favorite restaurants of the past few years (inclusive of moving from Los Angeles and trips around the country).   Always inventive and unique, seasonal dishes that are done perfectly.  Bar is fantastic as well.  Love just sitting there and having the bartender craft a cocktail based on taste.My only knock (minor as it is) is the limited dessert menu.   But honestly the rest of the menu is so good I tend not to have room!"

"1.0","Very bad experience. Fails completely in regards to food as well as service. This was perhaps the worst service experience I have ever had. The owner was too rude and unprofessional. She needs to get management and hospitality courses and then run a restaurant. Terrible value for money and too small portion sizes.It all started with warm beer. When asked the server told that their cooler was not working. If this was the case then they should have told that the same before. Then we ordered the appetizer 'Delhi ki papri chaat' which according to the menu should have papri, potatoes, chickpeas and chutneys. But we were served with just papri and chutney (no potatoes, no chickpeas, plain papri and chutney). On asking the server told that he will call the owner to talk to. The owner never showed up until we were done eating the main course. On asking the server again to call the owner to talk to but she didn't even have the courtesy to show up. On our getting upset on receiving the check, the server was able to call the owner lady who instead of accepting the mistake or apologizing and replacing the dish, kept saying that they alter the menu for their american customers and were too busy to change the menu. On top of that, to my surprise, she blamed is for calling her thrice to enquire about the appetizer we were served as she was too busy that evening and kept on giving lame excuses. We ended up getting no replacement for the appetizer and ruining our dinner!!!Would never even think of going there and would not recommend ever."
"1.0","I am s regular customer for breakfast , today I ordered my usual breakfast sandwich and a large half and half sweet tea with a little bit of ice. What I got was a cup of ice a little bit of tea even though I repeated it several times ,the employee told me there was just a little bit of ice. This was of course bullshit. And these people. Want $15 an hour??? Bring on the kiosks."
"5.0","Food was excellent! I love this place because it has amazing quality food but the atmosphere is so fun yet relaxed. It's definitely not some stuffy seafood restaurant. I had the crab stuffed salmon and my husband had the shrimp and scallops. Both were amazing and very filling! We also had small salads to start and I have to say that the lemon ginger dressing g was the best dressing I have ever eaten. They seriously need to bottle that up and sell it because I would buy a case!!! The only thing that I would say that was not perfect was the fact that I didn't know they served sushi. I'm not sure if you have to ask for that menu because we didn't get to look at it. I only knew because the table beside us got some. I would have definitely ordered that as an appetizer if I had known. Looking forward to going back and trying the lobster bisque fries... Who ever thought of that must be a genius because they sound amazing!!!"
"4.0","We ate at Ki Ramen on a recent trip to Pittsburgh. It is a cute place, we sat in the main dinning area when you first enter. We got the meat Bao and Curry ramen. The Bao bread was really good and had interesting flavors. The ramen was a huge portion - we shared it. It was creamy, spicy and delicious. We also ordered sake and wine which were both tasty. The staff was friendly and kind, prices were pretty good. It was a cozy place with low lights, nice for dates of groups. The high top seating along the window looked really cold. The music was good but had us laughing -- an interesting mix of 90s hip hop, a few other old school songs, and current music.I took a star off for a few things that were not a huge deal but we would have wanted to go a little smoother. There were several tables open throughout the main dinning area and they sat us directly next to one couple and directly behind another. Our waiter was a bit slow when we wanted to order a glass of wine and again when we wanted our check even though it did not seem super busy."
"3.0","Great food but dessert is definitely not their forte. Tables are too close to each other so it is hard to squeeze and it is not private. This used to be a great place a few years ago when it opened, price has considerably gone up with the hype. A few dishes are great but, as Spaniard, they mess up others--iberic ham for example was too thick, which is a waste of the product. Frozen crema catalana for dessert is not good (it shouldnt be frozen!). Probably the best Spanish restauranr in town but still lots to learn and improve"
"5.0","Me and my boyfriend came here last minute and nothing but great things to say about the food and the service . Our waiter Kurt was very informative and friendly ! We will def be back !"
"5.0","3rd time here and absolutely love it. George is the best waiter very accommodating very nice and we come from Delaware and always ask for George! Food is amazing too!"
"2.0","Boneless chicken was lukewarm and we got regular pizza after ordering thin crust... oof"
"1.0","Cold below average pizza. I ordered the 12 cut, the girl taking the order said 'it's square' okee dokee probably tastes the same. No only was it not square, it wasn't warm, didn't taste good it was cold and way overpriced for the quality of food we got."
"5.0","I'm sitting in the car immediately after leaving Federal Galley and I have to post right away because it was just THAT good. I had the roast beef enchiladas with hatch green chile sauce and have never been more full from stuffing my face with deliciousness."
"4.0","Nice little place that produces Korean style chicken with bubble tea.  The chicken was very tasty.  Got the large bucket with 20 pieces.  I asked for 20 wings but they gave me 13 wings and 7 drumsticks.  Not sure why.  Maybe it was end of day and they didn't have enough wings.  But if you get a mixture of wings and drumsticks, you only get 15 pieces so I guess I made out.  The bubble tea was good but it's from powder.  I had the taro, wish there was some real taro pieces. And you can adjust the sweetness too.  Overall, not bad for Pitt area."
"3.0","For those who remember, the previous occupant of this space was Eclipse.  Cinderlands has transformed the space in a very appealing manner.  The bar area is nicely done and the back room has an impressive mural.  To start, we tried a couple of the beers.  They were good but nothing really stood out.  On to appetizers....The perogies were exceptional.  The mustard  creme fraiche really made the dish.  The brussels sprouts were also an interesting dish.  The addition of the pomegranate really changed the flavor in a good way.The red lentil falafel was rather disappointing.  Just bland.  No flavor here.  I could not finish it.  The fries on the other hand were way too salty. My friends had the burger and seemed to like it."
"2.0","For the money, go somewhere else! I ordered the mussels with white wine and it was ok, they need to learn how to cook shellfish! For my entree I order Caesar salad with Shrimp and Shrimp was cold and like leather!I was disappointed...."
"1.0","We are a huge fan of Coca Cafe. The food is great: however, the last 3 times we've been here the no wait app shows 'no wait' and there is a line at the door.  The wait time for your order is 30-45 minutes and I've been looking at 2 empty tables for 20 minutes that haven't been cleared. There is too much brunch competition in Pittsburgh for any restaurant to be so lax. This is likely our last time here."
"5.0","Great coffee and teas, delicious sandwiches. The owner is a super nice guy, love having this little gem so close to home!"
"5.0","This place was BYOB and we had to wait about 30 minutes. The venue was small and they played 'iron maiden' genre music. I am not vegan but I enjoyed the tacos very much. Overall the prices were a lot more reasonable than I had expected. I would definitely come back here with vegan friends since as of now this seems like the only vegan sit down restaurant that I am aware of in Pittsburgh."
"4.0","Fast service. Good food. I had the 'famous special' (just its name) with Corned beef & sauerkraut on rye. Nice blend of thousand island & mayo. Two pickle spears & large drink for under $10. One free refill...Oh yeah, there is an ok bar too"
"5.0","I came here three times in four days, exceptional Vegetarian Ramen in a hearty miso broth with soy ginger tofu done right and delicate beech mushrooms. Being by myself in the big city, this was an easy place to show up alone and sit at the bar, unhurried and relaxed.For the vegetarian, there is also a beautiful Heart and Soul salad and salt and pepper tofu appetizer that makes a full meal."
"3.0","We stopped on here about 3 hours before a Steelers game so because the portions are meant for family style, we just ordered an appetizer trioWe got calamari, spicy shrimp and artichoke dip , all 3 were above average , service was very good and atmosphere was good"
"2.0","Took an hour and a half when they said an hour. Forgot plates and napkins. Pizza was pretty plain."
"5.0","Juicy, tender, satisfying tacos and one of the very few taquerias in Pittsburgh that has meat options besides some form of basic chicken, beef, or pork--such as lengua, lamb, and shrimp. (I'm aware lengua comes from cows, but almost nowhere here offers it, and it's my favorite taco meat)."
"5.0","Great food!! I love their tacos and quesadillas. They just updated the menu too so there's some new options. I get the vegetarian quesadilla and it comes with great add ons. Delicious and fast for a lunch break downtown!"
"5.0","I found out about this place from my Uber Driver.    I had a few cocktails down the street that had great food but ate there a couple of days ago.  I needed a change of pace.I walked down to Doce Taqueria.   A small restaurant full of flavor and character.  Their menu is on a chalkboard above where the prepare the food.  They have maybe 8-10 seats in a counter type setting.The place is awesome.   I watched many patrons come in for to-go orders.  Since I was new, I requested the server to choose my selection of 3 tacos (corn tortilla).I had a beef, pork, and chicken taco.   The beef and chicken were really good but my favorite was the carnitas (pork).   Not only did the port have great flavor, they put all the accouterments that one could want.  All the ingredients were fresh and the meal had great flavor.Since they do not serve alcohol - I enjoyed a Mexican soda (Grapefruit) which tasted like a Sprite.The meal was so good - I order 3 more 'to-go'.  I explained to the server I would need to be wearing my sweat pants for the next 3 tacos ;-).   I really enjoyed the meal and would recommend you stop by and give this a try."
"4.0","Sausalido, I'm into you!What a cute little place! Again, I ponder why it took me so long to come here. Maybe it's a hidden gem?? Whatever it is, I can't wait to go back! Everything on the menu appealed to me, which is always a good sign. Oh yeah, also a good sign, deliciuos bread and hummus on the table!I was with a party of six and as soon as our food came out, I was struck by what a beautiful presentation it was. I mean, everything looked fresh and delicious, with a lovely looking plating to boot! I was in the mood for veggies, so I choose the roasted veggie wrap. It came LOADED with portabella mushrooms, red pepper, yellow squash, zucchini, asparagus, carrot, mixed greens, parmesan and white bean spread in a spinach tortilla. I also loved the balsamic dressing inside. It was just a nice refreshing meal for lunch. Not too heavy and definitely on the healthy side.I was VERY intrigued by the dinner menu though. I must come back soon to get some of the seasonal items (yum pumpkin!)."
"1.0","This is probably the worst experience I've ever had in a restaurant. Outside of the server, everything else was absolute trash. The morning shift didn't clean a damn thing on their way out the door. Left everything a mess for the dinner shift to handle. Unprofessional. What's worse is that it was slow and yet no one decided to clean. People were coming in for their shifts just standing around gossiping at the host stand. There were flies and moths flying around. We sat next to a dirty table the whole time we were there and we were there for an hour. That table was still dirty when we left. My sister ordered a burger cooked medium. What she actually got was medium-well to well done. I ordered a chicken sandwich which was a chore to chew. We came to Pittsburgh to see the baseball game and to come to this restaurant. I'm not sure who Jerome has running this place but I'm never coming back. This place is in a prime location and with his name attached to it, you'd think it'd be better run."
"4.0","My husband is a huge ramen fan so when we moved here this is one of the first places we checked out. We both kept it simple when ordering- I got the curry and he got the shio. I added the onsen egg but next time I would chose the nitamago egg instead. Both broths were delicious and did not need the butter ball add in but I would probably try it next time. We ended up with the server who was awful but the rest of the staff seemed to have the specials easily memorized and were speedy with getting plates and giving the check. We will definitely be back to try more (and will be keeping our fingers crossed for a different server)."
"4.0","Cool little ramen place in Lawrenceville. We went here for a late lunch and were very happy with the experience. We  sat in the main dining area which was nicely decorated with Asian-style wood paneling. The menu has approximately six different ramen options along with add-ons for the ramen, snacks and side dishes. We started with the fried cauliflower which was crispy and well flavored. I had the Dan Dan ramen for my main course which was also amazing. I decided to add some chili paste to increase the spice and didn't find it overpowering. The dish itself had kimchi and bits of tofu in it as well as a soft boiled egg. The noodles were fresh and the broth was very savory. Service was attentive and prompt throughout our meal. Overall, very happy with the experience and would definitely go again."
"5.0","Roethlisberger w/ bacon and pepper relish."
"5.0","We ate outside and the atmosphere was perfect. Boats driving by, the breeze and the water. The crab legs were big and hot when they got to the table plus they were cooked perfectly. We'll be back again!"
"5.0","All I can say is this is my favorite spot for taco's. I can sit here and rave about it, but you seriously need to go try it out for yourself. The staff is so cool and friendly, you cant beat these prices and it is super clean. The food is always fresh and the cook will always answer any questions with an upbeat attitude. I cant say enough great things about this place. The pork taco is by far my favorite, but they offer many other options including chicken, beef and a veggie taco as well as nachos, beans, and now chili."
"4.0","Great steak sandwich! They are kind of in a bad place due to road construction, go see them for take out great lunch!"
"3.0","Came in for a birthday dinner. We made reservations and glad we did. Arriving at 7:15, the place was packed. We were quickly seated and a waiter saw our wine bottle (it's BYOB) and opened it for us.We ordered the prosciutto pickle spears. Hubs wanted the tuna and I opted for the crab cakes, but alas no tuna was available. Hubs wanted risotto, so I swapped for the duck so he could get the crab cakes. All is well in the world again.Bread, with bean dip and balsamic arrives. It's an interesting option and we enjoyed it. The prosciutto pickle spears arrive and we were surprised to see full pickles. We had imagine the little pickles. As such, the prosciutto was overpowered by the pickle. It was still tasty, but not something I could have a lot of. The salads arrive and is a good mix of lettuce, tomato, cucumber, salad, and chickpeas. I didn't realize we were getting salads with the meals and I would have specified dry. Not a fan of oil or dressing on salads. I made do.We finished the salads and wait. Our entrees are taking a bit. Hubs go to the restroom and overhears a manager yelling at the kitchen staff that he needs those crab cakes out now. Now we know the hang up and why others who came after us got their entrees first. They could have told us and we could have ordered something else, but no one did. At this point, we're almost finished with our bottle of wine. We preserve the final glass for the entrees. When they came, the crab cakes were sizable and with good flavor. The duck was good, but fatty. There was little meat, leaving me a bit hungry, so I stole some crab cake. The risotto was underwhelming and not cooked well. It tasted like standard rice and not the care required in slow cooking risotto.As we were wrapping up, the waitress offers a dessert since it's a birthday dinner. I opted for the flourless chocolate cake. It's dense and tasty. Perfect way to cap it off.We were hoping to head out as it is now 9:40. We've been there for while. The waitress is talking to other guests for 10 minutes, so we were waiting again to get the check. It's a swift process and we head out. The food is good, with plenty of options. The service was spotty and we weren't sure what to make of it. They were friendly, but we didn't get the wait and such."
"4.0","I like this place!!!! I hope I can try more Korean food over here. The service is good as well"
"5.0","Delicious, affordable indian food. For 10 people, we ordered 6 dishes (that came with rice) and 4 orders of naan. We maybe could have ordered 1-2 more dishes, but we were super hungry. The food was fresh and flavorful. We ordered the chicken tikka masala (2), lamb curry, lamb vindaloo, tandoori chicken and paneer tikka makni. The tandoori chicken was so flavorful! We'll definitely come back for the lunch buffet. They also do delivery through grubhub!"
"4.0","Not Bad , But averaged $1.15 per WING !!!  Nice selection of flavors , kinda greasy but good. I ordered the louisiana licker sauce. ( you know , something different ) And i ate too damn many. now my tummie hurts ! LOL"
"5.0","I've been here three times in the last couple months. I start craving it after couple weeks. Soooooooo good!!!!"
"4.0","I am definitely not the type of girl that frequents fancy restaurants. Only because I feel like sometimes they can be over hyped. However, I was not disappointed with my lunch at The Capital Grille. A few co-workers and I randomly set up a reservation 10 minutes prior to walking in the door and we were seated right away. It really is a beautiful restaurant and the service was just as I had hoped it would be. Our waitress asked us before we ordered if we were on a time constraints which I thought was really nice. It made me feel like they would be willing to accommodate us if we needed it to be a quick lunch, but we didn't. They brought out fresh bread to the table and it was amazing! It was so fresh that it was still steaming from coming out of the oven. I decided to order from one of their lunch specials which included an entree and soup for $20. I kept going back and forth between the steak sandwiches and truffle fries and the shrimp butternut squash risotto. I ended up picking the shrimp only because our waitress described it as tasting like fall in a dish and boy was she right! The shrimp were huge and cooked/seasoned perfectly and was a great accompaniment to the risotto. For my soup I almost ordered the clam chowder, but then she mentioned they had lobster bisque for an additional $5. I am so happy I went with the lobster bisque. Definitely one of the best in Pittsburgh! I would highly recommend this place for lunch and look forward to coming back in the future."
"4.0","Pricey, but the salads are good.It's not that the bagels cost a lot or anything they're just priced more like a movie theater.  You just don't expect a salad and a large lemonade to run $10 but it does at brueggers.That said the food is generally on the better end of quality for fast food and the staff here are polite and attentive.  If you're watching calories and work on the southside there aren't many options that work.  This is one of them."
"2.0","In my opinion, the is a prime example of a bad Shadyside bar. It's right on Walnut, too small, always too crowded, and I feel like I'm a 21-yr old college student when I go out there. It's miserable to be there on the weekend when it's so crowded because it's such a small space. The only reason I'm giving this bar 2 instead of 1 star is because the karaoke on Fridays (if you can handle the people and the crowd) is pretty good- although there are half a dozen better places to karaoke in Pittsburgh. Furthermore, I have sat on the patio table for a nice chill happy hour once watching the craziness of Walnut Street happen in front of me- which was oddly relaxing."
"1.0","This is the 2nd time we've gone here and had a bad experience.  The first time, my husband got the fajitas.  They came out cold, gave him two small slices of pepper, and barely a chicken breast.  He asked to talk to the manager and she gave him ridiculous attitude for complaining ( he never complains at restaurants) and was unapologetic.  We decided to give it another try.  For the Pirate home opener they said the 'special' was a $5 Miller lite draft with a pirate cup.  We were still charged $5 for the special despite the restaurant not having the Pirate cup.  We asked about it (our waiter didn't even tell us) and he said 'it's been 2 months and they haven't come in yet'.  We then got our bill and were charged full price.  I would think again when going to this bar.  They have high prices for less than quality food and they have false advertising on their so-called 'drink specials'."
"4.0","I've been wanting to return for the awesome Caffe Mona brunch for a while - in fact I can't believe it's been so long since we've been here. After reading some less than stellar reviews I felt compelled to jump in and send Caffe Mona some love!This place is incredibly cute - very European inspired, brick walls, wooden tables & an awesome back patio. Reminds me very much of Birchwood Kitchen in Chicago, which I love! Plus they have a killer location literally right across the street from Children's Hospital. The $13.99 prix fixe brunch menu was an exciting thing to find. The only thing that could have made it better would have been knowing it was BYOB before we went. Nothing better with a tasty brunch than a good bottle of champagne, although their coffee was pretty darned delicious.I started off brunch with a fresh fruit plate and everything served was in season, ripe & juicy. Great start. Then I was served a dish that made my eyes roll back in my head (even without the champs)! The savory French toast topped with house made fig jam, Brie that was super creamy & buttery and Granny Smith Apples was absolutely superb. The flavor combinations complemented each other perfectly and I only shared a couple of bites with hubby & devoured the rest. I was totally stuffed when the final item, an apricot jam crepe, was placed in front of me. Sad to say, they should have skipped this item. It was crunchy & pretty flavorless. I couldn't have eaten it anyway, but based on the rest of the meal it just didn't compare. Next visit, I'll have a hard time not ordering that French Toast again & you can bet there will be champagne!"
"3.0","This place is good for one or two occasions, but after having gone there once a week for the past two months, I'd definitely say I won't be craving Indian food for a while. The price is fair for the buffets, and the food is good, but the taste just all melts together after a plate in, and the spices can't be differentiated. The staff is friendly, and the ambiance is intimate."
"1.0","We walked in and before we were fully seated the server asked if we were ready to order. We asked for a minute to look over the menu and literally never saw her again. We waited for 20 minutes before just getting up and leaving. We also had our baby with us, which doesn't demand special treatment necessarily - but I always appreciate a server who understands how helpful it is to be prompt when you have young children with you. To add insult, the other server working was leaning on the bar on her phone and the restaurant wasn't very busy - a total of 4 tables sat."
"5.0","I absolutely love the strip district in Pittsburgh. It feels kind of like you're in the scene when Rocky is running through the Italian market in Philly. These people are related to the Wholey's fish market people down the street, but the two businesses are not affiliated. With that said, the food was incredibly fresh and everything was seasoned perfectly. The outdoor dining set up with the removable back wall was in place and made for a lovely little afternoon snack. Definitely a must try if you're in the mood for good fish while in Pittsburgh."
"5.0","I love this place. It's our go to spot for a quick lunch at work. I highly recommend pretty much everything.  The chicken burger is my favorite and I avoid eating the massive quantity of rice that is served with the options on the hot bar."
"3.0","Thai food is one of the easiest to make ethnic foods at your home and have it taste fairly authentic. So I generally rate Thai restaurants on how does their dish they make compare to how I have had in Thailand and how I make it at home. While the food at Thai Gourmet is edible, although greasy, my companion agreed that I could make better dishes than this. Now that does not constitute a put-down or I'm trying to say that the food sucked - it didn't it was good. (It's really hard to make Thai food poorly IMHO) However, as another poster said, they seem to know they have strong competition down the street where you get incredible food so they are trying to win on the portion size and value while the quality is not quite there.Take the 3 star rating for what's it worth, the food is OK but there are much better places to go."
"4.0","Love this place. Great dive bar with a pretty good beer selection to-go. Nice bartenders, but don't go crazy on cocktail requests (stick to beer, it's hard to mess that up). Pretzels are pretty great, but I haven't tried much more food than that."
"5.0","This place is the best. Menu is constantly changing and evolving, with daily specials and new menu items popping up all the time. They are so accommodating for vegetarians, vegans and those gluten-free as well. All menu items clearly marked with a 'V' and most vegetarian items are able to be made vegan. More recently they've even expanded the offerings and now have a vegan kimchi option, and the daily veggie bao bun is vegan friendly 99% of the time. Love dining here with a large group in the main dining area, or just popping in the back bar area for a late night bite. The staff truly is so kind and welcoming, always willing to answer any questions, accommodate for any dietary needs, and offer suggestions on what they recommend. They also have an extensive drink menu including local beer on draft and in cans, traditional Japanese-style beers, warm sake, specialty cocktails, and a great wine selection as well. Ramen is always served piping hot and is quite the generous portion, appetizers may not be necessary but everything is so darn good, it's hard to pass up a starter. Lately this has been my go-to dinner spot to bring out of town guests, and it is always a huge hit!"
"3.0","A trendy Japanese spot with many different options from sushi to ramen/noodle dishes to seafood to other izakaya dishes. We got takoyaki, a grilled fish special, udon noodles, and a savory egg custard. All were good, though the fish was very underwhelming and not that tasty for the $18 that it cost - it was accurate in the description given by our server, but we were hoping for more of a miso cod style dish (which is not on this menu - I hope they add it!)Note that if you go during dinnertime, you'll be surrounded by red lighting. Not ideal for food pornos."
"2.0","I gave two stars because the pizza is decent; however, they NEED a handicap accessible entrance. It's 2019, I can't believe this still wasn't considered. There was an incident last night where a gentleman fell due to the lack of accessibility and my heart broke for him. This is simply unacceptable."
"5.0","This is an unexpected, hidden gem in South Side. For pizza aficionados this is where you want to grab your next slice of pizza."
"5.0","I came here with a group of 8 and the service was amazing. We did have a bit of a wait even though we had a reservation, but it wasn't unreasonable for such a large group on a weekend. They were courteous enough to call earlier in the day to let us know that we would have to wait. We started with bread and bean dip that was delicious, but the smoked gouda was my favorite appetizer. Everyone ordered something different so I got to taste a few different things and everything was seasoned/ cooked to perfection. It's also BYOB, so don't forget to bring a bottle of wine to have with your meal (or a 6 pack of beer if you're like me). I'll definitely be back here becausr they have just enough vegetarian options to leep me interested. The mushroom risotto was my favorite entree."
"3.0","Great place for a quick bite and very pocket-friendly and nice and fast service.The only complaint I have in the inconsistency on the spice level. Some days, the mild is all sugary and some days too spicey. Same for the medium level. Today I noticed that one of the cooks added the spices in the chicken marinated bowls by freehand and he also had to run in between to check e fryers. Some consistency would be nice.Overall, I highly recommend this place for anyone craving fried chicken. They use peanut oil for frying which is great."
"5.0","I love this place. I come here multiple times a week, but what prompted me to write this review was something that stands out as amazing customer service. The last time I visited Doce there was an issue with my boyfriends order. We called the restaurant and not only did they immediately rectify the situation (refunded our rather large order) but the next time I came in they gave me a generous gift card for future visits. The employees and management really went way above and beyond to make up for the incident in a way not many restaurants still do. That is why I love this place ..great food from people who appreciate their customers..I'll be back ..probably tomorrow ..oh yeah they have amazing tacos too"
"4.0","Came in with a friend on a Saturday night and we were immediately seated, which is nice. The waitress was informative about the menu, but a little slow with service. She also forgot to ring in my bao bun, causing a delay with my food.Food was really nice, I opted for the inferno ramen with kimchi replacing the egg. The ramen was good and spicy, but the brisket was too fatty for my taste. I also had a pork belly bao bun, which was AMAZING. The pork was cooked perfectly and the bao was delicious. I have never had a steamed bun where they sear the edges and make the bun a little crispy, and I really enjoyed it."
"5.0","Best place to get a Greek salad in town! Really fast service and giant portions for a fair price. Their homemade vinaigrette is outstanding! I go here for lunch all the time."
"5.0","By far the best tacos in Pittsburgh! Order the barbacoa,carnitas,or fish tacos! They are very authentic and I love that you can customize them with your own salsa at the salsa bar. Highly recommend going to the strip just for the tacos here!"
"4.0","Came here on a Saturday night. Not over crowded, able to get a table. Basic hotdogs and fries menu with a variety of toppings to choose from. If you love beer, this is the place for you. Good service. Good food. Open late."
"5.0","I went to caffe Mona for brunch and had an amazing experience. I ordered the Elvis crepe and an iced chai latte, both of which were amazing. I ate on their back porch which is covered with colorful umbrellas and perfect for a sunny summer day. The staff were extremely welcoming and nice and made great recommendations. The owner, Eto, made sure to come by our table more than once to check up on us and brought us complimentary desert. It was a great experience and I will for sure be coming back soon."
"2.0","The staff here was very friendly and the sandwich was alright.  Portion sizes were pretty small though for the price and the apple they gave me seemed like it was chewed up by a dog (no joke.  There were brown teeth/gnawing marks on one side of the apple).  If it wasn't for the apple, I probably would've given three stars."
"2.0","I have intended to dine at Coca Cafe for brunch for at least 2-3 years because so many people said good things about this place. So my friend and I decided to just wake up early, arrive right when it opens, and try to beat the brunch crowd. We get there at about 9:20am and were told that there would be a 30-40 minute wait. Great. But we didn't come for nothing, so we put our name and number down and took a stroll down the street while we waited for our table. On a typical day, I would have ordered a few other things on the menu before the one I actually ended up ordering: the eggplant benedict. I don't often like eggplant that much, so perhaps it is my fault that I didn't enjoy it, but in my defense, Coca Cafe seemed to be one of those places where everything would be good, so I thought I couldn't go wrong with any of the items on the menu. I ended up just eating barely half of it and the potatoes and fruit. Unfortunately, for me, Coca Cafe wasn't worth the wait. Taste | 2Atmosphere | 3Presentation | 3Service | 3OVERALL | 2.5"
"4.0","I've been here about four or six times. More than enough to form an opinion about it. Their ramens are delicious and have a variety of extras you can add to them. My only reason for the lack of 5 stars is, after having tried several bowls, their ramen broths dishes don't seem terribly different from one another. If you're itching for a bowl of noodles of any kind, you won't be disappointed. If you come one a weekend, come early or bring your patience with you. They get packed!"
"4.0","Really enjoyed this BYOB Viatnemese noodle spot. Wife got the pho with beef and basil leaves and I got the coconut broth vermicelli noodles with shrimp and mixed meats. Vermicelli was decent, a bit sweet, but really good.  The pho was outstanding, though. Rich broth was simple, but really tasty."
"4.0","I stopped by here a couple of Friday nights ago with my wife for dinner.  We knew that we were going to be downtown on this evening and so picked out that we wanted to head to Las Velas a couple of days before hand.  Part of my motivation is that it was in the Enjoy book but I also remember having some good food here in the past.  Las Velas is located on the second floor of a building and can be a bit tricky to find if you don't know where to look.  Hint, it's between the diamond market and the original oyster house.  In any case after heading up the stairs we were greeted by a hostess and sat at the last table available.  Due to that, I can't say that it was the greatest table or that I could see much of the restaurant.  We were seated without a wait though and so you won't see me complaining.For dinner on this day my wife and I decided I split the chips and salsa (bottomless) for an appetizer.  After looking over the menu for awhile I also decided to go with the most expensive thing on the menu, the  velada.  While it sounded good on its own, I was also influenced a little bit by the little fire sign next to it which I assumed meant spicy.  Our chips and salsa came out first and I rather enjoyed them.  The chips seemed to be freshly made and the salsa was blended quite smooth and was flavorful.  As we were on our second basket of chips our entrees came out.  What I wasn't expecting was the show that came along with my food.  It was described on the menu as half of fresh pineapple shell filled with chicken, steak, shrimp, chorizo, grilled peppers, onions and cilantro all topped with melted cheese and served with sides of tortillas, guacamole, sour cream and pick de gallo.  What it failed to mention is that there is a tequila sauce that is prepared table side and then poured over the dish.  This preparation consists of the tequila being added to the sauce and then lit on fire before being poured between two gravy boats until the alcohol was burned off.  Overall it was a pretty cool presentation that I can't say I was ready for.  The sauce they made from it was dynamite though and had a nice tequila flavor with most of the alcohol being gone.  Everything in my dish was delicious, especially whenever it was combined with that sauce.  I think my favorite of the meats was the shrimp (I got 3 of them) due to their natural sweetness.The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Both my wife and I enjoyed our food and the dining room has a nice view over Market Square."

We placed our online order at 11:45 for two sandwiches and two bags of chips. About an hour later we saw on the website that our food was out for delivery so we waited in the lobby of my building for the delivery guy. At 12:45 I called Jimmy John's to see where our food was and the person on the phone said they attempted one delivery and no one was there to receive it so it had to be redeployed, he assured me our food would arrive in 5-10 more minutes. My office has a security desk that someone sits at 24/7 so I knew that wasn't true and we were sitting down there waiting! Fast forward 15 minutes, still no food so we went back to our desks and called Jimmy John's again, this time he told her our food has been out for delivery for 30 mins and it should arrive soon. It is now 1:20pm and I haven't had any lunch so we decide to go get something else and when I walk into the lobby of my building the delivery man is there with two subs in a bag that has dirt on it and there are no chips. We accept the food and go back up to our floor to eat it. I opened the paper that my sub was wrapped in and there is sauce all over the place which then gets all over my desk. I am assuming it was made 2 hours ago and was in the delivery mans bag the entire time. I was very disappointed by the lack of communication from the staff at Jimmy John's, the two hour wait for our food, and them forgetting part of our order. This experience was not freaky fast, it was just annoying."
"5.0","I really, really love Umami. I never go with more than 2-3 people, so we get seated pretty quickly even on a Saturday night. I do highly recommend making a reservation, though! This tiny place gets crowded quickly. I get the same thing every time I come in. Waygu beef, fried chicken skin, bacon wrapped quail egg, and the tonkatsu ramen. I also grab anything fruity on their rotating cocktail menu, and I'm never disappointed! The food comes out quickly, always hot and just beautiful. The staff is always friendly and lends recommendations when needed. Can't wait to go back!"
"4.0","The Nepali dishes are excellent. Similar to Indian, spicy but not excessively so. Personally I'd skip the Chinese dishes; there are many better Chinese places in Pittsburgh. I had the Nepalese lamb, which is a great choice served with a nice pile of rice and six sides/sauces and a little rice pudding-like dessert.The building itself isn't as good as the food, so don't take a date or a business associate here. Think 'Pittsburgh dive bar aesthetic' and you'll be fine. The entrance is a little creepy and immediately you have to walk up a flight of stairs. Cardboard makeshift repairs on the ceiling and a cracked window. Mmm, ok, but thanks to positive Yelp reviews I stayed and did indeed enjoy my lunch."
"4.0","I ordered a steak salad. The price was about $8. It was definitely not high-quality steak, but the taste was good for the price. The employees were also nice. They are cash-only."

"5.0","This is my first review ever. While at work, we've tried a lot of places in Oakland. This has been my favorite pizza place in the 8 years I've worked here! We ordered hushpuppies, the BBQ chicken pizza and the Bianco pizza. The food was phenomenal, the delivery was fast and friendly. We will continue to order from here!"
"5.0","Cinderlands has great beer and interesting bar food.We had each of the beers on tap. Our IPA friend liked the IPA and our Ale friend enjoyed the Ale. I'm not quite as picky. Each beer was good. The crowler (mini-growler can) option was nice for taking some to go if you forgot your growler or want a smaller volume to go.We only had appetizers. The scotch eggs were amazing. It was super crispy and the mustard was fantastic. It was really unexpected to see a soft boiled egg inside but really worked. If your a scotch egg person, you've got to try one.As a note, we visited once during the Lawrenceville cookie tour. They had fantastic cookies. The cookies are sadly not on the menu."
"3.0","I'm lol'ing at some of the reviews here. People going on about freaking miso soup. 'Immortalizing the ingredients.' 'Exquisite.' Get a grip, people. Let me give it to you straight:- This place is better than you'd think for being in a touristy area. - It probably has the best sushi in Pittsburgh except for Umi.- But in any other big city it would probably be right in the middle of the pack- The fish quality is good- The assembly is poor (e.g. sloppy rolls, crumbling rice)If you've never had sushi in your life, this place is 5 stars. Otherwise, nothing to see here."
"4.0","Food was superb!  Service was 'slightly slow' not with the food but afterwards getting the check."
"5.0","Delicious food, nice variety on the menu. Small, family run places are the best!  Tasty homemade sauce for the fresh rollsMy favorite is the Lemongrass Chicken (#9). Nice size portions. Good service. Only bad point is it's cash only but worth a trip to the ATM."
"5.0","My wife and I went here this past Friday for dinner and it was a great experience.We made reservations for 6 PM, got there about 10 minutes early and were seated right away. Our server was attentive, prompt and conscientious. At her recommendation, I tried the Spanish Martini which was really good - not overpowering whatsoever. My wife had the sangria which was also good,  tasting subtly of star anise if you're into that.As for the meal itself, we enjoyed all of our selections thoroughly and had no complaints. We tried the blood sausage and oxtail (montaditos), the goat cheese croquettes, duck leg (plate) and the rib platter. While small, the duck was cooked perfectly and fell right off the bone. The ribs were meaty, crispy on the outside and tender and flavorful on the inside. By the end of dinner we were both comfortably full.To avoid a potential complaint of waiting a long time between courses, I'd suggest knowing what you would like to try ahead of time and ordering it all at once as opposed ordering a couple items at a time. We picked out our courses the night before, ordered them at the beginning and the pace of our meal was just right. Also,to avoid the potential pitfall of small-plate post-meal hunger, picking a platter and 4 other items was just right for 2 people.j"
"4.0","3.5 stars overall----please ready whyThe food here is fantastic and the prices are more than reasonable. It has a relatively small menu but they are allergy friendly. Waitstaff is fine as are the portion sized.But what's not to like? Well, at Girasole reservations for 6:30 does not mean that you will get seated at about 6:30-6:45, but rather you will likely get seated sometime that evening, which could 1-2 hours later. While waiting for your 'reservations' we saw several group with 'reservations' being turned away because they were too booked. This appears to be the norm here and the owner can get quite testy if called on it. The noise level is a bit much as well and I would not want the table near the main entrance."
"1.0","Had a terrible experience, Caucasian male server was very rude. Although he was not our original server I asked him to order an appetizer for me. He stated that he couldn't and to ask any other server. When I asked him to get my server he said he was busy, couldn't and walked away. I was taken aback...  That was service... Food is unnecessarily expensive! 1 samosa cost $2.  Five pieces of friend paneer was $4... not worth it. Bad service and bad prices! Avoid!"
"5.0","Went to this place with my colleagues as were in town for work. We had to drive around twice to get the valet parking as the place was packed. This was sign that a right place was picked for dinner.Food- We were eight people so ordered a lot of items from each section so get ready to read a long review! Appetizers:Pan fried Calamari with hot cherry peppers- As the name suggests it was hot. It was not too crispy and little on the softer side. But the flavor and taste was really good. I would give it 4/5 because I like calamari a little crispy. There is no sauce that comes with it so if you want one,you need to ask. A few of my co-workers could not handle the spice so if you don't eat medium spicy,this is not for you!Pork belly with tomato jam- the portion was really small like really small which was good I think as the dish was not too good in taste. It tasted soggy and the tomato jam was overpowering the bacon taste. I would not recommend it personally.Truffle fries- I would say that this was my favorite out of all the appetizers! A must try! The portions are not too bad either and good enough to share with 2-3 people.Brussels sprouts with bacon- Perfect amount of oil and flavor. Nothing too fancy or unique, if you don't want anything else then sure go for it otherwise there are better options like the fries!They also serve various kinds of breads which also fills you up so decide your appetizers accordingly.Main course: I do not eat steak so I decided to go with Chilean sea bass with mushroom soy broth- it was good, the broth had a nice aroma and was tasting perfect with the fish! So if you like something with not too much spices, do not eat steak and want something very neutral in taste and easy to finish then I would recommend this.My co-workers ordered steak but they had one comment in common that even medium rare was overdone which reduced the juice and flavor. I have no comments on that as I know nothing about steak!Sides:- Lobster Mac and cheese- The lobster comes in giant pieces mixed in Mac and cheese. I was expecting very small pieces mixed well in Mac and cheese but that was not the case. The taste was good, top was crispy, and it's Mac and cheese (I don't know what else to say). Definitely recommended!- Mashed potatoes - it made a good side for people who ordered steak as Steak does not come with any side. It was good and definitely worth getting if you are getting steak.- Asparagus - I thought it was very oily so I couldn't eat more than one bite. I could taste the oil. Dessert:- New York cheese cake - We ordered that because they had no more Creme Brûlée but the top part tasted exactly the same. 4/5- Warm Double chocolate cake- it's chocolate lava cake with ice cream on the side. I love chocolate so I would say that this was my fav dessert! 5/5- Fruit sorbet - I did not like it much, found it too tangy but I guess it's because I am not a sorbet fan. But there are better options in my opinion so why go for this!- Trio of handcrafted ice creams- This does not come with 'cookies' as the description says! There was this one biscotti looking cookie that is very hard to break and three ice creams with one scoop each. Drinks- They have a good wine list! I got the Cabernet - 'Frank' , liked it! Overall comments - The service was great, ambience was really good, good music in the background , our server was very attentive and very honest about the recommendations. I would definitely recommend it as a good place for a special occasion, date night, or work lunches/dinners. It is definitely pricey but the service, food, ambience is equal to the price. Sorry, I only have 2 pictures to share - My main course and the chocolate dessert! Cheers and live,laugh and love!"
"3.0","We came in on a Sunday early in the evening and had the place to ourselves. First impression was that it was a bar that allowed smoking. We sat in uncomfortable chairs as we trudged through dinner. Had the chicken and striped bass. The crispy skin chicken was really good. The striped bass was almost too salty to eat. As others have posted, the price for the quality you get doesn't add up here."
"5.0","Our server Sharon was so amazing!  She made great suggestions and had the best personality!  She made us feel very comfortable and made my son feel like a rock star!"
"5.0","The funny thing about these reviews is they all talk about the $5 pizza. That only starts after 8pm and only started 7 years ago. Sorrentos has been open 40+ years and has a thriving day time business as well. The hoagies are great, they make their own marinara, lasagna and meatballs which are all great and the Sicilian puzza is probablythe best I ever had. There's no doubt in my mind Sorrento is in the top 10 shops in Pittsburgh."
"1.0","Third time I've come here for food and the kitchen was not open during the posted business hours. The tap beer is stale. When I asked the worker what's going on, he tells me the owner doesn't care about the kitchen or the bar and just wants to run a take out beer place. Also, the take out beer is extremely over priced. Local distributors have the same 12 packs to go for $2-$3 less. Awful business! Do not support this place!"
"4.0","Always a line but moves very quickly. The place is clean and super cute. So many choices on the board but when the daily specials are gone your out of luck. So get there early if you can! Pancakes are off the charts!! Eggs and brisket hash was a great choice too. I ordered an omelette and it was perfect. Lots of food. But get pancakes to share then order something else so you can have a taste of everything!!"
"1.0","THEY DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND WALK TWO DOORS DOWN TO PRIORY FINE PASTRIES.   Came into Arnold's tea today with a trained ESA (emotional support animal) the African American woman behind the counter berated me and my friend. Claiming if we didn't have paperwork we would not be allowed in the store. As we were getting the documentation that my friend needed the animal for her panic attacks the woman said that we would need to wait outside while we did that. This place is discriminatory against people with disabilities and so we took our money and our ESA down the street to Piories Fine Pasties. The coffee is amazing, the sweets are delicious and you are greeted with a smile and respect."
"3.0","This review is based solely on the Burning Bridges Comedy Club part of Hambones. One major critique is that they need a door!! I could only half pay attention to the comedians because all I could hear in the background is everyone singing Journey in the bar, and Biggie, and all of the other things they were jamming. Also, there was only one waiter for everyone, so I was only able to get one drink the whole time since he was so busy.The comedy was good. The headliner was the best, which is how it's supposed to be. There was a heckler in the crowd and they handled it well. He eventually realized he was ruining the show for everyone and shut up. I love going to comedy shows and would like to go back, but I sure hope they end up installing a door!! I would just get my drinks at the bar next time."
"4.0","Decent lunch options and tasted really fresh and delicious. I had the prosciutto sandwich with a green salad. Also tried part of their club sandwich.  Both were a home run. Would definitely return again."

"3.0","I went to Cafe Raymond for the first time the other day.It is in the strip district and parking can be a challenge.I see a ton of 5 star reviews and I have to say for me at least I was a bit surprised.My first impression walking in was Cafe Raymond was a nice looking place and staff seemed very nice.Then I found out you had to go to register first and order then sit down and wait for food.This is not your typical diner were you sit and a waiter or waitress takes your order.Once you order at the counter they give you a number stand to put at table so they know were to serve food.To be honest when it comes to breakfast I am not that adventurous, I order the same thing all the time.I had 2 eggs over easy and bacon and home fires and white toast.The coffee is served at the table but if you need milk or sugar you have to get up and go to the area that has that.The coffee was a bit bitter for my taste I really did not like it at all.The meal itself was ok, The eggs were cooked fine and tasted fine.The bacon was ok nothing special.The wait staff and cashier were very friendly and very helpful.The service was excellent overall.Unfortuanlty I do not think I would not go back again unless my wife wanted to.I like sitting down and someone taking my order and then being served.I do not like waiting at the cashier to order first then sitting down and then having to get up to do your coffee.Cafe Raymond was not for me at all.overall the service was excellent, The place was clean and well run.MY only big complaint is the waiting at the register to order & the coffee was terrible.I would of given Cafe Raymond 2 stars , But the food and service was good overall so ill give them 3 stars."
"4.0","I went to Thai Gourmet because my other favorite Thai place was closed on Monday. I called to order pick up. The food was ready when I got there. I ordered the Pad Thai. The food was okay. Not the best Thai I've ever had but it was so-so. They gave me a little brownie as dessert that was pretty good. Overall it was good. I'd still go there again."
"1.0","I had such high hopes for this place. The online menu seems amazing with so many delicious brunch options ranging from sweet to savory. Despite some of the negative reviews given to this place, I thought maybe I'll get luckier. However, my experience was a complete disaster. The location is great, right on a main street. The café is spacious with plenty of lighting. However, they did not make very good use of the space. The décors were all over place with Christmas, spring and summer themes going on at the same time. The service was awful as well. The server was inattentive, rude when we asked for an extra minute to look over the menu and he mixed up our order when the food came out.The food took exactly 40 minutes to arrive to our table. There were only two occupied tables in the entire café so there should be no excuse for taking that long. I ordered the Caffe Crepe with chicken, apples, avocado and melted brie. The chicken was overcooked and super bland with no seasoning at all. There were no avocados in my crepe. The only thing I could taste was the brie. The crepe was so horrible and tasteless that I could not finish it. Each bite was a complete struggle and I had to fight to keep my food down. The food was bad. The service was bad. The experience was overall bad. I am ashamed for bringing my dining companions here. Caffe Mona, never again."
"3.0","I used to really, really, REALLY like Pamela's. The crepe-like pancakes are my favorites in Pittsburgh and nothing will ever change that. I like 'em plain, with none of that sugary nonsense rolled in the middle. The croissant french toast is also another amazing dish, but sort of lame because it comes with no sides. The majority of the rest of the food is horribly underseasoned. That corned beef hash was an absolute joke. It's legit just the regular potatoes with corned beef sprinkled in, not cooked to meld all the flavors or anything. As of late, coming to Pamela's is a hassle. The crowded seating, the rushed and inattentive service, and the cash only system all really bother me. If you're gonna visit, go for breakfast and don't get your hopes up about much else."
"1.0","The food was ok but the service was awful.  Our server Madelyn took our drink order and brought it.  Then took the food order and did not come back. We had to ask where our food was 45 minutes later.  After eating we called her over and asked for the bill. Of course she did not bring it. When asked again for it her comment was    Do you have some where to be !!   We had 2 small children that was over done with waiting We will not be back !!!!"
"5.0","Capital always does such a nice job, I've honestly never had anything except a great experience here. I normally prefer to sit in the bar/lounge area, but most recently had dinner in the dining room, which turned out to be a better choice bc the bar was PACKED. Our server, Matt, was great- the service was intuitive and playful. He recommended and accommodated as needed. Everything is always delicious, obviously steak is their specialty.... but another highlight is the lobster mac n cheese, its amazing! Also, try the Stoli Doli cocktail, it's their signature. But go easy, it's stronger than it tastes! All in all, It's a high end chain steakhouse, right, and in a city filled with so many unique & independent places you might not think of Capital, however, it's predictably excellent and you won't be disappointed."
"5.0","Ordered Kathy's Tailgate catering Special for my son's birthday party and couldn't have been happier. The order placement was quick and convenient and the food was delicious. For ten dollars per person we received five different types of artisanal sandwiches with the best quality meats, breads and cheeses, awesome bow tie/spinach/tomato pasta salad and a mixed greens salad with all sorts of fancy fixings. I would have never been able to replicate this menu for the same cost on my own. I'd recommend Sausalido's catering to anyone."
"5.0","Talk about a true hidden gem... this place is a small bar/restaurant with great food and a sweet story to match. It's not really hidden, but don't be fooled by it'd exterior. It just looks like any other bar from the outside, not a fantastic Hungarian restaurant with amazing food and pastries. I had the Chicken paprikas and split the cucumber salad with the BF; he had Gypsy pork loin. We got the cucumber salad with the sour cream and the sauce was so good li wanted to lick the plate. The chicken paprikas was equally as delish. Right across from our table was a big case of the prettiest parties, and needless to say I got about $20 worth. They also has a selection of Hungarian beers and wines, if that's your thing. This place is great for everyone, but for someone with a Hungarian background to meet the owner and hear her story...it really makes it special."
"2.0","RUSHING customers and CHEAP service!My coworkers and I have been there several times before, but this time I realized how their servers just need some basic training on how to properly treat customers. In terms of food, I give them a 3.5 stars, but the service is 1 star and I would recommend everyone to think 2x before going, especially during lunch rush.We first arrived when the restaurant was still relatively empty, and after we ordered food it started to get packed and the server also started to rush us. After waiting for 10-15mins for our entrée, literally within 5 minutes of getting our food she came to give us our bill! I totally understand if she just left it there and wait for us to pay, but after another 10 mins she came back AGAIN and told each of us 'here's your bill' as if we're blind that we didn't see it the first time. If this is not a sign to rush us out the door, I don't know what is. Giving us 15 mins to eat our food when it took you 10mins to serve it does not seem like the right way to treat customers.In addition, we ordered one salsa and one queso for three people as appetizer and we were served 1 portion of chips. That's okay because we thought we could get more. But then we didn't ask for more until the end where she already rushed us to pay the check, and at that point the server said we could not get anymore because it's only for dine in. Thanks for giving us one order of chips for three of us with 2 sauces and not letting us get some more at the end for to-go. Now we have about a whole bowl of sauce left with less than 10 c hips! If only we asked for it before we paid, she could have given it to us..but we'd just pack it to go anyways. So what's the difference?! It's just rude....if you want your restaurant to be more empty during lunch hour, well, your wish came true.Let's just say there are also items we found in the food we didn't complain about or the missing food items that we let go of."
"5.0","Awesome food. It's great to have a tasty vegan option. I'm no vegan and it didn't feel like a compromise to eat here."
"4.0","Redbeard's on Sixth is one of my favorite downtown bars.  It's got your basic bar food and a good draft list.  It's nice and clean but without a lot of bells and whistles other downtown bars think they need.Service is friendly.  Redbeard's is one of my standard reliable places for pre- or post-game drinks.  This place gets four stars just for having my essentials."

"5.0","If you haven't tried Luke Wholey's you are missing out on the freshest/finest seafood in the Burgh!  Our waiter Drew told us in all of his years as a server (17 yrs.) he has never worked in a place where they got their seafood and fish in 3 times a day...The Calamari appetizer was light, crunchy and cooked to perfection...it was served with an amazing marinara sauce on top of a bed of arugula...I opted for the Baja Shrimp and Scallops which was served on jasmine rice and drizzled with a sweet soy based sauce in just the right proportion...it was amazing!  My husband chose the Imperial sword fish...blackened and topped with a generous portion of Colossal crab, he raved about it...both entree's were served with grilled fresh asparagus...Portions were just right and prices followed suit....very reasonable!  The atmosphere was pleasant, service was great...a definite go to whether it's a special occasion or just a night out...We'll be back!"
"3.0","Disappointing evening.The Capital Grille has always been our go-to place for special events and whenever we can escape from the kids.Last night was a special night for us and a couple that we went with.Food was on point, no complaints. Steaks perfect, salads perfect, sides perfect.Where they fell short was in the wait staff.    Usually we get the same waitress, or someone we know like Margie, we should have asked for her, our bad.   We got someone else this time, I will not publicly say who it was , we aired our grievances last night with the manager and I hope they do something about it, like additional training.This in no way will deter us from not coming back, however we will consider one of the other 4 steak joints in Pittsburgh first.  Hyde Park, Ruth Chris, Eddie Merlot, Mortons."
"2.0","Bartender is fantastic and gets 5 stars.  Food has gone a little down hill,, but what is more problematic is that there are dogs everywhere.  Waitresses playing with dogs allowing them to lick their hands and then  Immediately coming back out the door with patrons food.  I understand that people love dogs, but I don't want to sit and eat around them shaking off and diving for scraps. They need to have separate section.  3rd time here this year, first ywo times my food was not good, the third time food was okay, but dogs everywhere.  Not sure I will return"
"4.0","Came here on Thursday night after 9 pm for their half off grilled cheese. It is such a good deal! My friends had the cheesy caprese, while I had the mac attack. The mac attack was amazing. Their mac and cheese is creamy and delicious. The bacon lardons are pockets of crunchy, meaty, goodness. It was delicious! The chips were nothing special. Mine were kind of burnt. Their tomato soup is nice for dunking the ends of the sandwich. My friends loved their caprese sandwich as well. Overall, an excellent option to satisfy any grilled cheese craving."

"5.0","Edward, the host and my waiter, was quite charming and attentive. He was able to make wonderful recommendations, has impeccable timing and manners, and ask while flying seemlessly and effortlessly to all of his appointed tables (all this while hosting simultaneously! ).        At Edwards recommendation I started off with the gouda and also some red mussels, followed  by a house salad with very excellent balsamic dressing, and the crab cakes.      The chef  (Mike I believe the waiter said his name was) and his kitchen help have left nothing to chance.      The gouda was inexplicably delicious, while not being too filling. The red mussels are to die for, especially the exorbitant sauce.       The crab cakes, served on a bed of risotto, we're without a doubt the absolute best (more crab than cake with the risotto cooked to perfection.        The fresh cheese cake, served with fresh strawberries, blue berries and a caramel reduction, was an absolutely wonderful way to end the meal.      If I had any complaint, it was that the portion sizes were a bit large. However, they make for an excellent selling point for any date night.     All in all the quaint, intimate atmosphere, combined with the delectable apps, entrees, and desserts; and of course the fabulous service....makes this a must for all serious and nonchalant foodies or casual diners alike.PS I would definitely make reservations Thursday through Saturday, and request to be seated on Edwards section.  He was phenomenal!!!!"

"2.0","Eh. This place is definitely not a destination for me when I go downtown and we only stop in when ... actually, I have no clue why we stop in. Maybe because we don't do Olive or Twist anymore?Anyway, the beer selection is ok, the bartenders I had last time were awesome, and the decor is odd. It's so sparse, I feel like something's missing. Like, the walls need 'something.' It's hard to explain.I have not eaten here and don't really have a desire to so I'll leave food reviews for others. I guess if everywhere else is packed, try here?"
"4.0","I am glad that we made a reservation during lunch for Restaurant Week, because it certainly seemed very busy when we walked in. Most likely they were catering to the usual customer base of downtown employees in addition to those like us. The interior itself felt like a museum with all the paintings on the walls and the stuffed animal heads (the latter was probably not necessary). One annoying thing was the slow speed at which we were attended to--we had to wait quite a bit before getting our waters, before getting our orders taken, the bread coming out, and then finally each of the fixed courses. The bread and clam chowder first course were fine--pretty tasty, nothing to write home about. The second course got interesting. We each ordered a dry aged sirloin, which came with a good salad on the side. The steak was actually done wonderfully, super tender and finely spiced around. But the problem was that both of ours came out rare when we ordered medium-rare! Even our waiter acknowledged this, although by the time he came back around we waited so long that we were pretty much finished with our meal. It wasn't the biggest problem in the world, but our waiter acknowledged the mixup and compensated our meal. So that was nice, and the desserts were good too. So while I probably wouldn't go back on a normal occasion, it sure was an interesting experience."
"5.0","1000/10. Would always go again. I got the Morning After special with a side of wheat toast and a hot chocolate. The crepe pancakes are amazing, their wheat toast is huge, they know how to make eggs and keep them warm, the bacon is delicious and very flavorful, and the whipped topping on the hot cocoa was abundant and tasted natural. Service was fast (got my food in less than 5 minutes) and very friendly too."
"5.0","Yes, it's a chain. But man, is it incredible! The amazing Jonathan D. took me to TCG for a birthday lunch today where I enjoyed their combo lunch of Butternut Squash Bisque, Lobster Roll and Parmesan/Truffle Fries. He had the Wagyu Mushroom burger and seemed very pleased with it. For ~$20/each it truly doesn't get any better. In addition, the pre-meal bread was so fresh out of the oven, it was actually too hot to touch. Our server Tina noticed that I opened a gift before the meal, assumed it was my birthday, and provided us with dessert afterwards. What service!!! True - it isn't for everyday meals, but I say a special occasion can be a random Tuesday, so treat yourself!"
"4.0","Cute little BYOB Lebanese place on Carson Street.  I love the exposed brick and stark wood tables.  The food is great.  Wild Rice appetizer is so richly flavorful that it's hard to believe it's meatless.  The hummus is smooth and creamy, and the lamb shank falls off the bone."
"5.0","I went there two times while going to Ohio from NJ and back to NJ. Their food was really tasty and fresh. Employees were very polite and well mannered. They served food on time. At the end they served complimentary tea. Five star for them"
"5.0","Great every time! I am sad the tapas display case is gone from the front, but the food is still delicious! I always get the Spanish cider from the cool hand statue to start. The service is friendly, knowledgeable and timely. Always an enjoyable experience!"
"1.0","We used to go there all the time then we went there Saturday. Very disappointing the salad took over 45 minutes  no wings everything is hot and the service sucked the waiter didn't know what went with what he had to keep asking others...very disappointed and we won't be back Jerome  needs to check on this business it's going down."
"2.0","Every time I visit Pittsburgh I come here for bubble tea and it usually tastes pretty good but this time I tried the almond milk tea and I have literally never tasted bubble tea this bad. The almond milk was sour and had chunks in it. I normally get almond milk tea at other bubble tea places so I know that's not what it's supposed to taste like. I went back after I took a sip to ask if the milk went bad and they said they make the milk fresh every morning. I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 because the workers were really nice and friendly."
"5.0","Great place and fresh food! Especially if you want a light lunch like soup and maybe a sandwich. Otherwise definitely try out the mac and cheese!"
"5.0","I loved this place. Great food, especially those wonderful spaetzle-type dumplings, good wine, friendly service, and a nice old-Pittsburgh vibe. The creamed onion soup is a show-stopper."
"3.0","This place had opened awhile back, and I've wanted to try it because the menu looked really good. I had been to the store side a couple times. It's expensive but convenient and for the size, good variety. There was a private event happening so only the front of the restaurant was available. Glasses of wine are $4 all day so I ordered a moscato. The glass is really small, I wish I would've taken a picture. Whatever, I didn't come here for the wine; I came for the food. I ordered garlic Parmesan wings and the spinach dip. The wings were more like 'wing dings' and not worth the $7 simply for their size. I will say that they were flavorful and crispy. The spinach dip on the other hand was just not good at all. It was super thin and I continually added salt to help the flavor. I'm curious to see the back of the restaurant so I may venture back and try something different on the menu. Also, the speciality drink menu looked amazing."
"4.0","We had the pork and veggie bao buns and the shoyu chicken ramen and flaming beef brisket ramen with a butter bomb. The broth was rich and the meats were very good. Surprised to see this place only has 3.5 stars."
"5.0","With NACL closed, this would be a close second of choice. Great flavors and great ambience. Came here late with friends one night for drinks and food. We ordered the wings, chicken liver mousse and carrots as starters. The wings were crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, just the way I like them. Definitely come with friends and order the tagliatelle pasta, crispy skin chicken breast & leg, bavette steak, and agnolotti."
"5.0","The food is absolutely delicious. I went here probably 4+ times and would love to go again. You definitely cannot go wrong with trying this place out!"
"5.0","The food here is so delicious and would like to recommend if someone is coming to Pennsylvania!"
"5.0","This is my third time at Buca and I thoroughly enjoyed my visit. I'm always impressed by the quality customer service here -- shoutout to my table's server Jason for being exceptionally efficient, quick, funny and friendly.[Food]Man, oh man, do they have good food. If you're into carbs and cheese, this is the place for you! The portions here are ridiculous! Even with a football team of people, finishing one plate of food is a real struggle. Don't worry, though, to-go containers are available! I personally really like the Spicy Chicken Pasta. The free bread is super yummy too. Garlicky! Comes with seasoned oil too.[Service]Best service everrr! For real, these people work hard! They deserve every penny and more. Not only do they have the challenge of tailoring to big parties but they have to load heavy plates and split checks a crazy number of times too.[Overall Experience]This is the place to be! Great place for hangouts and parties. Family and friends are bound to have a great time. Birthdays are fun because they have a birthday song just for youuuu!"
"4.0","I always go for the fresh springs rolls with pork and the Saigon soup. You can't go wrong!"
"2.0","I ordered a italian hoagie.. finally because it took forever to place my order ( not even busy).. i ordered it 'hot' an i got microwaved meat on a cold bun....probably not the best or even good... Kinda sad about it because i heard great things...."
"1.0","The fakest Italian food there is. The marinara was lumpy and bland. The service was pathetic. Yea it's family style and if you have no taste buds then it's the place to take your family. Prosciutto stuffed chicken is the only reason it gets 1 star everything else was absolutely horrible. If you call yourself Italian food then you should Atleast be able to make spaghetti properly. Finally the most appealing to was how dirty this establishment was, clean your restaurant"
"4.0","Cafe Cravings is an awesome local gem. I've lived in the Duquesne Heights area of Mt. Washington for 6 years now and Cafe Cravings is one of my favorite parts of the neighborhood. I have been here more times than I can remember and have tried numerous sandwiches and drinks, and I can say that they are consistently good. I love that they have abundant specialty coffee drinks and non-caffeinated drinks that change with the seasons. My favorite for the winter is the Cinnamon Sticky Bun Latte. If you are someone who likes sweets, this latte is delicious! I get it with an extra shot of espresso for some more caffeine and to cut down on the super sweetness.If you're there for breakfast, I really recommend ordering your sandwich on a bagel or croissant. That little detail makes the sandwich so much better! I always enjoy the turkey club for lunch. I love how they give you a side of fruit (usually oranges) with whatever you order!One thing to note - if you are on any kind of a schedule, definitely call ahead if you remember. I have waited almost 40 minutes on some days, which is really crazy for a simple sandwich. However, I will continue to go back because I truly do love the food - you can tell it's prepared with care using quality ingredients. I also love that it's such a great local spot. It's a vital cornerstone of a thriving community!"
"3.0","Food from Buffet was good with variety. But the food was not hot, and some was slightly cold. the lady at the counter working was very rude. She was unfriendly, which mostly ruined the experience for us."
"1.0","Over priced sandwiches and the one lady working stated that she would put a $100 saying the Trump will be shot before his term is up. Very inappropriate talk for a restaurant that was full of customers."
"5.0","Had my first pierogi here today. Very tasty!  Chicken florentine soup extremely good. Now going to dive into this Barbecue Chicken Pizza."
"1.0","I just got back from qdoba in the south side. It was a terrible experience.  I received buy one get one entree coupons, so I've been using them on fridays with a co worker. Today I went (another friday) with my gf and used the coupon, but the cashier said I can't use it on discount days that they have, even though I've used them three times already on fridays.  The cashier was the same one that let me use them the other times too and no where on the coupon does it say anything about what she stated. I was frustrated, but paid full price for both meals.  She was really unpleasant and not accommodating. Then for some reason they threw away my gf's quesadilla, so they had to make another one. When she got the new one it was all slop and had no veggies on it that she requested.  They all fell off on the grill. I will not be coming back to this establishment ever again unless they get new staff and honor their coupons."
"5.0","I will certainly be back.  I ordered the Lamb Curry, which was excellent.  Although not advertised as a spicy dish, it had plenty of kick to it (a perfect amount for me), so be careful ordering something hotter. I also had one of their samosas, which were also good.  Service was fine as well, the waiter gave some good recommendations on what to order."
"4.0","I'm giving Wheelhouse four stars because of the lingering cigarette smoke from the casino. Nothing can be done to get rid of it.Besides that, we went at 4pm on Saturday for a drink and apps. No drink menu so you have to ask and guess what you'd like. Service was quick, accommodating and friendly.I got pierogi nachos(pierogis in cheese sauce, tomatoes, red onion, sour cream and chives). The wine served came filled to the brim. For the sports fan, there are tvs EVERYWHERE!"
"5.0","Unbelievably delicious Turkey sandwich.  Great service. Love this place. James and all the staff were so nice!!"
"4.0","This first visit was very enjoyable...great food and didn't feel rushed at all, waiter was knowledgable and pleasant.  I like the simple one page menu and that they use good quality ingredients, starting with the white bean/balsamic spread, fresh baked bread & house salads.  We had the smoked gouda appetizer recommended by our waiter - delicious!  and wild mushroom bisque - just good. Her pork chop entree was fantastic, best I ever tasted...my shrimp pasta entree was good; cooked perfect but under seasoned.  Definately worth a repeat visit to explore other menu items.  Good job to everyone!"
"4.0","Great place to go on a Saturday or Sunday morning after drinking way too much. The hotcakes are unbelievable but I am a really big fan of their home fries. I also really like their corned beef hash. I'll usually get some sort of omelette and pair it with a hotcake (usually chocolate but blueberry is pretty good too). I'll then make sure there is plenty of home fries and get a side of the corned beef hash. This usually puts me in a food coma but makes me feel fantastic especially after waking up a little hungover or still drunk from the night before.Oh. you have to pay with cash. And this location is also pretty packed so there is usually a line up outside. But it's so worth it."
"5.0","Great venue. I had the mixed platter with hummus falafel babe ghanoush etc and it was solid. Cookies are pretty good too"
"4.0","Went here on a Thursday to celebrate our anniversary and we were one of only three occupied tables. The food was delicious. We tried the homemade mozzarella as an appetizer - it met our expectations and the the bread was amazing. We ordered a $39 bottle of wine and were disappointed when it was delivered with a $12.99 price tag sticker still on it!  Boo. I had the duck breast and it was one of the best I've ever had in Pittsburgh.Nutella mousse as a dessert and French pressed coffee were a fantastic finish to the meal."
"5.0","I almost don't want to keep this to myself, but...La Gourmandine is downtown! Read that with a Kermit flailing arms voice, because I am *that* excited about it.  I do like a certain other regional chain bakery with the French name just fine too, but nothing beats the realer deal, La Gourmandine. It's located just across from the PNC Tower and is stacked with all my delicious familiar favorites that I usually get in the Lawrenceville location, but with the key difference that it's spacious and has seating for dining in. Which I haven't done yet, but will strongly consider for lunch in the future.  For now, I use La Gourmandine as motivation to get out of bed on cold mornings and come downtown instead of working from home in my pjs, haha.  I used to get my once-in-awhile-treat of almond croissants from the Gaby & Jules counter in Market Street Grocery, but even though they are closer to my office, I will be getting them from here because the former can't be bothered to deliver their baked goodies downtown before 8:30 am. The staff is very friendly and fast and is great about explaining what each pastry is, and is quick to tell you what to get in the morning before it sells out for the day."
"5.0","In the area on a business trip and decided to try Kiku based solely on the good Yelp reviews. Did not disappoint. It took a while to find it inside the shopping center, but definitely worth the effort! Stepping into the restaurant from the shopping center was surreal--in a good way. Quaint, welcoming and minimalist in decor--also in a good way. Service was excellent as was the food. My colleague had seared tuna with a green salad, and I had three maki rolls. Wonderful!"
"5.0","Been coming to this lunch buffet any weekend I have the opportunity to,  they are by far the best Indian buffet I've tried in Pittsburgh. Their Tandoori chicken has a nice punch to it,  and is much more flavorful and tender than many in the city. The attention to quality is definitely noticeable throughout their dishes."
"3.0","Really not a great visit last time.  If it had been my first time, I'd never go back.The service was okay.  Our server left in the middle of things without telling us, and while the bartender took over without issue, if I'd known who was taking care of us some of the other issues might have been addressed.I was really sad to see the fried cauliflower not on the menu anymore.  Hopefully it was a sourcing issue and word is it might be coming back, but still a huge disappointment.I ordered an appetizer of fried pig ears and normally they melt in your mouth.  This  time they were barely edible.  I figured if I dumped them in my ramen that they'd soften up enough, but it didn't help, and I could  no longer send them back since they were now in my food.The ramen iself...I got the coconut curry flavour to try something different.  The broth is amazing.  The broth with anything else (noodles, egg, etc) is forgettable.  It's such a delicate, subtle flavour that it's entirely overpowered by any single other ingredient.  The result was ramen that was amazingly bland.The portions were great, as always.  The setting was perfect.  The drinks were good.I just feel like Ki Ramen is slowly succumbing to corner cutting.  Not sure if I can justify dropping seventy dollars on okay ramen."
"5.0","Amazing service! I ordered on DoorDash and my food was delivered promptly. Everything was hot and tasty. Suzan even included sauce I asked for on the side which is often overlooked when using doordash. Will order again and recommend to friends!"
"4.0","As I usually make a weekly trip to Pittsburgh, I am always on the look out for somewhere new to eat. This is always on my list of options. I absolutely love their 'Salads By You'. All the toppings you want for one price (minus some extras). The ingredients are always fresh and the staff is always happy and willing to help you if you have any questions or concerns. The burgers are ok, nothing special (just your typical E'nP burger). Though, I really do enjoy the Mean Gran Avocado Turkey Burger. There's just something about the turkey burger, brioche bun, avocado and swiss cheese that do it for me.Service is usually good, even during the lunch rush. They are usually pleasant and willing to help you with anything you need."
"4.0","With the arrival of Freshii, I was finally able to expand my lunch horizon in Downtown.  Located on Grant, the place screams healthy as you walk in.  There's plenty of seats at the back of the house.  You can pick up juice, order salad, or do what I do and get their noodle soup!  Their Thai-inspired soup with lemongrass is lunch portion.  I was expecting a small side order portion at first.  It was filling and delicious!!!  I always welcome a new lunch addition with noodle option here."
"4.0","Met-up there with friends visiting from out-of-town & had a good time.  The atmosphere is 'industrial' so casual is the dress code.  We took advantage of some of the Happy Hour specials on drinks 'bar food'.  I think the Shrimp Cocktail was one of those specials & it was quite good.There were several large shrimp that were served with lemon wedges & very tasty cocktail sauce.  Having eaten a large (for me) lunch that day, a full main course wasn't the way to go, so I ordered another appetizer - fish tacos (I think they were tilapia) which were also very good.  The beer was as cold as any I can recall, which was really great on a hot/humid summer evening.  My guests were also very pleased, ordering sushi & a whole lobster, respectively.  The service throughout the time was fine, on a somewhat quiet Wednesday evening. I did make a reservation using a system called 'Open Table' as I didn't know in advance how busy it might have been.  As it happened, the reservation wasn't necessary.  Afterward, Open Table sent me a few follow-ups for me to rate everything, which I ignored; that was the only slight negative to the visit.  Parking on the street was free since we began at 6:00pm, so no problem there.  An all-around good experience."
"3.0","Average food and not very timely service during lunchtime. I understand they want to serve fresh food, but during lunch, most people are in a little bit of a hurry."
"4.0","I liked to hide here between classes @ Pitt.PROS:Free WiFi;Great food;Great pastries;nice staff;cleanCONS:  CRAZY busy between 11:30 and 1pm (lunch rush is nuts here!)Parking  (either street on Forbes or surrounding or the Sennott Square garage underneath the building, but the garage is busy after 9:30am)As for the 'takes reservations' question, they have a room that you can rent out for meetings and anything--but that's the only reservations they take.Phone/Fax Order are a 'can do' here."
"4.0","The food is incredible. I ordered garlic naan, a mango lassi, and lamb vindaloo--the best I have ever had. Staff were concerned when I asked for the vindaloo to be prepared extra spicy, but after a little well-intentioned debate she acquiesced to my request. I was incredibly satisfied. The flavors and spiciness were in perfect balance. Few of the Indian restaurants I have frequented are bold enough to meet my capsaicin requests. However, I am confident that anyone even after a little finagling could find the perfect balance of spice to suite their palate.The staff do seem to be a tad confused however. The garlic naan I ordered, which I had asked to be served as an appetizer appeared after my vindaloo, and only after I had asked about it. The food served to my friends had already arrived. Nonetheless, if the communication among the staff were improved, this would be a 5-star establishment!"
"5.0","The first time I was there, had a Shrimp Korma and it was awesome. Honestly much better than any of the dishes I had  at Prince of India near by, and for $5.50 you get a large portion, actually had plenty of shrimp and spicy enough.(I asked for 9/10 so probably for 9 I did want it to be spicier)The place has enough options, including vegetarian and shrimp options.If I had to complain, the rice looked a little weird, and I don't really like the curry served all over the rice, but again for a food truck its understandable. Also it did take time.Overall I will definitely go there again, and pretty regularly at that too."
"3.0","Fazio's has a secret: their Sicilian squares are pretty decent--one of the closest squares I could find comparable to Brooklyn square, which is hard to find in the east end. their normal pie is ok but the Sicilian is leagues better. 2 cuts will only set you back about $5, a great deal."
"2.0","The ambiance here is horrible, but the food was decent.  Although the restaurant was sparkling clean, it didn't smell great (I suspect it was some sulphur-based cleaner vs a sewage problem).  This place has been here forever and it shows - the decor is extremely dated - from the unflattering flat florescent lighting to the old-school message letter sign board menu above the counter.  Not a great look for a Market Square eatery in what has become such a trendy area where competitors offer tastier, fancier fare around the same price.The food was okay - I got some fresh, hot, underseasoned scrod (fixable) and some *really* good, fresh coleslaw.  The fish was hiding under a giant piece of lettuce with a tomato slice on top (not sure what was going on there).  Everything was plated like a charity worker plates food for the homeless, but again it was hot, fresh and the seasoning thing was fixable with all the available condiments they have in-house.Big issue is their 'cash only' policy, which they neglected to put on the door for all to see (I checked).  So, after waiting in line once, I get a nasty surprise at the register with my credit card in hand.  Had to go outside to the (conveniently placed) ATM just outside that charges $2 to withdraw and get back in line a second time.  Not a happy experience during a time-sensitive lunch with friends.Judging strictly by the food, this place was okay, good even.  It is just in serious need of some Gordon Ramsay-style upgrades to bring this place into the 21st century either by making it a bona fide vintage eatery or Millenial-grade chic seafood to match the rest of the eateries here.  Right now, it's got that 'old and tired feel' down pat."
"5.0","Real community spot Had the rosemary chickpea soup today- an Italian hot tub for my winter bones! food made with real love and care. Tons of options so everyone feels welcome. Vegan visiting chef on weekends... I'm told.Many vegan options"
"5.0","Healthy food, long line ups but worth the wait. good vibe and everyone is dedicated to healthy eating."
"3.0","I love the atmosphere at Il Tetto. It is a great spot to hang out after work and have a few beers with the co-workers. However, I'm giving il Tetto three stars because of the not so great prices/appetizers and awkward ID process.   A few of my co-workers held a happy hour at Il Tetto for me to celebrate my move to a different department. I was actually running late....I know late to my own happy hour....and as soon as the elevator door opened I hopped off, saw my co-workers waving me over, and proceed to hurry on over. Well, I totally forgot about their awkward ID process. You have to actually hand a 'bouncer' your ID As soon as you get off the elevator. I forgot to do this since I was in a rush to get over to my co-workers. Well, i shouldn't have forgotten.... The 'bouncer' rushes up behind me and touches me on the shoulder to get my attention. This was totally awkward and uncomfortable. I understand it is their process, but maybe he could have let me set my things down and been a bit more relaxed in how he asked for my ID. just a suggestion. Another thing I'm not too crazy about is the menu. They don't have the best beer selection for the prices. I paid almost $6 for one yuengling summer wheat beer. I drank imported German beer for $6 in a bar in NYC (this was a rare find, I know). But, still... $6 for a yuengling and it wasn't even a craft beer. Next, I do not care much for the food options/prices. One of the appetizers was $18!"
"5.0","Definitely one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh! I recommend the white sangria. Our favorite dishes were the octopus and the ribs. The octopus was seared, so it has a meaty texture. And the ribs fell right off the bone. The service (the host, waitress and bussing) were all wonderful too. The atmosphere is great for a date night or a night out with friends."
"2.0","Based on others' reviews here, I got two appetizers (samosas and lamb kebabs) instead of a main course for dinner, and I think I left happier (in terms of value and satiation) because of it, based on what I saw of my dining companions' choices.   I did like what I had, too.I ate once or twice at the former Star of India, and Yuva is much better in terms of decor, and possibly even food (I can't remember the old menu, maybe it is really the same and it could even be the same cook in the kitchen for all I know).Props for the great service - the waitress was willing to split checks for a large party, and the food came out promptly and together, which was impressive.However, we are lucky in Pittsburgh to have other Indian restaurants that are really very good -- like Udipi and the India Gardens.  Yuva isn't even in the same league, which is why I'm giving it only two stars."
"1.0","Ordered Gennaro's for the first time in about 6 months after the last time I had a hair in my pasta. Figured we would give it another try this time through. Ordered everything, driver calls when he gets to my house, and ends up being close to a block from my house. Had to walk well outside of my house to find this guy, as hes calling me back to ask me if I was even coming or not. After finding the driver, he hands me my food, which is an incomplete order.. Called back to a nice girl who apologized & had the rest sent out.. Went back inside to look to find my pizza was also made wrong. Easily never going back to here again after these 2 horrible experiences. Would not recommend at all. Plenty of other pizza shops in the SouthSide.."
"5.0","Love!!  I always get the curries and their amazing!  Always the right spiciness and good ratio of meat/veggies/broth.  Their servings are generous, too!  I like the customer service too...  I always get take out and sometimes they throw in goodies in extra goodies in my bag :)  One of my staples for sure!"
"5.0","We went to cinderland for drinks without knowing that typically people get dinner here. However, although the selection of the beers was not that wide, we felt very happy with the stout and the guest tap that we got!The chocolate mint vanilla double milk stout was pretty great, but I suggest that you share it because the entire beer is heavy and you might end up not enjoying so much of it. Try also the rest of the selection!"
"2.0","Though the ambiance is nice, we were throughly unimpressed with the food and service. I ordered eggs, they were completely cooked through and rubbery. Came with 2 slices of American cheese (yuck)! The other food was okay, but not worth the $40 check for 2. They also charged .50 for tiny water bottles that we had not ordered. Not satisfied, not coming back. Left a lot to be desired."
"3.0","So I came into Doce Taqueria expecting excellent service and there was a blonde here that was here and is super impersonal but the guy cook was super nice and conversation with the customers. The girl was treating the customers like they we weren't important. Vinnie was awesome!"
"4.0","Great coffee shop find from Yelp. Was stuck on the south side for several hours this afternoon, and needed a place to get some work done. This spot was a little out of the way, but worth it for the friendly service, tasty chai latte, and most of all the eminently work-friendly upstairs seating area. It was quiet, comfortable, and not so crowded as to distract. Would definitely go back."
"4.0","Good place for both poke and sushi. The place is very clean and the food is well prepared. Portions are decently sized too. Food is decent as well, but don't expect anything special or unique. Just your typical sushi place. Poke bowls are a good option if you want bigger portions. Well worth your money and time."
"4.0","Out of 5:3.0 - Grilled Strip Steak: Fresh bread and greens.  Steak was a tad overcooked, but still good.3.5 - Farfalle with almonds: Great mix of flavors and textures.2.0 - Service: a bit slow, forgot some details about my order."
"1.0","So I recently saw the movie 'The Founder' about McDonald's pioneer Ray Kroc and instead of coming away inspired and appreciative, I felt sadness over what Kroc's creation has become. And this location is the the perfect example. Deplorable. Typical downtown bs, signs posted everywhere give you an idea of clientele you can expect to come across. No loitering, bathrooms for paying customers only, no refunds without receipt and food, no soda machines in the dining room because you'd have every derelict in there filling up their Dunkin Donuts cups they pulled from the trash. And they're in there too--adolescents just hanging around smashing some poor guy's tablet they must've found somewhere, a homeless man with all his earthly belongings strewn about the floor and table, scantily clad women getting chased literally through the restaurant by exactly who you'd expect. Makes it hard to sit and eat, that's for sure, but entertaining nonetheless. The service, tho, takes the cake. A handful of employees shuffling around turning out the occasional sandwich or fry. If there's a crowd, forget it, you'll be there all day. No attempt to keep the restaurant clean, the fryer alarm beeping for an eternity with employees walking right by it but not bothering to push the single button it takes to silence it. The conversation is always who didn't come in to work and a countdown to when others get to leave of go on break. Service is an inconvenience, clearly. No motivation whatsoever. All for what? A hamburger."
"4.0","The starters/small plates were downright phenomenal--the carrot salad was incredible (creamy, almost tofu-like chickpea fritters!), and the beef tongue was an indulgence in beefy deliciousness perfect for a cold fall evening. While the entrees (chicken and pork) were pretty tasty, they were much less inventive--we're fortunate enough to have a sous vide setup at home and the entrees were things we could fairly easily recreate.Our server wasn't overly friendly but the food runner was incredibly gregarious, chatting with us about the preparation of the food and making additional recommendations. If he's not also a server, Station is not making enough use of his talents! He also talked us into dessert, and the caramel popcorn panna cotta was really tasty. However, the vessel used for serving isn't particularly conducive to experiencing the carefully flavor-balanced layers--the popcorn is so deep in the narrow container that you don't get any panna cotta until the 4th or 5th spoonful. Fortunately, we picked off some of the popcorn so we could enjoy it all the way down. If you're a fan of less sweet, more balanced desserts, I heartily recommend it.Drinks were excellent, and the bartender was happy to make classic cocktails in addition to the interesting libations on the menu. I'd absolutely return for small plates and drinks...and perhaps another panna cotta. It's worth mentioning that this was a Wednesday night around 8pm and while we got a table, they were still nearly full...glad to see they're getting the foot traffic they deserve!"
"1.0","I thought I'd try this place out cause sometimes I don't trust reviewers, but this location is terrible. I got a 3 piece chicken tender fill up and my chicken tenders were so small they seemed non-existent. Total waste of money. The staff was nice and they were prompt to replace my mashed potatoes with ones with no gravy, like I asked for when I first ordered, but what kind of chicken tenders are these? Any other KFC I've been to has given me extra tenders when they're this small so that they actually equate to normal sized tenders. Not here. Definitely not coming here again."
"2.0","I really tried to like this place. But after my second experience there, I can safely say that there will be no return. The appalling attitude and service sealed the deal. For example, the three of us ordered five spring rolls. Ten spring rolls were brought out. The manager begrudgingly returned five of the spring rolls. To avoid confusion again, the entrees were selected by actually pointing at them on the menu. The food arrived. It was woefully adequate. Most bun cha gio have fresh cucumbers , carrots, romaine, and other assorted veggies. Ours had none of that. My girl's pho was good but bland. But the worst part was that the restaurant actually charged us for the more expensive versions of the dishes, even despite our explicit selection. My frustration level prevented me from fighting the charges. So I resentfully paid and vowed never to return.  It is a shame. Pittsburgh's Asian ethnic food scene is very underrepresented in a city this size."
"5.0","My husband and I went to CHiKN on Friday night after I saw an ad on Instagram. We were sold after looking up the menu and reading reviews. CHiKN is a fast-casual type place, where you place your order at the counter (cards only, no cash!), then they bring your tray to your table. The spice level is your choice from 0-4. I got level 1 and my husband got 2. We made one of our meals a combo, which for $3 extra, came with seasoned crinkle-cut fries and a fountain drink. Our food was so yummy! We both ordered tenders (I ordered 3 and my husband 5). The portions were huge. The level 1 chicken was very flavorful with minimal spice. Almost a smoky/sweet heat, as I would describe it. The level 2 tasted quite different with a good level of spice that didn't make our noses run. I think I would get level 2 next time because I enjoyed the spice! The chicken is served with a sauce as well that toned down the spice a bit, but you really didn't need it because of how much flavor is in the tenders!We thoroughly enjoyed our meals and will 100% be back soon!"
"3.0","On a diet and hoping to keep the calorie count low? Look much further--The Yard is not the place for you. The food mostly revolves around different variations of the classic grilled cheese+tomato soup combo. The food was messy and filling but quite salty. This is also not the place if you were hoping to get a good conversation in. The music and surroundings were quite loud when I went. Overall, I would only go again with friends I see often for an indulgent weekend meal."
"5.0","Great food, bar, and location. Will be back. Arugula salad and parmesan risotto were delicious. The staff is very knowledgeable about the food."
"5.0","Delicious breakfast menu in generous portions.  Loved the crepe style hotcakes filled with fresh strawberries or blueberries.   Excellent friendly service."
"4.0","Recommend by several senior student of mine in CMU, finally I came here today for my dear friends birthday. Food in here really amazing and served very fast. Associates in Pamela's also very kind and sweet. But they only receive cash no credit card such a pity.  Love this dinning experience and will come back very soon :D"
"4.0","The lunch buffet doesn't has as much option as all India. The dinner food is pretty good. Good place for southern Indian food."
"5.0","Stopped by here late tonight with a group of friends who suggested it and I was not disappointed at all! I ordered the chicken gyro special which came with a large amount of fries and a soda for only $8! That's a steal in my opinion. They gave me a TON of chicken and it was cooked really well and super flavorful. The tzatziki sauce was delicious and the veggies on top of the gyro were fresh. They give you a whole small to-go box of fries and you HAVE to put the 'fry dust' on it, so delicious! There were about eight of us and all of our orders were all done in probably around 20 minutes, so that's not horrible at all, especially with only one dude working the grill at that time of night. The woman behind the register was super friendly, courteous, and speedy. I would definitely come here again the next time I'm craving gyros. I'm so sad that I forgot to take photos of the food before devouring it but it was just THAT good. Cheap, delicious, and a large portion of food; what more could you ask for?"
"1.0","If I could leave zero stars - I would - this place treats their customers unjustly and I will never return and neither will any of my friends. Way too many other great bars in the city of Pittsburgh to waste your time and money here."
"4.0","Moving to Brighton Heights after living in Squirrel Hill, and Oakland and Monroeville before that, one of the main things I miss is great pizza. We've ordered from a bunch of places around Northside and Bellevue and they have all been super disappointing. The only place we've liked so far has been Wiseguys. The crust is thin and very crispy, even after being refrigerated, and the sauce is plentiful and well-seasoned. The sausage is mild, which I liked (perfect cold breakfast pizza!) but my husband wasn't impressed with it. Great price for the extra-large Don with coupons from the Pennysaver. It can't compare with my Squirrel Hill favorites, but if I want delivery, it will probably be from Wiseguys."
"5.0","Make sure you have cash because you CAN'T MISS THIS AMAZING TACO STAND! We would go back every day if we could. It's our favorite place on the strip to eat.  I always get the 2 chicken tacos with everything on it and add your own salsa in the salsa bar to the side of the stand. There are two picnic style tables to sit at. They also have cheap specials that you can try including empanadas, etc. They're very friendly and sweet. The quality is always consistent. You can smell the deliciousness from blocks away."
"4.0","To start, the food here is five stars. Period. We tried the beef tenderloin, chicken skins, and pork belly from the robotayaki menu and all were delicious. The pork belly literally melted in our mouths. We followed with the tuna, eel, and scallop nigiri. All were absolutely delicious but, as others have mentioned, a bit overpriced for the amount of food (2 pieces instead of 1 would suffice). We moved on to the pork ramen and the miso ramen, both of which were wonderful but the miso ramen is out of this world good. I would have devoured a second bowl. The crispy chili is the key. Fried ice cream dessert was nice as well. Cocktails were nothing special but good (the 33oz Asahi paired better with the meal in my opinion). I knocked off a star for service. A less-than-pleasant hostess informed me upon arrival that our 8:30 reservation wasn't ready yet (it was 8:30 on the dot) and to grab a drink. No big deal. However, we waited nearly 20 minutes for both the table and two drinks to be maid. Before we could even settle the bar tab, we were being whisked to our table late. Our server, who ended up being great, took nearly 20 minutes to bring water and to even ask if we were ready to order. The service may not have annoyed some, but it was a weird way to start what was an otherwise outstanding experience."
"2.0","My parents, sister and I ate here for lunch today. I don't really have any complaints about the food, but the layout of this place is very strange. We were seated on the first floor. To get to the restrooms, you either have to take the stairs (or the elevator) to the second floor and walk through the kitchen. I have never seen that before.I have also noticed the cleanliness standards are lacking in this place. It smells mildewy and that needs to be addressed.I would be willing to give them a second chance and try one of their other locations, but not this one. http://www.yelp.com/biz/buca-di-beppo-italian-restaurant-pittsburgh"
"5.0","Great sandwiches! They are located on Liberty Avenue across the street from Fifth Avenue Place.They offer three types of different sandwiches. Plain Slims which is a regular sub minus the veggies. Eight inch sub sandwiches and Giant Club Sandwiches which have twice the meat and cheese. You can choose between two types of bread (french and seven grain). You can also get a low carb lettuce wrap called a JJ Unwich if your watching your calories.If your really hungry or just want to have your own 'Man vs Food' moment go for The JJ Gargantuan. It consists of genoa salami, sliced smoked ham, capicola, roast beef, turkey and provolone cheese on a french bun smothered with onions, mayo, lettuce and tomato covered with homemade Italian dressing. It is utterly amazing! I think I have a tear in my eye."
"1.0","First time visiting Pittsburgh in love with the city . Decided to visit this bar in my birthday and the worst customer service. First i went to the rooftop and after 10 min order my drink they close down the bar at 10:45pm . Still i wanted to stay went downstair to finish my drink and order more with our friends. Few people at the bar nice music. Request drinks and the bartenders for drinks and said i would be there in a sec . Call her attention saying in a polite way and the reply was always I would be there in a sec. Still has been 2 hours and yet no one has come to serve us .Hope that the two young ladies serving the bar learn to have good manners and have the best customer service."
"5.0","It was great... one of the best tapas I have ever tried. Raw fish with pomegranate was such a brilliant idea. Cherry jam with chicken liver is balanced!! Ham was typical Spanish one and whole fish with lemon is tender in texture and the fish skin is crispy."
"4.0","This place is a hidden gem. It's been getting more attention lately and for good reason. The beer list is very good and the food is really good, plus the kitchen is open until 1. The atmosphere is casual and there is a great little lounge section in the back. This is a great place to go for a chill weekend or week night."
"5.0","My most recent visit here was to celebrate V Day. I was given a choice of my favorite restaurant and this is it.Reservations were made for 8pm and we were seated in a good spot to catch action on the TV while we talked and ate. Our server was the same gal that served for my bday party. Her name slips my mind but she's really sweet. She ran through the specials and then left us to decide. I chose the baja shrimp and day boat scallops which is served with rice, asparagus and choice of sauce. I chose the lobster buerre crack, ummm I mean blanc. Lol it's very good.  The scallops and shrimp were cooked perfectly!!! The rice was a great accompaniment and the asparagus had a yummy char on it.  My valentine had the stuffed salmon. He really enjoyed his meal as well as 1 of the shrimp I was willing to part with. Unlike the seafood chains, the food is seasoned well here and not overly salted. The meals are very filling so there wasn't room for dessert but whatever dessert they were flaming by the bar looked really good.I've been to many seafood restaurants around here as well as ocean front spots and this place is above average. From the apps to the sushi to the entrees....you can't go wrong with the fresh fish and creativity that's served up here."
"5.0","Got to try this restaurant courtesy of Uber eats app. I ordered a BBQ hot dog, The cheesesteak and loaded fries. First thing I inhaled was the Hot dog.  The flavor from how it was cooked was so good i didnt want to put it down. Second thing i tried was half of the cheesesteak. It was tender, juicy and the bread choice was perfect. Last, i tried some of the loaded fries. I wish i had ordered more cheese but the taste was fantastic."
"5.0","What a fabulous coffee shop that hosted a wonderful Yelp event.  The coffees were delicious (espically when there was just a dash o Bally's in my latte) and several beers for my friends.The decor is perfect.  Places like this make me want to move to the Southside.  Great coffee, great bars, friendly staff!"
"3.0","Average tasting pizza, nothing different or particularly delicious. The dough is very thin and doesn't have a whole bunch of flavor. Sauce is thinly put on and has a slight sweet flavor. We ordered pepperoni and sausage, which they did put a good amount of on top. They also put a good amount of cheese on the pizza. Their pizzas are pretty expensive for the quality and in comparison to other pizza restaurnts. We paid $24 for our large. If you're looking for pizza, it's a convenient and decent, just nothing overly amazing."
"5.0","After getting gift cards for Luke Wholey's for Christmas, my boyfriend and I decided to save them for when the weather is nicer. Finally, the time has come that we've gotten nice, enjoyable weather and we decided to cash in on our gift cards. It's ok to go here when the weather is not so favorable, but I love feeling the breeze flow through a restaurant while eating, and it's nice to have the option to sit outside!We split the crab cake appetizer (2 small crab cakes), and it was the perfect portion size for the two of us. The sauce that came with it for dipping was their Cajun aioli, and let me tell you as the self-proclaimed Condiment Queen that this is one of my favorite house-made sauces that I've tasted. I ordered the blackened ahi tuna sandwich cooked rare, the only respectable way to eat blackened ahi tuna. The sandwich came with the Cajun aioli and a generous portion of well-seasoned fries. Ahi tuna has a wonderful, fresh yet almost steak-like feel to it. Cooking it too long causes it to dry out and lose some of the lovely flavor and moisture it naturally has. It was grilled to perfection for the short time that it was on the grill, and that deep reddish color in the middle was mouth-watering.My boyfriend got the Steel City Lobster Roll. He loves getting things that I don't cook at home when we go out, and I most certainly don't cook lobster at home. His sandwich came with huge, beautiful buttery chunks of lobster on it, and there was a good amount of Luke Wholey's lobster bisque on top. It was a work of art. If you don't like lobster, this sandwich may just convert you. When the waiter brought us our food he told us the restaurant was very proud of the Steel City Lobster Roll, and it isn't hard to tell why! Personally, lobster isn't my absolute favorite seafood as it can be a little sweet for my liking, but the lobster bisque balanced it out well. My boyfriend asked for a cup of the Cajun aioli on the side, and it was just as tasty on my sandwich as it was on the fries!Overall, I felt like the pricing was fair at Luke Wholey's for the freshness of the food and the portion size. Fresh seafood can get pricey, and if you view the menu you will notice a slight jump in prices between lunch and dinner. The portion size and dishes differ at dinner, but since I was here for lunch our bill for 2 sandwiches and an appetizer was a fair $45. Trying one of Luke Wholey's Bloody Marys and some sushi is on my list for next time. The service was friendly and quick, prices were okay, and the food was fantastic. I can't really think of anything that would've made our experience better, so we will definitely be looking forward to our next visit. Definitely worth stopping here if you're in the Strip!"
"2.0","First of all I'm a STEELER FAN but when it comes to food that's a different story.The buffalo spicy wings were ok, quite dry. The side of fries had just a hand full on a large plate and the 12oz rib eye steak had no favor when I added salt the shakers were wet so there was no salt that came out.The bathroom had no toilet paper in 4 stalls and there were no napkins.1 star for personable customer service and another star because it's a STEELER restaurant."
"5.0","When your down the strip on a Saturday or Sunday you gotta experience the Bloody Mary they serve , shrimp bacon or a soft shell crab , it is awesome The lobster roll was fantastic with lobster bisque on it also"
"4.0","This place has been really good both times I have been there. The hummus is fantastic and the lamb is amazing. The salads and grape leaves were also crisp and delicious. It's a BYOB so we of course had wine with us.. The service is acceptable and the price isn't too bad."
"4.0","You can always expect great prices and quality food here! Very clean and well kept up with which is huge. Staff is also very friendly and inviting always making me want to come back. Overall great place to go watch your favorite sports team and get some great wings"
"2.0","I normally do not write bad reviews, but am motivated by the obviously fake reviews here that are glowing, and from out of town accounts with one review.The place is a disorganized mess. Not very busy but everything slow slow and chaotic. The only staff were a few young people, likely the owner's kids, who appear to have never before worked in a restaurant. Maybe never been in a restaurant. The food was bland and generic, think low end food court; there might not be a 'chef' other than a microwave and can opener. One of us got sushi, and to address the fake reviews- it was not actually sushi but was made with some sort of fish paste.  I really wanted to have good asian in Shadyside, this isn't it"
"5.0","Way more than a pizza place!  This place is on the 2nd floor of Sienna Mercato.  You have to check it out. Take the steps up right from the main entrance and you will come right into this place. They have awesome bar seating and a great dining room overlooking Penn Ave. Their pizza is unreal, but their gnocchi is all homemade and very unique. They offer small, medium and large plates and all are great for sharing. Pizza is a must try here, but sample a little of everything!  Their desserts are also great. Definitely worth a stop here. There is a parking lot right across the street and you can walk to any of the theaters from this place as well. Good location and great food."
"4.0","I have been to Girasole 3 times now, once in June, August and today. Here are my thoughts over all three of my visits.The atmosphere is inherently romantic, except that the popularity of the restaurant combined with the small space makes it difficult for it to be an intimate outing on a weekend (I've been there on Friday and Sunday evenings for dinner, not sure the situation on weekdays). Sometimes it can get pretty loud.However, the food makes up for what lacks in terms of atmosphere. I love that they give unlimited table bread with your choice of butter, olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Their entrees come with a house salad that is exquisite: sometimes I look forward to it more than the pasta! It has this great tart dressing with gorgonzola cheese and roasted pine nuts. Absolutely divine.I've tried three entrees:1) Cavatelli with lamb sausage - light sauce, very flavorful meatballs. Loved trying a new pasta2) Penne with grilled chicken - a constant on an otherwise seasonal menu; this is my BF's staple order but was a bit too safe for me3) The famous cheese and spinach ravioli in a tomato cream sauce - THE BEST RAVIOLI I've ever had. Dipped the bread in the extra sauce, this will definitely be my order moving forward!"
"5.0","Stumbled upon this place while walking to go somewhere else for lunch. Decided to go here instead. WOW! What a little tucked away gem. My coworkers and I loved it so much, we came back a second day in a row. I've gotten the burrito, which was HUGE. I couldn't finish it all. It was packed with rice and beans, onion, peppers, beef and everything in between. I also tried the beef empanada which was clearly very homemade and good!! We also shared chips queso/guac. Queso is so creamy and jalapeño and guac was very flavorful!The second day I got the mole enchiladas and street corn. SO GOOD. Flavorful and satisfying. You can taste all the elements of the mole. And the street corn was sweet and creamy and a little spicy. I can't wait to literally try everything on their menu. Not only does this place have great food, it's run by Edgar (I am assuming) and two other ladies. They are always so sweet and nice! Can't wait to tell everyone about this place and to go back!"
"4.0","I hate going to Oakland, but I've been finding great little gems, and this place is one of them. The restaurant is in what looks like an old home. The area that's converted into the dining space isn't very large, but it's cozy. We were seated promptly and given water and menus. The waiter never asked if we wanted anything else to drink but water sufficed. The menu has plenty of choices without being overwhelming and there is something for everyone. We had plenty of time to look it over, actually a little too much time, it took a while to snag someone's attention to take our orders. Our food came in a decent time and was a good portion. I ordered chicken korma, it was mild and probably a new favorite dish! I loved the flavors. My boyfriend ordered the chilly chicken and said it was incredibly spicy but he was equally as satisfied with his choice. We will absolutely be back for another meal soon!"
"3.0","You kind of get what you pay for here. It's your basic food at a basic price. I particularly like the salad bar over everything. The burgers are good as are the chicken dishes. Superburger combo for 7.99 or the Angusburger special for 10.99. Grab a piece of pie for 2.99 as of this review."
"1.0","Not sure how this establishment received more than one star. I ordered pork fried rice, wonton soup and an egg roll. The rice was extremely dry, as if zero soy sauce was used to prepare this in a wok and they just decided to use frozen rice and a microwave at half strength. The wonton soup tasted as though it had sat around for hours. The noodles were extremely soft even though I ordered upon arrival. Lastly, the egg roll was burnt. How do you burn an egg roll? Nothing but incompetence."
"4.0","Ambiance:  Modern gastropub with a neighborhood feel.  Located in a basement just off of walnut street.  Bar area with numerous TV's on the right and separate dinning area to the left with some TVs.Food: Wide variety of fairly standard gastropub type food including burgers, wings, a wide variety of apps, salads, etc...  Of note, they do have about 25 gourmet grilled cheese offerings which are paired with a cup of tomato soup and french fries.  I've tried 3-4 of them and all have been pretty good.  Also recommended are the flatbreads, particularly the imperial swine.Drinks: About 40 beers on top with options of 12, 16, or 32 ounce as well as mix-and-match flights.  Pretty good selection of regional and national craft brews.  A few hard to find beers make it in here from time to time, though not as 'beer nerdy' of a selection as Caliente's or Sharp Edge.  Also with a full bar including some craft cocktails and a decent wine selection, though I usually stick to beer here.Service: Always have had attentive, knowledgeable service.Tips/Extras: Not the best cell phone service as it is in the basement.  Trivia is on Wednesday's.  Good daily specials on food and drinks.Overall: A great place to stop for food or drinks.  The only thing that stopped me from giving 5 stars is that while everything here is done well, nothing really stands out as amazing."
"5.0","My girlfriend and I went there last night, it was a Monday and everything was fabulous. We stopped by the bar for a glass of wine before going to a table. Our server was very nice and the manager stopped by to check on us at one point as well. The food was also delicious! Big hearty portions of Italian food. We recommend!"
"2.0","It's so sad what's happened to The Yard. I used to enjoy coming here, but it's taken a sharp turn down.  I've been twice in the past week and each time it's taken about 35-50 minutes to receive food after ordering. After the first time, I assumed they were having a rough day, but on the 2nd time, I realized it's because their kitchen is swamped by Uber eats or Grubhub orders and can't turn out food for the restaurant. We were also seated on the bar side for one of the meals and while the bartender was nice, she was left to cover the entire side by herself. At one point 3 servers and the hostess were joking around at the bar, while we were unsuccessfully trying to get our check. Sadly, I don't expect we'll be back."
"5.0","This is by far the BEST lobster roll I have ever tasted!!! We also ordered the lobster and shrimp pizza... it was AMAZING! They are not stingy at all with their Lobster. MUST TRY!"
"5.0","I had the cabbage & taleggio ravioli & my date had the Bavette steak. Both dishes were exceptional, five stars all day."
"5.0","Oh my god this place has changed my whole view of food. Everything is so amazingly flavorful and it's all vegan. I couldn't get over it. We got the General NGO's tater tots which is a take on chongquing chicken with tater tots!! And then we had the dumplings which is an interesting Eastern European dumpling filled with cabbage and mushrooms but tastes Asian. The headbangers balls - tofu croquets with cilantro chutney and kale with forbidden rice was superb. Everything was uuuhhhmazing! And I'm no vegan. One of the best places to eat in PGH on a street surrounded by dollar general, checks cashed, the conv store and your friendly neighborhood biker metal vegan restaurant. It will blow your mind."
"2.0","My mistake was reading all of the Yelp reviews for Station before I went because my expectation level was high.  I met a friend for an early dinner on a Friday night. It's close to a parking lot (convenient) on Liberty.  We had a reservation and were seated promptly.  The dining areas and bar are smallish, but it was okay and didn't feel cramped.  The decor is cool and trendy. It's a very pleasant space.We were greeted promptly by our server, and they had a nice craft beer and drink selection.  My friend ordered two small plates (the liver mouse and the endive), and I got the Station burger. You know... I just expected more based on the reviews.  Isn't that sad? The mouse was fine but mostly overpowered by the heavily buttered, seasoned, and salted bread.  I didn't try the endive, but it was a bit sad, small, and seemed overpriced.  Maybe it was amazing and I missed out.  My burger was flavorful and good, but again, the bread was heavily buttered, heavily salted, and overpowered the flavors.  Guess what the fries tasted like? Salt.  I'm Southern.  I love butter and salt.  I require salt to prevent hypotension.  But I felt like the food we had relied too much on butter and salt, which is a cheap trick for a moderate-scale restaurant.  I feel bad that I didn't love Station.  My friend loves it.  I wanted to.  I waited to write my review to be sure I'm not being unfair.  Since I was at Station, I've drunk water like its my job.  I just didn't love it. Sadly... I'm sure."
"5.0","it gives off a great vibe of variety with all the different floors! I like going there with friends on the weekend; we can always count on having a good time at marios"
"4.0","Cinderland's is a brand new Brewpub/Brewery that just opened up in Lawrenceville.  My boyfriend and I stumbled upon it during the Lawrenceville cookie tour, and it happened to be their first day open.  The place itself is really cool! They highlighted some of the unique details of the old building they're in and incorporated lots of brick and subway tile, which I loved! The space was huge too, both big parties and small parties alike could easily feel comfortable there.There were only 5 beers on tap, but they seemed to have a good mix of different styles.  My boyfriend ordered the NE IPA and I ordered the Berlinner Weisse.  The Berlinner Weisse had a tart and fruity taste, so if you're a fan of sour beers then I would definitely recommend it!  I didn't try any of the food, but everything on the menu sounded delicious!  I would love to come back with a group of friends and try more!!!"
"5.0","Full disclosure. I adore Stagioni's, but I've never actually eaten in the restaurant. Each time I've been there, I've eaten at the intimate, granite-topped, 4-seater bar as you enter. If you're lucky enough to snag a barstool at said bar, you've hit the jackpot!The bartenders are skilled, friendly and knowledgeable about the both wares behind them and the menu of fine, very approachable Italian cuisine. Trust their recommendations on both food and drink...they know their stuff.Our recent visit started with cocktails...a Salty Italian for me, a classic Gibson for my dining companion. Both were perfection. Being New Year's Eve, instead of a big meal, we made dinner of several appetizers and dessert...and another cocktail each! If you try nothing else at Stagioni's, do NOT miss the Brussels Sprouts Slaw! Shaved, crisp and lacy sprouts, salty pecorino, bits of sweet dates, crunchy toasted hazelnuts and a dressing of browned butter and damned good sherry vinegar was the delight of the night! I easily could have ordered a second heaping bowl for dessert!We also shared tender sweet shrimp atop a bed of crushed, olive oil dressed and seasoned chickpeas and a tart, snappy giardinare of fresh fennel, carrots, onion and radishes. The dishes complemented each other beautifully! To finish the evening, we shared a pistachio semi freddo crowned with a healthy sprinkling of cocoa nibs, nestled in a pool of orange creme...cold and creamy and crunchy...nice ending! Oh, to accompany desert I sipped a classic Manhattan while my companion enjoyed a Smokey Snap...Art In The Age Snap with lemon syrup, a touch of scotch and an orange twist. Yum!I'm sure my experience would have been just as wonderful seated in the cozy dining room...it always looks so warm and inviting from my perch at the bar...but why buck what is tradition by now?!"
"4.0","Came here with a group and ended up ordering the regular size Pho Hanoi along with beef as the dish's meat. Was pleasantly surprised at how flavorful the broth was. It's definitely one of the better tasting pho broths that I've had in pho around Pittsburgh. Noodles were alright, what one would expect in a dish like this. Not too floury, but also not too thin (to the point of falling apart). The pho also came along with a dish of bean sprouts and basil. I mostly used the bean sprouts, which came fresh.In general, I found it to be relatively satisfying. I'll have to come back sometime to try some of their other offerings, but so far a good first impression certainly helps."
"1.0","I had given them three stars because the place had really gone down hill. In fact until tonight I hadn't been there in years. After this experience they're now a one star rating and I'm desperate to give them zero stars. How I wish that were an option.Placed an order for delivery tonight, was told they don't deliver. Hello?!? They're on Grubhub! Ok whatever, told them my boyfriend would pick it up. We're told 20 minutes. He gets there and no one greets him or assists him. He tries to get help only to be ignored. I called the restaurant FIVE times to tell them he was standing there waiting for service. I'm lied to and told they've talked to him and our food is being taken to him. An hour later he's still there (order was placed online and my card was already charged $55). He gets home with the food (we live five minutes away by car). Our three orders of dol are missing as is an order of samosas and naan. There's a weird dish we didn't order that looked like crushed bugs. The one order of naan we did get had a baby roach in the packaging (see photo). Tried calling them back for thirty minutes to complain and get a refund. I'm calling again as soon as they open and I better get my money back. I just can't believe this even happened. We had to throw away all of the food because of the roach. I'm so sick over this. Please do yourselves a favor and stay away!!"
"2.0","We were the only people in the restaurant, but still had a 45 minute wait for our food after ordering. Then after that wait, everyone's food was cold and the burger I ordered was so burnt that I had to cut the bottom of it off to reduce the burnt taste."
"3.0","Overall disappointing.The good-Perogis -Brussel Spouts-The atmosphereThe bad-The burger-The chicken sandwich tasted waaayy burnt-The bill ended up being 65 for two people and we both left disappointed."
"4.0","My husband took me here for my birthday. The food was delicious. We got the ribs, steak, and chicken and rice dish (the real names are in spanish). The restaurant was really casual though even though they charge $52 for the chicken & rice dish.If you do decide to splurge and go. I highly recommend the ribs for the small plate and the steak dish the large plate. Mashed potatoes were amazing. The chicken and rice large plate was tasty, but definitely overpriced."
"5.0","I love this little shop and was sad when I moved away - just out of walking distance. I still make the trip though - the breakfast sandwiches and friendly service are worth it. They have a good selection of coffees and always give orange slices with your breakfast. Don't come here in a rush or you will miss out on the great atmosphere and neighborhood feel the owners have successfully created."
"3.0","I was happy to see this place when the Carnegie Cafe had no decent veggie options and I needed food fast before an afternoon event.  Nothing remarkable, but it was tasty and filled up my tummy!"
"1.0","Poor Management.As I work in the area, my co-workers and I eat here at least once a week.Today, I experienced total disaster and bad behavior at this restaurant.Granted, they were busy with walk in customers and GrubHub orders, so the wait time became a half hour.The workers today sadly had one speed...'slow'...either management can't convince them to move a bit faster when you are busy or they simply hire the wrong people.I politely asked to speak to a manager. Three times a manager was called to the front and three times that person did not show to speak with me despite my calmness and professionalism.On my way out, I did learn that manager today was 'Dave'. Oh well...'Dave you need to find another line of work'.Poor service is never a good thing,Anna Bartolini Brown"
"5.0","Yum.  Went here because it was open late, and the menu sounded good - so glad we did.  Elegant late night feel and the food was delicious.  I don't live here, but if I did I'd visit regularly."
"5.0","Third time here and best time yet.Ordered the Inferno. Perfectly seasoned, just spicy enough, and fantastic mix of textures (crispy chicken, firm-white-gooey-yolk boiled egg, perfectly cooked noodles). I know ramen broth is sorta considered unhealthy, but I couldn't stop myself from drinking every last drop.Beer selection is highly curated; it's not a large selection (maybe 10 different choices), but they're all fantastic. Dogfish Head sour I got was one of the best I've had.First visit was fantastic. Second visit, I found my ramen to be a little lacking in seasoning, and I had to add quite a bit of the MSG and ramen pepper provided on the table to bring the Unami factor up. This one was done perfectly and I didn't add a drop of anything to it.It's a small selection compared to a couple of the other ramen shops in town, but what they have, they execute well. Hope they stick around for the long haul."
"1.0","Was looking for a good vegan brunch spot that has alcohol too, very hard to find believe it or not (young entrepreneurs looking to open a restaurant take note). So we decided on here. Go in and nobody greeted us for a table, so we ask a server who says 30-40 minute wait. An hour and a half later (literally) we get a text. Go in, get sat and sit there for 15 MINUTES without a server. We got up to leave and go to the abbey and the 3 tables next to us say 'ya we're debating just leaving too' another table says 'we are going on hour 3 here'. Went to the abbey instead, perfect brunch. Dont waste your time here"
"5.0","Yesterday, after a hard day of cleaning, Chris and I ventured out late at night (aka 9) to grab a bite. I have been wanting to go here since I saw reviews popping up for this place. It is close so we made a reservation with open table and got right in.If you cannot climb steps due to joints/vertigo/anything this is not the place for you. The steps up to the restaurant are steep and you have to go two flights up. It is a warning for those who might not make it. This place was thumping for a Tuesday night! I could not believe how packed it was. People were at tables, at the bar, and at the sushi bar! The tables are all high tops (eh) with backed chairs (a plus). Our table slightly sloped so that when we moved our water to the right it slid off the table along with my glass. I do not know if the table was sloped, the floor was sloped, or if the table was so waxy that it just slid right off. After that we kept our food and drinks to the left. So we started with the bites! These all were grilled on little wooden skewers. It was nice to be able to watch your food being cooked in the open kitchen. ROBATAYAKI W/TARE & TOGARASHI:Japanese eggplant -- Three medallions of eggplant. It was grilled perfectly and had a great taste to it. Chris and I both agreed for $1.5 we would get it again.Beef tenderloin -- Again about 4 pieces of tenderloin on a skewer. These pieces were really good. The marinade plus the grilling flavor, yum. But the bites were smaller than a bite so while good, probably not again. Then we moved to our 'main course' which I say in quotes because Chris decided he was not going to get a real meal but just dumplings.YATAI:Pork Gyoza: pan fried pork & cabbage pot stickers, rayu shoyu. Ok, at first I argued with him about this. I was like, 'this is $8, I could buy a bag for cheaper than that....' But I was glad that he talked me into it. These were not the usual frozen from a bag from the strip gyoza. These were handmade, delicious, and we ordered two of them. TWO! After Chris devoured one plate he said, 'can we get another?' I was not about to tell him no. They were fried together into a circle and had thin cut hot peppers that were slightly fried. I only ate THREE dumplings out of the two orders we got. He really enjoyed them. Tonkotsu Ramen: pork char siu, bamboo shoots, 5:10 egg, scallion, nori. I am a fan. This was a great dish. I will say that the waiter said it was totally split-able but in my opinion (so take that as you may) it really wasn't. There wasn't enough meat/broth/noodles to get a full split. I mean, I could have had more noodles and broth just for me. I really liked it here. It was a little dark so I didn't take pictures, we were seated pretty close to another couple and I didn't want to ruin their night by flashing pictures! Can't wait to go back!"
"3.0","This is an old school burger shop. I'm talking old school. Now I don't know the history of the place, but judging by the atmosphere I'd say they've been around awhile. (See pics). This restaurant was Smart, took advantage of the local teams rejuvenated franchise led by a guy with the last name Roethlisberger. They made a huge hamburger, named it The Rothlisburger aka Rookie of the year. Made with sausage and burger on a hoagie bun.  The NFL sat Chris Berman and Big Ben down and filmed them eating this massive Burger....... I witnessed this and told myself I would eat one of these things one day...... 15 years later, I got the chance.  I pride myself on my burger reviews.  I eat ALOT of them.... I love them. So naturally since I was in town, I tracked the iconic burger down. It was not nearly as big as I expected. But it was delicious.  I finished it and instantly wished I had ordered fries too.  I walked about a mile to get to this location.... Found out there are 3 shops in the Pittsburgh area and that I was not at the original.  Service was great.  I'll be doing my research if I return, I wanted to go to the original birth place of this burger."
"4.0","We came here for dinner and this place felt like home to me. Not fancy, not renovated, full of people keeping to themselves having a good time, GREAT music (no pop tarts here) and friendly staff. It's a bar/restaurant and it's all basic, good food. Our waitress was friendly and attentive and they gave us our drinks in mason jars which only made it more awesome to me."
"4.0","Yes, I am a fan. But, can't have this everyday. The food is good. Great take out or delivery. They are busy, so know what you want when you order. The sandwiches rival Uncle Sam's locally. These are not your Subway sandwiches; they are MUCH better. The steak sandwich, chicken, burgers, salads are all good. Recommend for a quick lunch pick up for the office!"
"3.0","This is a good place to go if you are looking for a casual decent meal along with a few beers. They pride themselves on their variety grilled cheese sandwiches, which I ended up taking their idea and making a better version at home...My fiancé and I got two different ones that they waiter said were popular and each had half a sandwich. We had the Cheesy Capresey and the Wang Chung Tonight. Like I said they were decent, not as mind blowing as they make them sound... But then again they are just sandwiches. We were really disappointed when we didn't even taste any Gouda on the Wang Chung. Regardless each sandwich comes with your choice of fries (regular, old bay seasoned or sweet potato) and a cup of their tomato soup. The sweet potato fries were good! I'm not hard to impress with French fries though. The soup was a bit too smokey for my taste buds but the fiancé enjoyed it.The ambiance reminds me of a college bar/restaurant. This may have to do because it's in an actual basement. There's lots of TV and just simplicity to the space. The actual bar area itself was small but cool. They have a TON of draft beers. Which I noticed a lot of people trying. I'm still surprised that this place was booked for the night in reservations on a Saturday when they're literally tons of better places around. We just decided to just go and play it by ear, luckily we waited at the bar for 25 minutes then were seated. No complaints on the service. Just a plain, ok meal. Not running back, but wouldn't say no to go back!"
"2.0","For $5 a pie, how bad can it be?  Great for the price, although I think it's not as good as Domino's or Papa John's.  I used to order mass amounts from this place for Student Dorm Council meetings at CMU."
"3.0","The quality pizza here really is a 2/5, the crust under the sauce and cheese is too thin to compensate for the floods of oil provided by the puke-smelling 'cheese.' I've never had a piece of pizza where I wanted to get to the plain crust at the end because its prelude was so miserable. Sorrento's does not apply a great amount of sauce to their pizza, and the oil only further dilutes the sauce's flavor.Ordering one of these pizzas and trying to consume it hot is oral suicide: prepare for intensive reparative surgery from the third degree oil burns that will afflict the entirety of your mouth. Often times, the only way to make this pizza bearable is to drop even MORE money on ranch dressing, which is essentially like submitting an early request on the heart disease that this lipid dense pizza is already guaranteeing you.Despite this negative review, in my Pitt career, I must have consumed dozens upon dozens of Sorrento's pizzas. Why? Am I a idiot? Am I an masochist? Perhaps both, but, here's my analysis...To graduate from the University of Pittsburgh WITHOUT drunkenly devouring a pizza in Sorrento's at 1:27AM while listening to Becky from Tower A cry about her ex at Penn State dumping her, is not a complete Pitt experience.Essentially, Sorrento's is a necessary and iconic player in Pitt's South Oakland late night lifestyle. Eating here is mandatory for those wanting a social college experience. I give Sorrento's 3/5  because as terrible as the pizza is, I will continue to eat it and continue to Hail to Pitt."
"5.0","My husband and I went to Cafe Raymond to see what all the buzz was about, and we were NOT disappointed! We went around 10:30 on a Sunday and it wasn't overly crowded. There were a few people in line ahead of us, but we didn't wait to order our food for no more than 5 minutes. The staff was super friendly from the second we walked in the door to the time we left. Once we sat down, our food was in front of us before we knew it. I got the ham & Gruyere croissant with an added egg, and my husband got the NY smoked salmon platter. Everything was so fresh!! We also split a raspberry and cheese danish, and it was delicious! One thing we couldn't help but notice was how CLEAN everything was. Everything was wiped down, the kitchen is open so we could see it all and it looked like everything was brand new. Maybe it was, but it looks like they run a tight ship, and we were very pleased about that. We will definitely be back soon. I have to try those pancakes I've been hearing so much about!"
"4.0","Came in with my bestie for a quick meal before hitting up the Warhol late night. She had never had Bhutanese/Nepali food, but her Bhutanese colleague had told her that Subba is the best example of the cuisine in the city. I've been to India and have eaten many a momo in my time, but am less familiar with the broad spectrum of Bhutanese and Nepali food as a whole. So we were excited to try Subba.As previous reviewers have stated, the restaurant is on the second floor of a fairly nondescript building and the decor is spartan. But the smell coming from the kitchen was out of this world! We were quickly seated and ordered--we had an order of steamed chicken momos, my bestie got the lamb Nepali platter, and I had the pork Nepali platter with a mango lassi. The momos were as good as any I ate in India, but SPICY--at first I thought the spice was coming from the tomato chutney served alongside, but the chicken inside the momos is richly spiced with turmeric, cilantro, onion, and hot chili. This is a flavor combination I truly love, but those who are squeamish on spice might want to pass these by or maybe try the veg momo. We gobbled ours up, and the delicious, not-too-sweet mango lassi took the edge off the heat.The Nepali platters are a stunning amount of food--for between $10-$12 you get a large bowl of your chosen meat curry, rice, dry curried veg, curried greens, daal, green mango pickle, more tomato chutney, and a small cup of kheer (rice pudding). It is a LOT of food but we surprised ourselves and ate it all. The pork curry was richly spiced and flavored with clove and cardamom (I bit into a cardamom seed so you know it's good!), the veggies (cauliflower, broccoli, potato, squash, onion, and celery) were spicy and tender, the daal was AMAZING--it tasted almost peanutty, a flavor I haven't tasted in Indian daals--and the pickle was garlicky, not too salty, and amazing. The flavor profiles were slightly different, but it reminded me of the comforting home cooking I ate in Indian homes. Rustic, like the food your grandma would make if she were Bhutanese! The kheer was delicious but a little thick from being in the fridge. They do offer it on its own as a dessert, and I bet the consistency would be better.Service was a little slow (only two people working the tables, and they spent a lot of time back in the kitchen) but the food couldn't be beat. I'll definitely come back for a big bowl of curry and more of those amazing momos. As Pittsburgh welcomes people from more and more places around the world, our food only gets better and better. I couldn't be happier."
"3.0","This place hit the spot on one of the first cold nights in Pittsburgh. Was it amazing? No. Did it fix my hankering - yes. Ambiance - is larger than may appear. Bar in the back looks fun and is probably where I would've picked to sit If there was space. Food - succinct menu. My favorite was definitely the cauliflower nuggets apps. They were fried and had a flavorful sauce and I'd come back for them. Ramen - My friend got the inferno ramen - when they mean spicy they meant it. He eats a lot of spicy food and wasn't able to finish it. It was definitely edible just didn't love the flavor. Flavor in the spicy tonkatsu was decent. Nothing unique or particularly striking about the ingredients and flavors. I've definitely had much better ramen BUT I had a craving and finished my meal. Overall good to fix a soup craving on a cold day. Get the cauliflower nuggets!"
"1.0","Spend your money somewhere else. The food is super salty and overpriced for what it is. Drinks take a long time to come, like 20 minutes. I've tried to like this place, really, but the last straw was the grouchy manager who was seemingly reprimanding a server on the floor? In this wonderfully diverse and vibrant food city, there are a ton of great places to eat... check out some place else."
"5.0","This is my favorite brunch place in Pittsburgh :) The place is so cozy, the food is always fresh, the staff are super friendly.Last time I got Nutella Banana Crepe, Vanilla Latte and Turkish coffee. The presentation on everything was so pretty! My crepe came up like bouquet of flowers, latte was topped with heart shaped foam and Turkish coffee was served in tiny cute cup! Everything was served hot and I really enjoyed my brunch! So this is definitely nice place to have breakfast and brunch!"
"5.0","An amazing place to grab breakfast. Some of the best and smoothest coffee I have ever had. The breakfast sandwiches are filling but feel light on your stomach while eating. It's a great place to start your day off. Love the staff."
"5.0","My boyfriend and I were first timers at Onion Maiden tonight, and it did not disappoint! Vegan or not, this is a place you absolutely need to check out. For a starter we got the emperor palpatots and subbed out the tots for tortilla chips. It came out super quick even though it was a full house which we loved just as much as we loved how good these nachos were. We also ordered and shared 3 small plates, the roots which is a super refreshing salad, the war dog which is a veggie dog topped with 'cheese' and jalapeños, and chivelords (see picture for reference because I forget what it exactly had in it or on it but it was my favorite of the night....before the dessert that is.) We couldn't pass up a good cheesecake so we got a berry cheesecake with a hint of lime taste to end an amazing meal with and it was so rich and creamy, one of my top favorite desserts now hands down. Also all of the employees were so nice and well mannered, for sure kale'd us with kindness (get it?) Surely we will be back again soon especially to try the donuts and brunch."
"4.0","The food was amazing I would give that full 5 stars!!! Unfortunately I had a bad experience that makes me give o my 4. I was not at the restaurant but delivery and I'm not sure if it was a normal person who works there or just someone that drives but he represented then and made it unpleasant.  I would highly recommend the restaurant. Everything I ordered was perfect!!!"
"4.0","Just landed from orlando, checked into hotel and found our way to garden cafe....good thing we stopped! Food was great! Service was great! Outdoors was fantastic ! I should have tipped 20% but your order and then sit down and I didn't realize the wait staff is a real wait staff not just deliver your food!I would recommend! We had grilled shrimp, garden tacos w shrimp, salads and also chicken sandwich."
"5.0","First time here and very pleased.Pamela's was a great little breakfast spot.My family and I were in town from Florida and everyone one of us walked away happy and satisfied. The food was delicious and the portions were out of this world. Yummy  5 Stars."
"3.0","Passable but not great.  Their best feature is staying open late (10pm).  Their 'hot' aloo gobi is what I would consider 'medium' spicy."
"3.0","Visited with my sister for a Thursday happy hour to try some snacks and ramen! The happy hour specials are pretty good, $5 cocktails, other drink specials, and some half priced apps!There weren't many people when we stopped by (one other party of two), but the inside has a lot of space and is very nicely decorated. Service seemed a little awkward - We walked in to a pretty empty restaurant, made eye contact with a couple of workers and the bartenders but received no greeting. After walking through the restaurant, we were about to just seat ourselves when one of the workers came up to us and asked if we were a party of two.We were led to a table and given menus. The waitress left and brought back water, and my sister asked if all of the apps were half off for happy hour (we only had online reviews to go off of at this point). The waitress seemed a bit monotone and grumpy, but replied that she'd get us a happy hour menu. We were a bit confused as to why we didn't receive that menu right off the bat, but no harm done.We ordered a couple of apps to share and a bowl of ramen each. The apps were really tasty - we tried the karaage and cha-siu bao. Both were really fresh and flavorful! I got the vegetable curry ramen. The broth was a lot less flavorful than I hoped, as were the other vegetables and tofu that came in it. The noodles were a good texture, but the dish seemed very bland, especially compared to the appetizers we'd just eaten.Overall, we enjoyed the food, especially the appetizers, but felt the service was not very friendly or attentive. If I visit again, I would probably go for more appetizers and maybe try an entree other than the ramen; they did have a wide array of noodles and stir-fry."
"2.0","Went for brunch/lunchtime. Immediately was pleased by the ambiance, very cute interior and friendly staff. However, pretty much everything else was disappointing to awful.The waitress gave us plastic bottled water when we sat down then asked us if we wanted drinks (we ordered iced tea and iced coffee). The drinks smelled and tasted off, indicating there is something wrong with the water. When we asked about it at the end of our meal after we got the check the waitress sort of played dumb about the water and then said she'd get the manager. We didn't stick around to talk to the manager because we were already put off by the whole experience. I didn't realize until scrolling through their yelp reviews that they charge 50 cents for the water bottles (no mention of that in the conversation with either waitress who helped us). Just really weird and kind of shady.The food was really disappointing as well. Avocado toast in my mind doesn't mean prepackaged guacamole and a cold fried egg. The bread used for both the avo toast and the French toast was terrible. Wouldn't go back after our first experience there."
"4.0","New(ish) joint from Justin Severino.  Tapas.  Spain by Disney.  Angry bartendress.  Boomin'/ crowded.  I was solo, so I had chorizo plate.  I have the same complaint about Morcilla and about Cure..... where I had steak tartare.  The concept/ vibe of both buildings I found inviting but in a Damien Hirst kinda way.Morcilla has gotten an infinite amount of attention and praise.  It's worth going to see what 'the best Pittsburgh has to offer'."
"5.0","YAY - Pittsburghers rejoice!  Finally a place to replace Pizza Sola/NY style in Pittsburgh.We stopped in on a random Wednesday at around 3PM to try them out and grab a quick slice.  We ordered a basic pepperoni which was really good.  Is it the best pizza I've ever had in my life?  No.  Is it high on my list of a basically non-existent NY style market in Pittsburgh?  Absolutely.  The service was great, chill guys working hard that really want to see the place succeed.  I will happily be back (probably at least once a week) to continue to support them!Pro-tip: Don't be dissuaded by the $5ish slice prices, these slices are HUGE and totally worth it."
"3.0","The food here was really good. I have never had Peruvian food so I can't compare this to any other place. The atmosphere is tight and casual (think diner), with South American stuff for sale. This place is good for lunch, but it's not nice enough for a date (not the first few anyways )."
"4.0","Love this place-cheap, convenient to work and delicious! I almost always get the chicken tikka, a samosa and mango lassi. The only downside is cash only, and they are only open for lunch (or a very early dinner :) )"
"5.0","Always spot on. Like many people before me, and many after will suggest, GET THE MOZZARELLA! Freshly made mozzarella ball with olive oil, balsamic, and sea salt on top and olives, roasted red peppers, and prosciutto on the side. Delicious... My wife and I each usually order a pasta dish and we share polenta.  The pasta is handmade, great texture and bite. The sauces compliment it perfectly. Polenta is creamy goodness and you can choose an ingredient to go with it (we have been known to go with the charred octopus normally) Haven't had a bad plate here."
"3.0","I've been meaning to give this place a try ever since I moved to the southside last summer.I love the concept- international street foods. They have a generous amount of starters and a lengthy list of sandwiches.I went with two other friends and we ordered a few plates to share. The prices and portions were perfect for sharing. I had really high hopes for this place but it just falls short. The flavors fall flat and over all the food is just okay.The service was okay and space is cute but a little cramped.If you've been wanting to try this, go for it, but if you're looking for a place that will woah you I'd suggest going somewhere else."
"5.0","Wow. Finally, a place in the Southside that has great food AND isn't over priced. You could go to one of the stereotypical, yuppie establishments and pay $10 for buffalo chicken dip or $14 for a burrito or you could come here and pay that, if not less, for delicious and unique food!When I came here my boyfriend got the special (a Cuban) and it was so flavorful. I ordered the Tapioca, inspired by the Laranieiras Market in Rio de Janeiro. It's basically like a taco but not with mexican flavor profile at all. You can pick what's in it. But that's the best way to describe the way it is served. The shell is made of tapioca flour so it's soft and slightly chewy. A very unique and welcome textural food experience. I ordered the one filled with duck confit, caramelized leeks, caramelized shallots, roasted garlic, smoked Gouda and drizzled with balsamic glaze. Wow. It was great. We also split the bone marrow. I have only ever had it once in a very fancy restaurant. This tasted almost exactly the same and was only $7!!!!! and we paid an extra $1 for more toast. But honestly, it was so good we couldn't believe we only spent $8. And the drinks and cocktails are on par as well. All around a very, very, very welcome place for the Southside. I recommend it to everyone, especially those who are more adventurous eaters looking for something unique and fun that won't hurt your wallet. We also found out that the restaurant is owned by a young couple who had this great idea for a food-truck concept that turned into an actual restaurant thanks to the opportunity of this location. Knowing it's a local, family-owned restaurant makes it all the better. Take a break from the places in Southside all owned by the same group and give this place a shot. You won't be disappointed."
"4.0","Great Feast of the 8 Fishes...they went above and beyond!  Salmon, whitefish, Monkfish, fish meatballs, a sort-of Ceasar salad with Anchovies and more!  Try the Bocelli Sangiovese."
"3.0","So we ate here before a Pens game because I rarely visit the Uptown/Hill District area I had no idea where else to go. We debated between here or hitting the Burgatory stand in Consol. I'm actually glad we picked Friday's, because we haven't been to Burgatory yet and the extremely abbreviated menu/pre-made food probably wouldn't have given us the best impression.  Anyway, our server was lively and the food was standard (I don't review chain food unless it's 'special' in some way). We got several appetizers  and drinks -- we were in and out in 45 minutes for about 30 bucks. We got to sit by a huge window, which was excellent for people watching on 5th."
"1.0","I was here with some friends a couple of weeks ago. I found the place to be very dirty, and somewhat disorganized. We were made to sit right next to the door leading to the kitchen and the restrooms. It was very busy, loud and disturbing area, with too many people moving around. There were flies around where we were sitting, and one of them walked all over my cup, and fell in the cup of my friend. Then, they brought a new cup of water, but with no ice. When I asked for them to add some ice to it, they basically filled it up with ice, with barely any water left. After they took the order, it took them almost half hour to bring the order out. They didn't bring everything together. One of my friends, who ordered or a paper dosa, had to wait another 10 min or so, and it was served cold. Since they are understaffed, there were no waiters to check on us to see if we needed water, or anything else, or whether the food tasted fine. The dosas were ok. Nothing to make them stand out. Also, the curry (masala) was served on the side at an extra price....to me that's penny pinching. I look for an authentic experience when going to Indian places, and this was far from one. And the filth, and flies, and level of service made the whole experience an utter disappointment. I would give them 0 stars, if not for the system expecting me to give them one star."
"5.0","First time at Benny's, the slices are huge and very delicious. Loved the vibe inside and Nick was great to talk to. I'd definitely go back."
"5.0","Great Burgers and atmosphere! All fresh organic farm to table burgers. Got the Maggie's farm burger which came with rum aioli, chilies, caramelized onions, and smoked gouda. Mac and cheese was delicious too. Friendly staff with quick service, and the owner even comes out to check on his customers. Will be back plenty of times in the near future."
"2.0","Twin lobster tails: extremely overcooked and tasteless. Was going to get whole main lobster and waiter suggested these were much better. I think they just had overstocked trying to get rid of :-(. Very slow service. Told waiter at the start we had to leave by 6:15 yet he dragged his feet getting one piece of cheese cake in the end waiting almost ten minutes for it. I won't eat at this location again.On the plus side they have the best bread basket anywhere.I must say the restaurant did call and offer to make it right so you can't really ask for any more then that. No ones perfect all the time."
"5.0","I came here for the first time with my fiancé and it was exquisite, we enjoyed two savory crepes and then finished up with a classic Nutella crepe that we shared. The decor is beautiful, reminds me of a Parisian cafe in France. The walls are covered in beautiful photos and paintings, each one more beisroful than the other. The environment is intimate yet spacious. I can't wait to come back in the summer to sit out under the rainbow umbrellas on the terrace!"
"1.0","If I was able to give negative stars I would. I just got home from here for a relaxing dinner with my mother and aunt, I just wish I knew the service would be so bad before so we could have gone to McDonalds and been more satisfied. It took 15 minutes for our rude waitress to even come over and greet our table with a half ass smile and what I would assume a migraine from rolling her eyes so much at us. As you can tell the rest of our meal occurred in the same negligent fashion as previously stated.  The best part of the entire evening was watching our waitress run to her gang of fellow lazy waiters and laugh and point to our table reflecting on our frusterations in a passive aggressive fashion. Furthermore,  after ordering a simple shot that sat at the bar for 20 minutes, we figured it would be easier, faster and possibly more pleasant if we simply went up to the bar. There was our second horrible decision. The 3 bartenders were even more rude as they aimlessly walked past us ignoring our orders; counting down the minutes until happy hour was over. I would understand if I was the only upset one but there was another equally frusterated party next to us complaining about the same horrible service. I have never in my life put up with such horrifying service and I normally would not write a review but this experience completely ruined our entire mood and evening. I will never ever come back and make it a point to spread the word of such a terrible establishment run by horrible customer service."
"4.0","Wow I feel so out of it... I didn't know about Peppi's all this time and I've been here for about 9 years. My goodness. Just recently found out about this place about a few months ago... and this place never lets me down. The guys work there are straightforward and quick with your orders. Me and my friends went for lunch on a Thursday and it was so crowded but thank god we found a table! I actually like it here much more than Primantis. Def will come back here soon for sure!"
"5.0","One of my favorite burger places. The food is delicious, the toppings are great. Quality options, good drinks and really close to the rest of Lawrenceville."
"5.0","It is the best biryani I have had in a long time. Very nice place to eat. Good service..."
"5.0","We went here for my birthday. The food was great + the staff was so friendly! If one hundred percent recommend this place to my friends!"
"5.0","I believe that the Summit is possibly the most underrated cocktail bar in Pittsburgh. Everything I've ever had there was top notch. Easily my favorite place to bring my out of town friends that want to have a drink and see some sights. And obviously only being a block from Grandview Ave, there are amazing sights to behold. Throw in a Duquesne incline ride, and it makes for an unforgettable night."
"5.0","Always a go to favorite of ours. The restaurant is family owned and they couldn't be better people. David and brother Hugo use family recipes and service is top notch. Not much I don't love. Their homemade chips and salsa, anything mole and tacos are our go to. We had a lovely lady bar tender that we had not met yet and she recommended some tequilas for us to taste and what was a Monday post gym meal turned into a fun night. Tequila will do that. Other best choice would be the stuffed jalapeños."
"5.0","This place is phenomenal from the moment you walk in the door until the moment you finish your leftovers the day after your dinner.  Let me start with the atmosphere: don't go dressed like a bum because you'll embarrass yourself and everyone else there, but I highly doubt you would be asked to leave based on your attire.  Jeans and a golf shirt is fine, but so is a suit and tie.  The restaurant can accommodate almost any attire.  The drinks are expensive but who cares because the food is in a category near its own towards the top of the proverbial mountain.  I am told that the menu includes entrees besides steak, but I have no foggy idea why anyone would go to this restaurant and not order a cut of its world class, corn-fed beef.  I had the porterhouse and I have serious doubts that I could enjoy a steak more than I did that RC cut.  Our server, Christian, only added to the experience by providing us with a welcomed sense of humor and a knowledge of the different menu options that bordered on scholarly.  Yes, you will pay 3 times more for a steak here than you will at your local chain restaurant, but you will also be eating a steak that tastes at least 5 times better than what you're used to ordering.  Go here.  Go hungry.  You won't be disappointed."
"5.0","This is the best pho that I have ever had. When I lived in Pittsburgh, my roommate and I came here up to three times a week. Since then, we have traveled all over the US and no pho has been comparable. I live in Philadelphia now but I insist on coming here every time I visit!"
"3.0","Maybe this is blasphemy of some sort, but Pamela's? I don't know what other people see in it.There's always a line out the door, so I rarely end up going there.  Why wait when there are 600 million other places within walking distance?It's cash only, which is basically a business's way of saying 'Hello, customer.  I really hate you, and want to make sure you have to go out of your way to find a way to pay me.'  It's like when someone intentionally gets a 2-door car when a 4-door model is available.  You only do that if you really hate your passengers.The food is, well, it's okay! But just okay.  The pancakes are super-greasy.  They're not bad, though.  I do have to put in a word for their corned beef hash, though, because evidently that is excellent.I would like to one day try their lunch/dinner food, though.  One thing I do love about Pamela's is the price.  It's dirt cheap, and that's great.But get a credit machine! It's not like you can't afford it! Stop abusing your customers!"
"5.0","Delicious and fresh. One of the best burgers I have ever eaten! Definitely try this place."
"2.0","I came here awhile ago and ordered one of the rice-based dishes with chicken (can't remember exactly what it was, and there's no menu posted online for me to figure it out).  The dish was dry and lacked flavor.  Perhaps I ordered the wrong dish here, since the Pho seems to be what they're known for.  As it were, I wasn't impressed. I don't remember anything being off about the service, so it must have been fine.  If a dining partner specifically wanted to try Vietnamese, I'd come back and try the Pho, but otherwise, I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, given that there are many better dining options on Butler St."
"5.0","Just ordered takeout from the Chinatown Inn and the food is absolutely AMAZING!! Delivered hot, fresh, flavourful, an absolute delight. I ordered the General Tso Chicken with fried rice and egg rolls. Delivered to my hotel is under 20 minutes. Would have walked to the restaurant, but it was raining, but the good thing is that delivery is a very good option. I would totally recommended this establishment. LOVE IT!!!"
"5.0","I'm so happy this place exists. It's exactly what I want for the North Side (and a little jealous it's not what we have in my neighborhood, Dormont). An inviting coffee shop with plenty of seating, and best of all fantastic food and drinks. While it's not a full bakery (they have cookies and scones), they do have a ton of really fantastic sandwiches and salads, made to order. I'm absolutely OBSESSED with the pear and chicken salad, that's mixed with fresh arugula, pecans and goat cheese. I can't not get it every time I'm in. But I have no doubt the other food items are killer too.. and once the summer ends I'll be forced to get something else seasonal. But that's not a bad thing!I love tea, so this is just the spot for me. They freshly brew all their ice teas and this summer my go to has been the peach oolong iced tea, that they lightly sprinkle cinnamon on. They also have a variety of loose leaf teas to choose from for hot or cold choices. I can only imagine what I'll get obsessed with once the winter comes along!The only gripe I have is that the service is on the slower side. If there's a line to order, it may take you a bit to get up to the front to order. The food, like I said, is made to order so it's not going to come out fast, but I wouldn't say it takes forever either. Just be prepared to wait about 15ish minutes. They have you covered on the wifi, so it's a great place for meetings and getting work done too. Like I need an excuse to come here though... I'm already hooked!"
"5.0","I am new to Pittsburgh and since I live in Shadyside, my boyfriend and I often walk to Walnut for some drinks and eats. Our favorite spot is definitely Cappy's. It has a friendly, laid back vibe where no one is judging you if you're not watching the Pens game, there isn't a gaggle of guys trying to hit on women (but polite conversations are encouraged), and I love that it's non-smoking in the restaurant/bar. We've become regulars on Taco Tuesday, where they have $1.50 soft & crunchy tacos, $3 burritos, and $3 Mexican beers. We've also recently had lunch there, and the Godfather sandwich is so delicious! The food is fresh, the service is always with a smile, and we keep going back for more. Maybe I'll see you there? :)"
"5.0","Great prices for the portions, absolutely delicious food, and a wonderful family-owned atmosphere."
"2.0","This place has gone so down hill. I used to like eating here at the casino but this last trip was awful. It was a Tuesday night, the place was empty and the service was god awfully slow. Everything we had was disgusting. We left all only having a few bites of our meals. The 'filet' COULDN'T have been filet. It was the driest, grossest meat Ive ever had. Tasted like a frozen meat patty. The crab mac and cheese had imitation crab meat in it...and the cheese sauce was scarce and completely flavorless. It was more or less a bowl of plain noodles with chunks of fake crab. Yum....never again."
"2.0","I REALLY wanted to like this place! The menu looked great, we liked the vibe and both shrimp appetizers were really good. The drink menu looked fun and inventive  BUT then the entrees arrived.... my husbands had the most potential. The halibut could have been lovely if not for being dry as a bone with bland flavoring and no sauce that could have helped the dryness. My salmon was just bad and sad  the crab on top was actually ok but the sauce was an odd mix of mismatched flavors and the salmon was so over cooked it could have been served as a hockey puck!! I might try again but would stick to apps and drinks."
"1.0","As you can see from my profile, I don't write a lot of reviews.  I use Yelp mainly to inform my decisions.  However, the burger at BRGR inside PNC Park was SO bad, I need to warn all of you to NEVER eat a burger from here.  The patty was so well done and so dry that it must have been sitting for hours before it was served to me.  I took one bite, spit it out and threw out the rest.  It was inedible.  What a shame given the reviews for the locations outside of PNC are decent - I'll never know if those are true or not because I will never eat at any BRGR location after what I experienced in the stadium.  STAY AWAY."
"2.0","I love crab cakes. Whenever they are on the menu I have to order it. I got the crab cake sandwich to feed my need for carbs on carbs. The crab cake tasted fine but in the end it was more filler then it was crab. When I eat a crab cake I want it to mostly be the main event filled with large chunks of crab. Sadly this one didn't do that for me."
"4.0","Wanted to order from a new pizza spot and stumbled on this gem while helping.This spot reminds me of a place I loved growing up... crust is thin and chewy, little pepperonis collect the good grease, and I love when a pizza shop has broccoli.  They have homemade ranch to go with their za which is great!Would definitely order from here again!"
"5.0","OMG so absolutely flavorful and delicious!!! One of my favorite food trucks in the city! I always get the rice bowl with kimchi and dumplings. It's a perfect combination of flavors and textures. I follow them on Facebook because I must order their food a few times a month. Not only is the food good but the gentlemen who own the truck are some of the nicest guys I have ever met. If you've visited them more than once they will greet you by name! Such an amazing detail especially in today's world. This is a must try!!!"
"3.0","Decent burger place that opened in the Lawrenceville area. Apparently this place is well known in the North Hills area and they decided to open a location in the city. Great timing as I was coming off work & decided to drop by to try their wares. Ended up taking a Maggie's Farm (smoked gouda, horseradish, caramelized onions, roasted chilies, rum aioli, plus patty [medium rare, I chose]) and a half side of rosemary fries to go. As for the fries, they were decent though I found the rosemary a bit overpowering to my taste buds. Would recommend they go a little lighter with the use of such seasoning in general. As for the burger itself? Pretty good overall. I wouldn't place the patty quality as good as that of BRGR or Burgatory as it was also rather lacking in flavor/juice, but I'd probably consider such passable and better than fast food burger patties (a slight step up). It's nice that they have a build-your-own option though that's probably more expensive, sandwiches, shakes, sodas, salads, other sides, and more so that's a plus for food variety. Will have to try other things and update accordingly. Overall though, would recommend other places to go for better tasting burgers."
"3.0","Thai Gourmet's food is just 'pretty good,' but I keep going back because I like the meal experience there; it's the only Thai place I know of where you can eat at a counter and they keep Christmas lights in the windows all year. Because it's in a narrow row house and decorated like your great aunt's living room (assuming she's the kind of woman who loves wood paneling and house plants), the ambiance is unpretentious in the best way possible. Standard Thai dishes like pad thai, green curry, larb and pad kee mow are solid, but other classics that should be equally solid, such as salad rolls, tom kha gai soup and panang curry always leave me wanting more spice, depth and--I hate to trot out the most clichéd foodie term ever, but--complexity of flavor. Thai ice tea, contrary to popular belief, can be done wrong if it's wwwaaaayyyyy too bitter or wwwaaaayyyyy too sweet, but these guys whip it up good.I also like to play menu adventures here: this is the game where I ask the server (one of the owner's daughters) what's good and then pick whatever sounds most crazy. It's been awesome at helping be break out of my Thai food rut, which previously consisted exclusively of fish cakes, papaya salad and panang curry."
"5.0","They make the best pizza I can buy.  We get one a week ( during Football, basketball , hockey , and the Olympics, and during special holidays.  What I am saying is, we order a lot of pizza. Before we found Wiseguys, it was a gamble. Sometimes the pizza we would buy from many different parlors  was ok, and other times it was terrible. But since we started buying Wiseguys pizza, we have been very happy with the pies we get. Sometimes Dar picks em up, and sometimes they deliver, And we're not easy to find. We live in the woods. But either way the pizza is always great. We love their crust, and it all tastes good the next day or 2.  They are very polite on the phone and in person.  We tell our friends and family all the time how much we love Wiseguys Pizza . We have had them over to taste it too and they agree they are good at pizza.   Most important they aren't over priced. I'd rather tip well than to pay over priced pizza.   Wiseguys  keep up the good job.  We appreciate it."
"3.0","Love love love the location. Not the best option for dining, but you cant really beat the location or atmosphere here. Love that its river dining!"
"2.0","Everything went fine- but Literally asked what the deal was, they said 'corona are $3'. I had 3 with my girlfriend and they charged me $5+ each.   They took the opportunity to rip me off."

"4.0","Clean,tasty and delicious food the place is small but comfortable in general. The menu is good they have choices. The service was great. I love it and I would love to go again."
"5.0","My lunch here was fantastic. The owner is clearly a very nice woman who takes pride in the fact that she owns a small little shop in upper Lawrenceville. The quality of the groceries are phenomenal and the community experience is really one-of-a-kind. I stop in and get a sandwich every now and again when I'm in the neighborhood and I'm always sure to mention it to folks who are looking for a quick lunch on the go. If I lived in the neighborhood I would shop here all the time."
"4.0","While this place was good, I can't say it blew my mind. I had the omelette with bacon, ham, and spinach. It was HUGE, and it came with crispy homefries (potatoes). My boyfriend had the Blueberry Ricotta Pancakes which were delicious. Wish there was a hint of lemon to cut the ricotta and carb-heavy taste! Coffee was good. Service was good. Parking is a pain in the Pittsburgh Strip District - expect $5-$10 let parking with short walking distance to the restaurant."
"2.0","Food OK, service even less. Rather go to Ron's for pizza in Troy Hill."
"5.0","Salem's is my go-to market when I want lamb or chicken. They also have a solid amount of Middle Eastern food stuffs and spices, so if you don't have an Uncle Samir to ship you za'atar, you might want to shop around the market a bit.They'll cut any of their meats any way you want right in front of you and have prices that are not only affordably low, but surprising given the excellent quality of the meat. The only chicken I've had that's been cleaner and tastier than Salem's has been directly from the farm down the road from where I grew up. It's worth trying the pre-made marinades, too.I've only eaten at the grill a few times, but was never let down in the quality or consistency of their menu. The cafeteria section is presentable (nothing to fawn over) and a fitting location to pop a squat with a buddy or two as you dig in to the feast in front of you.This review is written with the market in mind and with the grill as an afterthought--seriously, try the meats!"
"4.0","Came here with a group of 7 and the restaurant was able to get us seated right away. The location is in Lawrenceville so there's plenty of street parking although sometimes you have to circle a bit to find a spot.  The restaurant itself has a good amount of seating in addition to a large bar. There is also a cinderlands warehouse which is the big brewery located in the strip district. This location has some of the beers on tap but does not have as extensive of a selection as their main brewery. In terms of food, it's typical American food with burgers/sandwiches in addition to main plate entrees. Everything the group ordered was good but nothing was amazing. They have a variety of beers to choose from  including IPAs and sours. I believe they change their beer selection every so often so there is always something new rotating through. Having been to both cinderlands locations I like the strip district one better. It is larger and more spacious and has a larger selection of beers available. Regardless if you're in the area stop by and check it out."
"4.0","As a newbie to the entire Pittsburgh area and dining scene, I was very impressed with this Spanish tapas specialist. We were visiting from NJ this weekend and were taken here by our foodie cousins who were very excited to share this place with us. We arrived about 10 minutes late on Saturday night but no problem here. It was somewhat crowded but we were seated promptly. The waitress was so welcoming and ran through the style of food flawlessly and with enthusiasm. She made some pointed recommendations and was especially helpful when we told her that the majority of us are pescatarians. No problem... she guided us accordingly. We started with the matrimonio and marcona almonds. Wow! The bread with anchovies was really tasty and the almonds were surprising since the seasoning had a strong punch of sugar. If you don't mind starting off a bit sweet I think these are a hit. But if you're a bit more savory minded like me, maybe just stick with the matrimonio. They gave us additional bread which I initially thought was unnecessary. Boy was I wrong. Great to sop up all of the different flavors as each plate came out.We snacked on fried artichokes and octopus which were both spectacular. We opted for the pimento cheese snack which I admit felt like a gamble but was quite good. The beets and smoky goat cheese was out of this world. The main plate was a trout which was served whole but the main fish was filleted to perfection. The tomatoes and unctuous sauce were to die for, fresh and herbaceous. Really lovely. The zucchini a la plancha was also a nice small plate. Hazelnuts galore! We were quite stuffed but we wanted to try the churros. Our server was convinced we needed another sweet bite and gave us a complementary peach sorbet in addition. She recommended a dry sherry for the guys to sip on with dessert. Everyone was pleased. The service is so caring. Each course delivered so flawlessly but without any stuffiness and the bus boys came around and cleaned the table multiple times. It was a great dining experience in a pretty trendy but laid back way! Would definitely recommend this place. Apparently the restauranteur is opening another local spot very soon. Run don't walk to Morcilla. You won't be disappointed."
"4.0","Cheap food, excellent service. Not being from a city, most Middle Eastern food joints I've been to caters to the bland American palate. Note this place. I can't wait to go back to Pitt and eat here again."
"5.0","In my opinion, Thai Gourmet has the best Thai food in Pittsburgh.  Being Southeast Asian, I've had quite a bit of Thai food, authentic and not.  Their food is authentic, and they say it is also family owned.  I have only came for the $10ish lunch special.  I don't know a better deal than that!My go-to choices are the Red Curry with chicken (spice level 7) or the Pad Z-Ew with beef (spice level 5).  They give plenty of food and I usually have leftovers at the end.  I'm never disappointed, whether it be the food or the service.The outside appearance of this place isn't the greatest, but don't be shy.  Thai Gourmet is nicely decorated inside, and the food is surely going to keep you coming back."
"5.0","It's been quite a while since I've had a breakfast that good, in fact it caused a complete emotional breakdown followed by crocodile tears of joy and hugging the entire wait staff! I had the eggs over BBQ Brisket Hash and it was so inventive and flavorful, I could t inhale it fast enough!  I've been sitting here for four hours not knowing what to do with my life meow....I guess it's time for lunch!"
"4.0","First time experiencing Peppi's and it did not disappoint.  I love the whole feel and set up of  this place.  After ordering our sandwiches at the counter, we took a seat in the dining room and I immediately became caught up with looking at all of the people photos lining the walls and with reading some of the various business cards patrons have placed under the wooden strips along an area inside the dining area. Perhaps I will decide to give Good Fellas Remodeling a call...or maybe not!  The Phantom Steak hoagie was very enjoyable and filling.  I am looking forward to another go at Peppi's!"
"3.0","I have an almost-vegan friend and she has heard good things about this place, so we went to check it out. We went on a Saturday noon and it was very crowded. It took us more than 30 mins to be seated. The decoration is very nice but the space is pretty small. They have lots of vegan food including cheese and hand-made chocolates that they bake themselves. The menu is medium-sized and decently explained. I had shiitake mushroom on flatbread and baba ganoush. My friends had falafel sandwich and avocado and raspberry toast with cashew cheese.It took them a long time to bring our beverages, but the food came in a decent time. My shiitake mushroom flatbread had too much kale and too little mushroom on it and it was greasy. Baba ganoush was delicious and falafel was good. The cactus drink had a weird aftertaste. None of us liked it. Their cashew cheese was delicious tho. In general I think they are short of staff. The food is good but not super delicious."
"5.0","This is absolutely one of my favorite places to eat, not just in Pittsburgh, but anywhere. My husband and I had lunch today for Valentine's Day and our waitress was the sweetest girl ever!! I left with the best taste in my mouth and also wearing a smile from having such a great waitress!! It's like sitting in your grandmothers kitchen, it doesn't get more authentic!!"
"4.0","Came here with friends to hang out and watch college football. The place was full except we scored a table in one of the private rooms on the side with two televisions.  Most people were watching the games from their table but there were people standing behind the bar.  Thankfully not a crazy wild young crowd as we prefer a more mature watching atmosphere. The four stars rating is for the space and ambience. I really wanted to love the food as it was not all pub level food offerings. I had the salmon with seasonal squash purée topped with micro greens. It looked amazing. But the seasoning and flavoring just wasn't there. My friends went with a mushroom flatbread that seemed to have been cooked too long and was too dry and brittle. Lots of drink offerings so next time, we come to watch sports (this is our sports bar of choice downtown) we'll stick with drinks and skip the food while we cheer on our favorite teams."
"1.0","food is good but really really bad service. I went there with my boyfriend and we wanted to sit in a four person table so we can be on the same side. But they rejected and said really insulting words."
"5.0","Meals expertly planned and delivered!  great tableservice and decent pricing for an upscale Steak house.  Chappellet red fusion vino was a perfect welcomed compliment to my Sliced Filet with mushrooms and baby onions and my brothers Filet Oscar was cooked medium to perfection.  The lobster crab cake appetizer was delicious ..homemade tartar sauce was a perfect topping. Fresh made mint lemonade and the dimly lit restaurant and all its beauty sealed the deal for a perfect meal.  When in Pittsburgh this place is a Must!"
"2.0","My husband and I stayed in Pittsburgh for weeks and wanted to have pho. I read about good stuff here but was very disappointed.We have had Vietnamese food in other states before but here is the worst. We ordered Pho hanoi and mixed fried rice. Soup has no flavour and it seems to have excessive MSG. EGG roll and fried rice is too greasy.Service is not friendly.We don't want to go back."
"5.0","Excellent​!!! fantastic food, everything was perfect from the temperature of my boyfriend's filet to my mother watering salmon to our awesome waiter!! presentation of everything was exquisite.

"5.0","Just got done with a tour of Heinz Field and we were looking for a bomb place to eat around the stadium and locals recommended Jerome's quite a few times. Coming from Cali on a red eye not even 12 hours ago we were starving so we made a decision and it was a great one. It is literally a 10min walk from the field and the menu is extensive. Lots of tvs were playing NCAAF and not bad pricing for the food which was very tasty. There are alot of signed plaques from athletes and celebrities as well as Steelers history glad we came in! #HereWeGo"
"5.0","I just ran across this place a few weeks ago and can't explain how pleased I am with my new find. As a fan or gyros, I can be picky about the ones I like; these ones are wonderful. For the type of job that I do, I travel all around Pittsburgh and I live finding places like this. This restaurant is a deli style, go up to the counter and wait at a table for your food type or restaurant. Though I only have tried the gyro combo (twice), I saw people ordering all kinds of other middle-eastern style foods, all of which look incredible. Two thumbs up, I'll be back."
"3.0","Came to this location to grab a bite to eat with family before the Lady GAGA concert at the Paint Can. Table had visible drink ring stains. Had to tell the waitress no less the 3 times to bring my Dad a class of ice for his Labatt Blue 20oz Can. Also we were overcharged for a substitute side item, were told it it would be a $1.50 up-charge, instead we got French fries AND the side we had substituted them for and was charged the full price for the substituted item, and we did not get the special sauce at all not on the side. First time at this location and probably won't return if ever in town again."
"5.0","Chevere has become Arepittas... but I beg you:What's in a name? That which we call an arepa by any other name would taste as delicious!This place is a family business. It is run by what seems to be a few generations of people and all of them give you that family vibe. They probably yell at one another and there is probably some older woman in the back smacking people upside the head when they step out of line. As I said in a previous review on Chevere... do one thing and do it well. They do that! Are the empanadas greasy finger food? yes of course! Are all empanada's greasy finger food? YUP. This place was my first foray into arepas and damn am I hooked! They've got the real coca-cola here, which pairs just beautifully with a hangover and some Venezuelan food. Honestly this place may be the key to curing your work week hangovers. Just make sure you ask for some home made hot sauce/salsa. It's the icing on the cake, err the sauce on the empanada. The staff is so friendly and welcoming and helpful. I feel patronizing family owned and small business is one of the most important things we can do. If you've never had Venezuelan food, than why not give this spot a try. If you are downtown and looking for something quick and delicious? Why not pop in to this little shop strangely located under a parking garage on Cherry way.They offer arepas, empanadas, tacos, salads, and there's sides too. Cash only. Great combo options. Great value for your money. Sure this isn't dirt cheap. Because this isn't your local taco bell-pizza hut, but the ingredients are fresh and tasty, unlike some drive thru fast food spot. Get in there, get some delicious, and tell all your friends!"
"3.0","Food is ok.. Nothing special bar food. But the service is honestly shitty.... We waited 10 minutes to be greeted my a server, who was standing around the bar talking. It was not busy.

No question we will be back, very soon!!!!"

"5.0","Three of us went here before a show and knew nothing about this restaurant. We were greeted quickly by Chad and escorted to our booth. He gave us a few minutes then came back to take our order and see if we had any questions. My partner wanted a flight of beers.  Chad asked what types and she told him sarks and reds. He asked if it was okay if he selected for her. She nervously agreed and she was quite happy with his selections. They have a very large selection of beers on tap and in bottles or cans. The food was very good also. I had fish and chips, my partner had a quinoa burger, and our nephew had a Reuben. Compliments to the person who made the decision to have REAL fries. We all agreed that the good was good and the service was excellent. We will return here."
"4.0","First time in PA. It's so cool that it's snowing. I haven't seen snow since I was a young one. I flew in from California for a conference and I definitely wanted to try something different- so I decided, hey, let's order some Moroccan food. I placed my order, paid cash, tipped the driver, and so far I am pleased with the experience. The driver was very friendly and nice. I ordered quite a bit of things this evening including: Falafel salad, Falafel Morrito Burrito, Falafel Panini, and fries. I'm sampling everything right now and I'm so pleased with the food. Thanks Beta Bites for my first Moroccan food experience."
"5.0","This was an amazing find. We always eat around this area and have never heard of it oddly until yesterday. I don't know how it snuck up on us! My girlfriend and I were extremely impressed with their food, prices, portions, decor, and overall atmosphere. Yesterday, we bought the mocha French toast, the Nutella crepe, and a cappuccino. The French toast came with a shot on the side you could pour on the toast which was delicious, the crepe was huge and was full of flavor, and the cappuccino was delicious in the mason jar! Our server was great as well! Our favorite part was the patio. They have rainbow umbrellas hung up all over the place with other cute decor all around! They also gave all the tables a free plate of cream puffs which were to die for! I was so happy I saw this place advertised on yelp, otherwise I don't know if I would have ever found it!! I would highly recommend!!!!"
"2.0","Very poor service tonight, over 1 hour to get our food which was cold.No bread, ice cold vegetable.Kitchen seemed to be backed up or understaffed. Waitress was nice.No apology from the manager.I would think they would offer a dessert for the problems, but no.   This place was so good when it first opened in the new building, but has gone downhill. It's sad, they don't seem to listen to customers.  The newest menus are physically a joke, cheaply made.They discontinued some of their best items ( snow top buns, crumb buns, Pittsburgh sandwich etc).The cream pies have an artificial whipped cream topping that's pretty disgusting, very greasy.The chicken noodle soup is still great.It's a shame that one of our only 24 hour places to eat is lacking in customer service."
"3.0","It's alright. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. Good drink options and beer selection. We were seated for 20 minutes while we debated getting up and leaving but decided to ask a server why no one had come by. A female server came back about 5 minutes later and jokingly mentioned she was arguing with the manager about something and thought her section was clear. She also sat down at our table to chat with us. I always find it odd when people do that.We ordered spinach dip which was pretty good. I had a salad which was okay and the chicken was really dry. My husband ordered a black and blue burger. It was cooked appropriately and tasted okay. Nothing crazy special about the place."
"3.0","This place is not too bad actually. It's definitely a rickety store front, but the food is not bad - you can get a small pizza with good toppings for a pretty good price. Not sure if you can get single slices, but you can get these personal pies. Not the best pizza you'll ever have, but if you're in the area and are pretty hungry it's not a bad option."
"5.0","I'm obsessed with this small, metal-themed all-vegan restaurant. The names of the dishes are all references to metal bands and songs, but overall the ambiance is friendly and cozy. But really, the food is the star of the show. The crucifer rising dumplings are phenomenal. Most of the food is Asian fusion, but they also service veggie dogs -- random, but I'm not complaining, they're super yummy. I ate there when stopping in Pittsburgh for a night, and will be sure to go back next time I'm in the area -- even if it means going out of my way. I even bought some of their merch."
"4.0","I really dig Hambone's for several reasons. One, it's a really relaxed vibe. It's not fancy, it's rundown and chill. My friends come here for gaming, so you might be able to see why we like the place so much! Drinks and food here are really cheap, and they have a small but nice collection of pinball tables in the back. The Elvira table is pretty amazing, and it's pleasure to be able to play such a vintage table. The drinks here are no fuss and to the point. I liked what I had, and there's not more to say on that.The appetizers are horribly greasy, but it's so good. Fried broccoli with cheddar, provolone sticks, onion rings, yum! Eventually I learned that there's a restaurant portion next door. When I went to this side, it was really awkward. Our server was either new or just socially awkward. He barely spoke, but he did his job, and we weren't feeling social anyway. I like their menu. I'm a vegetarian, and there's more than one option, so that's always good in my book. I had a southwest wrap and my boyfriend had a grilled cheese. We swapped half of each so we could enjoy the flavors. When they something will be spicy, it will be spicy. I was impressed! I'll probably be back to Hambone's a lot in the future. The food is cheaper than other places, it's cozy in there and it's perfect for a board game session or pinball. What more could a girl want?"
"5.0","Fresh, flavorful, and filling! Outstanding food and service. The gentleman in front of me today did not know it was cash only, and the owner told him he could pay double next time. This kind of service is what brings people back! Although I would come back even if the service was terrible, bc the food is outrageous. Currently my favorite lunch spot in Pgh. I love all the sides you get. The carrot slaw, cucumbers, hummus, chickpea salad, lentil salad, etc. all deserve to be on my platter. Well done!"
"4.0","Friday Night on Pittsburgh's South Side can be a harrowing adventure during which one can expect to encounter many varieties of the drunken yahoo. Recently, I caught a concert at The Rex Theater on that favored time of the week for 9-to-5'ers and was in need of belly fuel. It was then that I remembered Kassab's, an eatery I had not been to since joining Yelp 5 years ago. Thus, I'd found dinner.Having been fixated on gyros of late, I ordered one up and waited for a spell at a window seat whilst sipping on an effervescent ginger ale, taking in the nocturnal parade of hipsters, yuppies, bros, bimbos, drunks, punks, freaks, and attention-seekers on infamous Carson Street. Kassab's interiors merge the modern and urban with the rustic and folksy. Vibrant murals seemingly came to life on the walls as patrons chattered happily beneath them.As big as a rolled-up newspaper. Kassab's gyro could best be described as a lamb meatloaf wrap. The pita was more like a tortilla in that it was thin and somewhat bubbled and charred. The meat itself was butter-soft, my canines sinking through it easily. Filling it out was the standard lettuce-tomato-onion trinity with a tangy, creamy, white condiment that Kassab's calls 'Tahini sauce.' Call it tzatziki, yogurt or whatever you prefer -- this is what makes or breaks gyros, and the sauce certainly made it sing in this instance. While not reaching the gastronomic highs that other gyros in the Pittsburgh area have achieved in regards to my palate (see It's Greek To Me, Knossos, Lesvos, Mike & Tony's, Central Diner & Grille), Kassab's take on the Greek staple is as worthy a contender as you'll find.For dessert, I opted for a serving of their fascinating rice pudding. Thick like a custard, the pudding was seasoned with something quite occult that nearly intoxicated me with its licorice flavors. With my curiosity piqued so, I asked my excellent server about the secret ingredient but couldn't hear what he told me over the clatter (was this purposeful?). Nonetheless, the pudding was a marvelous and mysterious way to end my meal.The long, plump gyro and chilly, rich pudding kept me bangin' long into the early morning hours with not a single hunger pang. With so much upheaval occurring in the South Side, don't overlook Kassab's lest you miss out on some mighty fine and fairly economical Greek fare your damn self."
"4.0","I had the INFERNO RAMEN. It was very good. Things I liked: The egg was perfectly cooked and went really well with the dish. The flavor and spices in the broth was very good. The meathballs were very good. Things that I would change: The noodles were a little stiff and seemed like they needed cooked just a little longer. It would be nice we were able to select a level of spice on a number scale.The bowl of ramen was also $14-$15. That is suuuper pricey for a very economical dish."
"4.0","This was my first time eating here, and my first time eating at a vegan restaurant. I went for brunch on a Saturday and it was good! The menu is short for brunch but I would have been happy with any of the items. I got a cold brew coffee with soy cream, and it was definitely a 5/5 on the coffee. For my meal I got coconut yogurt with fruit and granola. It came with a side of tots and kale salad. It was delicious, but I was still a little hungry after. It was just yogurt and some sides so I guess that's on me, but overall good! I'd like to come back and try the full menu."
"5.0","I would seriously give place a 5....still will  do but their brunch menu is just that on a Sunday limited menu...but  great offerings,  very good for the dishes we ordered, great food & great service. Party of 3 for Sunday brunch.  Very, very pleased with the food, service.Cheers to Sofia: a super server who took very good care of us, answered all silly questions...about beer & food.Food- our experience- very, very good.Very well presented & delicious.The decor is very Pittsburgh. Not over the top, sports oriented.  For our experience, just a great place.My group not late night, are party people ( but the place has but does  seem to have many fans, after work crowd!)  For a lunch or a Sunday brunch I would suggest you go & enjoy.  Food good, well prepared & good service.Bottom line: good service, food well done, prices are great. This place  a silly, super restaurant that celebrates and supports the Pittsburgh spirit."
"4.0","Who doesn't love a place that delivers beer? And if you don't want it delivered, it's a super convenient spot to grab a brew or two!This place is one of my favorite new discoveries about Mount Washington. Packs & Dogs sells regular 6 packs, but also allows you to create your own 6 pack, which is really one of the highlights of going here. Not only do they have a great variety of beers (including seasonal favorites), but they also have a decent amount of ciders, which I am a personal fan of! During holidays, I have been pleasantly surprised by the amount of seasonal beers that are available (i.e. Halloween, Christmas).I love that Pack and Dogs encourages you to try new stuff that you may not have had an opportunity to try before, without worrying about not liking a whole case. Some beers are around $2, whereas others are upwards of $5. This place also has sandwiches, hot dogs, and fries that are all pretty decent. If you place an order for delivery, there is a $10 minimum food charge so you might as well go all out! I recommend a sandwich and definitely the chili cheese fries!"
"4.0","3.5 starsCHiKN is affordable, filling, and tasty--a good quick-eat addition to Oakland. The food is pretty salty which is why I think the chicken tastes better on the sandwich than by itself. The fries have good seasoning, but are nothing special. As someone who likes spicy food, I thought that the Medium spice level had a kick, but was not overly hot. The service was quick and their table/buzzer system seems pretty efficient."
"4.0","I've been to ChikN many times. It's great. The size of the sandwiches are very generous, especially in light of the price. My only warning - don't get your sandwich 'Damn Hot'. It doesn't matter what your proclivity for spice is or what ethnicity you are. It's indigestible. You will experience the worst stomach pain over the next 18 hours. ChikN sandwiches are damn good when not ordered damn hot."
"4.0","Stopped by with a friend on the 4th of July.  They were open where others weren't.  So!  we stopped by.  Had a couple cups of coffee, grapefruit juice and split a feta french toast.  Sweet + savory delight.  Going in, I had my reservations.  They have that kind of stuff on their menu.... interesting options that 'work' in special ways.  Service was terrific too.  If you're looking for 'other' spots in Lawrenceville, this fits the bill."
"5.0","Best pizza in my neighborhood. I could eat here every day. Yum."
"5.0","I'm going to precursor this review with the fact that as a 'newbie' to Pittsburgh, I have found most of my dining experiences sub par to any other place I have lived/visited. The Pittsburgh food scene likes to present itself as the next up and coming place but, so far, Morcilla has been the ONLY restaurant in Pittsburgh that has delivered a meal that I felt I paid a fair price for and received the exceptional quality, service, and ambiance that coincides with the pricing. First of all, we had to make reservations weeks in advance - I don't view that as an accolade of any type, but now I can at minimum respect why we waited for 3 weeks for a table. This place gets PACKED and based on dining style it makes sense. You absolutely need time to luxuriate and enjoy each bite and sip of food and drink in front of you - so tables are occupied by the same parties for hours (we were there for at least 3 hours).Second of all, our server (Sarah) was awesome - we had all hit hungry to the point that we wanted to order everything off the menu, she helped us reel ourselves in with exceptional advice and tips on her favorite dishes. She was super patient with us while we floundered through their salivating menu (seriously, I could order all the jamon and call it a day). We ordered a bunch of food to share: almonds, beef tartar, mushrooms, croquetas de jamon, chicken wings, patatas bravas, the Cecina dried beef, and Churros in hazelnut chocolate sauce. Food wise - we were in HEAVEN. The meat melted in your mouth and the chicken wings fell right off the bone (I've never had a better chicken wing in my life). The mushrooms & patatas bravas were both absolutely delicious, there was a unique egg situation on top of the mushrooms that formed this delicious sauce, that just tied everything together so incredibly well. We finished off the delicious food with perfectly fried churros and a hazelnut chocolate sauce you'd want to take home and bathe in. Of  course we tied this all in with a delicious bottle of Tempranillo and topped the night off with rather alcoholic, but super smooth G&Ts. My only issue with this spot is that I spent 3ish hours sitting in a rather uncomfortable chair (those could use an upgrade), but that still cannot detract me from saying I'd absolutely go back and sit in that chair for 3+ more hours to enjoy this spot as frequently as possible. Thanks for the awesome experience, Morcilla!"
"4.0","Subba is located at the corner of East Ohio and Cedar on Pittsburgh's lovely northside on the second floor of a very unassuming building.  When we arrived, the owner (I think) was in the kitchen helping the chef.  I know this because a friendly family that dines there all the time, and the restaurant's only guests last night, told me so.  We took a seat and he came out shortly thereafter to greet us with a mile-wide grin.  I ordered the Lamb Nepali and my mumsie ordered the Chicken Nepali.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but what arrived was a series of small silver bowls with a variety of ingredients surrounding a bed of jasmine (I think) rice.  I threw everything onto the rice and hoped for the best.  I was not disappointed.  Nepali not your thing?  Subba also offers a Chinese menu so you can chow on General Tso's 'til your heart's content (and it did look delicious).  At $25 total for the two of us, it was a cheap date and the food was wonderful.  On the spicy side, so be forewarned, but a lovely departure from the casino buffet which we were tempted to drown ourselves in after losing our collective shirts at Rivers earlier that day.  Give Subba a try. The owner is so sweet and the food so delicious - truly a diamond in the rough."
"4.0","We stopped here for apps and dinner the other night. The atmosphere was lively with a DJ and lots of young people. I would return for a cocktail and apps. I had the pork ribs ramen and it was just OK. The rib meat was pretty tough and the broth was not so tasty."
"2.0","This is a sports bar in downtown Pittsburgh with a long narrow setup. There is a bar along the wall with six screens behind the bar. On the other side there are tables. It has the layout of a bar, not a restaurant with a bar attached. I came in and sat at the bar and asked for a screen to be changed to a game I wanted to watch. They obliged; there was not much else going on in sports. The beer list has about 10 or so drafts, though not everything on their published beer list is in stock. I asked for a Dogfish 60 Minute IPA, but it was out of stock so I ordered a Southern Tier IPA. The food menu is standard sports bar fare, with a selection of burgers and sandwiches. I ordered a Tuscan chicken sandwich, which was fine, but the menu said it came with steak fries but instead came with chips. The main problems were in the service area. They had one overtaxed bartender working behind the bar, who had a little trouble keeping up with all her patrons. To top it all off, they committed what I feel was a violation of sports bar etiquette: despite the fact that I specifically asked to watch an NBA game, when the Pirates game started and a patron asked to see the Pirates, they proceeded to turn all six screens to the Pirates game. Despite being a violation of etiquette, it was unnecessary as the bar was not crowded and there weren't Pirates fans throughout the bar.  At other bars I go to, they leave a screen on a game in progress that a patron is watching, or at a minimum they could ask if is OK to switch the game.  This bar would do well to heed that rule. The prices turned out to be a little on the high side. The IPA was $7 for a draft. That's kind of high, as I can usually get drafts of similar quality for $5.50 or $6.00."
"5.0","I came here on a Saturday afternoon on a whim and I will definitely recommend it to someone looking for a good brunch place. I ordered the Hawaiian burger and at first, I was expecting it to be dry but it ended up being very juicy and delicious. It had a tiny bit of a sweet flavor to it which I really enjoyed. I'm not a big potato fan but I enjoyed eating theirs. We sat on the second floor and would have sat outside on the balcony if it wasn't as hot. Definitely would come back again!"
"5.0","Was looking for smart food in a stylish but unpretentious, relaxed place, and lucked out in finding Station. Good wine list, concise, imaginative menu, efficient service that is helpful and never obsequious, delicious food (the fries are amazing and I don't even like fries), and then a couple of killer desserts. Good enough for foodies, casual enough for locals, Station deserves the good word of mouth it's getting. I wish it success -- just not too much, I'd like to still be able to get a table the next time I'm in town."
"2.0","Ok. Pretentious staff.Cool environment, but staff are driving a little too hard at the whole 'Hipster' thing. Everyone is dressed up to fit the part, but service not so good. Our server had an attitude like we were an inconvenience - was not good.Seemed like her image/attempt to seem hipster was her biggest focus.Food was good-staff is pretentious-price point way off."
"2.0","Went during lunch time and it was busy, but the cashier was pleasant and took my order quickly and accurately. The wait for food was a little bit longer than I expected (~13 minutes) and I could've gone next door and gotten some Thai Iced Tea had I not have the buzzer given to me. Once I received my order I briefly checked to make sure that my order was correctly filled and then left to meet a friend elsewhere since all the tables and seats were full. What I was not expecting, was a charred Chicken Frontega Panini -- despite the busyness of a weekday I cannot believe they had the audacity to serve such inedible food. though I had a to-go order and the priority is to provide fast service, I would've rather waited an extra 5 minutes for an edible Frontega chicken panini - as long as I was told (otherwise I'd be in the dark about the extra long wait for a measly Frontega chicken). By all means, the other half of the panini was great, but would've been better had I got to enjoy the entire sandwich that I paid $8 for."
"3.0","Solid American Italian food that's not making a pretense of being anything else.  The service was incredibly friendly, the food was well thought out, as promised, and in ample portions.  Half price wine on Monday and Wednesday. Will be headed back."
"5.0","Great selection, spicy, and incredible.Very friendly and accommodating staff. Very nice atmosphere as well. Parking is slightly difficult but they do have some assigned space. Highly recommended."
"4.0","Excellent food! We were visiting from New York and went on a recommendation. We weren't disappointed! The owner is named Pie (sp?) and he was very friendly. I had some of the best Italian wedding soup I've ever tasted followed by a very tasty pasta rustica. Save room for dessert!"
"5.0","LOVE this coffee shop! The urban atmosphere, spacious seating, and delicious homemade chai (my favorite) make Delanie's a win.  The two level seating, super tall ceilings, and hip atmosphere make this coffee shop stand out among others. Would highly recommend checking it out!"
"4.0","Prince of India has a solid, though not expansive, buffet. Last dinner buffet I had there included very good chicken tikka masala, saag, tandoori chicken, excellent chili chicken, turnip masala, vegetable korma, and channa masala, plus a small salad and dessert bar. Rice also, of course. You also get unlimited self serve soft drinks included in the price.At lunch, there is naan on the buffet, but at dinner you get fresh naan of your choice, which is a delicious upgrade. The buffet food is always good, but could be a bit more aggressively spiced. I understand why buffets are never spiced 'hot,' but some dishes here could just use more flavor. I have had a la carte several times, and it's excellent. However, as with other Indian restaurants, the portions are really small for the price, so I tend to stick to the buffet. UPMC and student discounts, too."
"4.0","I cannot say enough about this restaraunt! I took my mother there for her birthday and she left feeling special. The wait staff were absolutely wonderful. They were very attentive. We both ordered Halibut with a share of Lobster Mac and Cheese which by far is my favorite. For the sides we had the sautéed spinach and grilled aspargus. Absolutely delicious."
"5.0","This place checks all my boxes.  I had a super delicious VEGETARIAN PHO off their small but veggie-friendly menu.  My soup was full of broccoli, thinly sliced onions, mung bean sprouts, shredded carrots, and cilantro (YUM), and the broth was deeply flavorful.  It needed nothing extra.  However, I'm a fan of toppings, necessarily or frivolous, and Tram's did not disappoint.  In addition to the usual herbal accompaniments, every table was preset with a whole host of condiments to self-season your meal.  This tickles me greatly, especially for an eating experience such as pho.  Soy, hoisin, and oyster sauce, plus Sriracha AND sambal olek?  Tram's, I feel as though you get me.  And my huge bowl, half of which was boxed up for me to take home, set me back just $7?  YES, PLEASE.Our friends ordered the beef and chicken soups with extra protein and were super pleased with how much extra meat they were given.  My fiance had the PHO HANOI SOUP and is excited to try the Saigon and Sate styles when we return.Tram's is exactly what a pho restaurant should be.  Cheap, no frills, and unassuming.  Service wasn't super attentive, but my requests were honored ASAP when they were heard (extra jalapeños, please! and hot black tea--not on the menu but a much-appreciated basic).  This is a pho restaurant that makes me want to stop flirting with other pho restaurants and settle down.  This is the type of pho restaurant that makes me feel less depressed about summer ending, because at least cold weather equals soup weather.  I could eat this pho every week.  Tram's, I'm so glad we met."
"4.0","I've ordered lunch delivery from this place a few times since I work downtown and it's a quick, easy lunch. I was even more impressed when I went to the actual restaurant! This place is huge--you would have no idea from the outside. The best part is their egg rolls. They are definitely homemade and GIGANTIC. Apparently they also do jumbo egg rolls which I can only imagine are the size of a burrito since the regular ones are so hefty! I've had a few of the basic dishes here and have never been disappointed--Shrimp Lo Mein, General Tsos, Chicken & Broccoli. While I don't ever mind dark meat chicken, I know others who really appreciate that you have the option of ordering white or dark with their General Tso's platter.Whether you want a sit-down meal, take-out or delivery--this is a great place to check out!"
"1.0","This was a horrible experience at this store!!  I never had such rude customer service. I was treated like they just wanted to get me out of the store as quickly as possible and just threw my sandwich together really sloppy and rude like they did not want me there in that store.  I will never be back!!!"
"5.0","Went here for lunch because I wanted to do something other than the regular primantis or burgatory. I got a hot turkey sandwich and the bread is incredible (from mancinis). I actually ended up going back the next weekend. For some reason the first time that I went there was an onion type thing going on in the air and my eyes were burning but the second time that didn't happen."

"5.0","THESE WERE THE MOST DELICIOUS NACHOS I HAVE HAD IN MY LIFE. Such a great late night food option. Having a tough time in life? Come here. Your problems will all go away. Nothing else will matter."
"5.0","This is the hole-in-the-wall of the Market Square restaurants downtown; I'd never have found if someone hadn't known where the door to the place is. I want to note now that I've only been here once for a spontaneous dinner date - and that only happened because Olive or Twist was completely and totally booked. But now I'm absolutely dying to go here again. The meal I had here hit the spot perfectly.I'm not even a major fan of Mexican food, so it's very rare for me to heap this sort of praise on Mexican restaurants. I ordered the pork quesadillas, and have to say, they were spot on - also a surprising statement coming from me, because I'm not a major fan of pork, probably because a lot of the time people overcooked pork dishes when I was younger and I grew up thinking all pork is just dry and pretty tasteless. Places like Las Velas remind me that nope, this is not the case - and bless them for it! My meal came with plenty of both the main course and the necessary toppings to spread on each individual quesadilla as I saw fit. There were more than enough toppings to go around, and combined with the juicy pork and toasted quesadilla wrap they made for a wonderful mix of tastes and textures. By the way, even if the food wasn't amazing here, I think I would still consider myself a major fan of this place just because of their supremely delicious Peach Margaritas (dying to go back and try the raspberry one). Fortunately the food is as good as the drinks, so everyone wins!I'll note that even on a not-so-busy night, I, like other reviewers, experienced a little teensy bit of drag in service. Still, I had company and we wanted to talk, so I think as long as I avoid coming here alone or when I'm starving, I'd be able to tolerate this as easily as I did during my first meal here. Still, I can see this being a drawback for folks, so just know it's a possibility here and be prepared. Bring company or a book."

"3.0","I usually don't do this, but I am going to say it was just o.k.  I went there for dinner to try something new.  I got the chole and my date had the dal makni.  We ordered the samosa and garlic nan.  I was going to order another appetizer, but the waiter said that you couldn't choose the spicyness of the appetizer.  He then explained that you are able to pick the spiceyness of the main dish.  This leads me to believe that the appetizer is pre-made and not made to order.  As someone from this region I am utterly sick of this kind of approach.  You are in the hospitality industry, bend to the wim of the customer!  The samosa's came rather quickly and there was 2 of them.  So, that means I got to eat one samosa and Elisabeth got to eat one samosa.  Would you even call that an appetizer?  Our dishes came out and they were not tiny, but not that great of a portion size.  Although you do get a salad with the small bowl of food and some basmati rice was it, maybe?  I am glad that we ordered nan and the appetizer because I would have ended up very hungry.  I like that they are trying new spins on Indian food, but there was nothing that really excited me and made me want to come back.  I did try some of Elisabeth's dal makni.  I have never had black lentils before so that sparked my interest, but it tasted like a dull combination of chili and soup.  The service was speedy, but the staff is like their food very unexciting.  Oh and I was going to order alo gobi and the lion stout originally, but there were out of both  :(P.S. - the website makes it seem as though there is a bar an area to hang out in, but there is no such thing.  The bar is basically the check out counter, it is very small.  I would hardly call it an actual bar.  You can order from like 7 choices of beer that come in bottles, no taps whatsoever.    It reminds me of what India garden when it was on Atwood would have, King Fisher, Lion, Sam Adams...etc."
"2.0","Margaritas are extremely Good,  the food isn't to bad. The service isn't great at all. Had to ask twice for more chips before our waitress finally remembered to bring them over. Waited over an hour for our meal and when we started to realize people that had come in after us and was leaving before us was happening, we asked our waitress where our meal was to only find out there was a 'screw up in the kitchen' . We were going to see a show and had to rush to eat once our meals finally came out. Make sure you have time to spare if you decide to eat here."
"4.0","Delicious food at an affordable price. Meat cooked perfectly (we had the chicken Shawarma and lamb shish kebab) with flavorful sauces (highly recommended trying the side of garlic sauce for $0.25!) hummus is fresh and delicious. Highly recommend stopping by for a quick, casual but tasty meal!"

The host actually brought table up from patio for us to have more room by the street, very pleasant. By far and away the service was incredible, best we have had in a long time, I wish I would had our servers name so I could mention it. She was great. Food and wine was super we will be back"
"5.0","Good lunch choice!  The $10 best friend combo is a great deal.  You get your choice of arepa, empanada, and drink.  I had the shredded beef arepa that had plantains on it and it was delicious and fresh!  I also chose the shredded chicken empanada, which had great flavor.  There were 2 homemade drink options (you can also choose from bottled drinks) - homemade iced tea lemonade and coffee lemonade.  The first one was sweet and refreshing.  You also get to choose from a number of sauces.  I did the garlic and the spicy avocado, the latter was not spicy.  It's a small restaurant (2 indoor and 4 outdoor tables), so get there early!"
"5.0","This place is a downtown must. Not fancy, by any means. But, that's why I like it. It is a great shot and a beer place and the perfect spot to grab a beer before a Steelers or Buccos game. I love the Roast Beef on Rye. I think they use Breadworks bread. Keep up the great work, guys."
"5.0","I was impressed in every way by my visit to Stagioni.  We were warmly greeted by our waiter, and he informed us of a $20 wine special (10 bottles to choose from for $20 on Wednesday nights).  For our first course, the Butternut Squash Soup with pomegranate and molasses was well balanced and nuanced.  I also highly recommend the Escarole with Gorgonzola, hazelnuts, and red wine vinaigrette.  They used an imported Gorgonzola that was flavorful and the roasted hazelnuts were a distinctive addition.For my main course, I enjoyed the Cavatelli with eggplant, tomato, basil, and Parmesan.  Delicious!  My friend had the Fettucini with green tomato sauce, also remarkable.  Both used artisan pasta, very fresh and of perfect consistency.For dessert, we split a Tiramisù, which was very good.The decor was impressive, and we enjoyed a relaxed conversation.  The service was impeccable.  Excellent value, especially given the wine special."
"3.0","The two biggest problems with hype? Being able to get a seat, and the increased expectations that can quickly lead to feeling letdown.Coca Cafe, for me, suffers from both of these, unfortunately. For years, I've been wanting to go, but I simply haven't found a restaurant in Pittsburgh that's so far ahead of itself and competitors that I'm willing to wait more than 10-15 minutes to eat. For once, we happened to be walking by just before opening and figured, why not!?!The atmosphere is pretty good. We sat in the back sunroom-like space. It was nice and bright. We also liked that every table was a two-top in that area, which meant that we weren't surrounded by the boisterous kids in the front of the restaurant. There's definitely nothing wrong with taking the kids to breakfast, but it's nice that the restaurant setup sort of creates a separation for people who want a more relaxed atmosphere.The service was decent. Attentive at first, then there were seemingly-long periods of time before we could place our order and get/pay our check. My water was continually topped off in between, though, which is always a bonus!Unfortunately, all of the positives were for nothing when I tried the food. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, BUT it wasn't even close to deserving the hype. There are breakfast spots all over the country with reasons to wait. For challenge-like, but delicious 12-egg omelets at Beth's in Seattle, incredibly decadent pancakes at The Bongo Room in Chicago, Cap'N Crunch french toast or Sweet Baby Jesus at Blue Moon in Baltimore. Those places have specific things that are worth the wait. Nothing on the menu touched on any of those levels. Nothing over-the-top. Nothing truly unique. My challah french toast with brie, fig jam, and fruit sounded brilliant, but literally had 2 strawberries and 5 blueberries on it. I opted not to cover it in maple syrup, hoping that it could blow me away on its own. Instead, I was hit with a lot of bland bread, with a few bites of delicious brie. It was decent, but I would've been truly bummed had I waited 45 minutes for such a dish. My wife's omelet was pretty good, but even if I had ordered her meal, I wouldn't have been blown away. Her potatoes were very basic, which I actually like, but again...who waits for 'basic' these days? The highlight of my meal was the apple smoked bacon. It was perfectly cooked (I prefer the chewier bacon), and a great balance of sweet and salty. Would I go again? Sure, but there's nothing notable that has me itching to return. There was nothing truly wrong with my meal or experience, but the hype had my expectations sooooooo much higher...which is what led to such disappointment around a perfectly decent meal."
"5.0","Very good and authentic Indian cuisine! Highly recommend this to anyone! The Gobi Manchurian is my favorite appetizer and Chicken Chilly is my favorite entree."
"5.0","I can't rate the food because I can here looking for unusual beers and dessert. The Yard had a solid beer selection. About 35 taps and a big selection of bottles. Some of your standard fare, but some good, unusual crafts as well. Much better priced than some of your other beers options as well... So let's get to the BEST part-dessert. I ordered 'Cause We Got High'. It is 'Peanut Butter/ Nutella/ Bananas/ Thick Cut Texas Toast/ Battered/ Deep Fried/ Topped with Melted Marshmallow. It's smells amazing!!!  Looks incredible!!  It's enormous!  (You definitely want to share it.). And tastes like crunchy, gooey, salty, sweet, sticky, chocolate goodness. It is a MUST TRY!!!!!!!!Now to go walk this off in freezing temps. LOL"
"5.0","The food was incredible and the service was fantastic. I went on a busy Saturday night and was impressed with how quickly everything came out from the kitchen. This is such a wonderful little restaurant!!!"
"1.0","Avoid at all costs ! The staff is rude and Ms Piggy ( as another customer referred to her as ) refused to serve our kids dessert while we had a drink at the bar. If you go you will leave disappointed ! I'm surprised they lasted a month let alone 100 years."
"4.0","This place was pretty good. I got the Szechuan chicken and it was really spicy, but I tasted a lot of hot sauce. The workers kept talking really loudly and there was no music playing, so it was really hard to hold a conversation with the person that I was with. This is a pretty good restaurant, but maybe there are others that are better."
"5.0","We've been visiting this place since before it was brick and mortar. Always delivers! Excellent food, creative menu. Just an all around solid restaurant. Such an awesome crew of owners as well. So down to earth, and talented!"
"1.0","Went to Coca Cafe for brunch with my boyfriend. He's been here before and was a fan, so I was excited to give it a try. We waited 30 min to sit down, okay fine, it's Sunday brunch and I feel that's pretty standard. We were finally seated and when it was ready to order the waiter told us that it would be a 40 min wait. I feel that we should've been warned about that long before we were seated, but we were hungry and so we waited and waited....and waited for over an hour. We finally got our food and the entree itself was okay but the potatoes were raw. We asked for a side of toast which was good but let's be real, who can mess that up. We waited for over and hour and a half for food and finished our meal in 5 min. We left the restaurant feeling underwhelmed and annoyed. Will not be back."
"4.0","I'm a rather huge fan of General Tso's, so it's often enough the first thing I try with any restaurant that offers it. It varies just a little bit, but whoever makes it on Saturday gets the exact consistency necessary for the sauce. The frying is also done expertly too, it's like the only Tso's in Pittsburgh that's actually crispy. Given that, and how close I am from work to the place, I'll be stopping by for their lunch special quite often."
"4.0","I've visited this place 3 times,  And I've enjoy everything, every time. Our food was hot and delicious, specially they're caramel latte..omg so good! !The server was awesome.  Can't wait to come back!"
"4.0","The bread, the wine, the MEATBALLS, pasta, shrimp, more wine!!! All perfecto ! And location at station square is amazing"
"5.0","They are open from about 11 Am - 3:30 PM Mon - Fri in the winter.They are open from about 11 AM to about 6 PM Mon - Fri in the summer.  According to my senior colleague (who has been at Pitt for over 20 years), this is the best food truck at University of Pittsburgh.  The food is certainly very good and inexpensive.  It's highly recommended for a quick eat near campus.  The portions are large, and you will likely have some food left over.  You can also specify spiciness.  The biryani (chicken, vegetable, shrimp, or lamb) is $4.00 for small and $5.00 for large.  I usually get the chicken biryani, which is cooked with basmati rice, coconut sauce, nuts, and herbs.    The Mango Lassi is good for only $1.50I think they make the food while you wait.  Call ahead if you want to avoid having to wait out in the cold or the lines."
"4.0","I had wanted to stop and eat here for awhile. I was so happy we finally made it there. The gentleman working was very nice and he explained that they always have cheese pizza, pepperoni pizza, sausage pizza, a veggie pizza, and a special of the day pizza. We bought a piece of sausage and a piece of BBQ Chicken pizza. We thought we would start with those and then try another piece or two . . .until we saw how enormous their pizzas are!!!!  I have never seen pizzas that huge!!! . Each piece of pizza was $5. Plain cheese is $4. Whole plain cheese pizzas are $30 and others are $35. The pizzas are so big that you could feed two to three families from one pizza. The sausage is not your typical sausage. It is sliced and the size of pepperoni and not crumbles. I wish that they weren't sliced so thin. It was very good. The BBQ Chicken was our favorite of the two. The BBQ sauce was finger licking good. The chicken was real. It was in nice size chunks. I wish the pizzas had a little bit more cheese on them but the pizza is very good. The pizzas are very thin crust until you get to the edge where it's more like a typical hand tossed crust.  Even though the crust is thinner it stands up to the toppings. Take a group of friends and go try it. Enjoy all of the artwork o the walls!!"
"5.0","I came here for a lunch with my coworkers to celebrate the holidays. We made a reservation for their small private room, which suited our needs perfectly. Our server was excellent and extremely knowledgeable about the menu, and was very friendly. I went with the rose to drink, which was delicious. We started off with the calamari appetizer for the table. This was my first time trying calamari, and I was super nervous, as I am not a big seafood person at all. The calamari was served fried with a sweet & spicy Asian chili sauce. It was honestly delicious. Now, some people who are true calamari fans may have found it to be too fried, with an overpowering sauce, but as someone who doesn't appreciate calamari normally and would hate a more chewy or fishy taste, I found this to be quite delicious. I even went in for seconds! The bread that came before our meal was fresh and very tasty. For my lunch, I went with the 6 oz. filet (medium) and shrimp ($32). Many of my colleagues went with the same thing. We all highly enjoyed it. Personally, I will say that I expected the shrimp to be a little larger in size, but they were still fresh and tasted very good. The filet was the most tender filet I have ever had in my life. It was served on an extremely hot plate and was sizzling at the table when it arrived. The server recommended that you order the steak a little more rare than you normally would, as it will continue to cook on the plate. That advice was very well received from me. It was delicious. I ate the entire thing and was in heaven the whole time. Overall, I was blown away with the meal I received and although this is a more expensive spot, I highly believe it was worth the price we paid. We all had a great time and I would love to come back."
"5.0","This place is great. Fresh food, great atmosphere, and a pleasant staff. I couldn't have been happier to go on a date here! I'd definitely recommend the Tagliatelle and popcorn panna cotta! Divine! Parking might be a little tricky on busy nights, so, plan accordingly!"
"5.0","A true Pittbsurgh tradition! One of the best sandwiches / hoagies in town! There are a ton of different choices and they are all good! The bread is always fresh from Mancini's Bakery, another Pittsburgh tradition! You can't go wrong when a sandwich is on Mancini's!"
"3.0","Went for brunch a few weekends ago with friends. Food sounded great on the menu but then was largely bland; missing that special something. Service was fine but not stellar. We tried the breakfast hash (best of the three things we got), the panko crusted eggplant Benedict (blah), and the lemon ricotta pancakes (tasted like something I could make from a box at home). Cappuccinos were also meh. On the bright side they were fine with us sitting at our table and chilling for a long time."
"5.0","One of the best happy hours in town. Amazing $8 cocktails and delicious $6 apps. Highly recommend. Haven't been for dinner. Yet."
"5.0","Simply marvelous dining, and truly authentic Japanese Cuisine. The food is stunning, all carefully prepared to allow you to experience the complex and subtle flavors that are the hallmark of Japanese cooking.Our server was very attentive, and contributed several helpful suggestions regarding my menu choices. Several vegetarian options are available.My only concern is the absence of a Shōchū drink option.  I loved the soft Jazz playing in the background, very typical of a fine Japanese restaurant. There's a terrific Japanese ambience overall. Very impressive!"
"4.0","This crowded little place was very friendly, and the gent running the room gave me his personal table, complete with his newspaper. I ordered the veggie spring rolls and a beef pho. I can't say I was a huge fan of the rolls- something about the tofu and texture of the rice paper skin tasted like they'd been made a while back. The pho was delicious and well seasoned though, and they have salted lemon drink- very hard to find in the US. Overall a good spot to get your cravings met."
"5.0","Best PHO soup I've ever had!  It also helps me get over colds faster-- like Jewish Penicillin, but Vietnamese.  The Fresh Rolls are very delicious too.  My husband loves the Spicy Prawns."
"4.0","Blazing saddle is my favorite and the Cajun fries are delicious. They are cash only but they have an ATM inside. There's paid parking on the street. Lunchtime can be busy so I would suggest ordering ahead of time."
"5.0","Fantastic spot to relax with a cup of tea or coffee. Wide open high ceilings make a space feel light and airy. Wonderful service, nice selection."

"5.0","Super friendly staff and delicious grapefruit slushy (less sweet option!) with bubbles and lychee! YUM."
"5.0","Onion Maiden is a very worthwhile restaurant to seek out, it's probably the only heavy metal themed vegan restaurant in the world, or at least that I know of...so it is unique in that regard.  There are signs in the bathroom commanding you 'heathens' to wash  your hands.  And all employees must carve Slayer into their arms before returning to work!The food is great and I don't know how they made the vegan deviled egg for the ramen that I got, but it was delicious.  The whole dish was great and I wish I could go back there again, but I don't live in the 'burgh....I am not a vegan or even a vegetarian, but I highly recommend this place, restaurants that are plant-based, but just serve good food are something that should be commended.  Good food is, simply good food.  Go meatless...you won't miss it all."
"4.0","This place was delicious. We were here for a short trip and just happened upon it. I got the stir fry and my wife got a beef noodle soup and they were both great. The employees were very kind and helpful. Highly recommend giving it a try."
"4.0","Eadie's is a great little place to stop in and pick up a tasty bite for lunch during a busy workweek.  A cup or bowl of hearty chili packed with juicy roasted tomatoes always warms me up and lifts my spirits on cold winter days. The chicken tortilla soup is also a good choice - perfect amount of spiciness!"
"2.0","I was hoping for more, the way people talk about this restaurant. The decor was nice, and probably the best part. Very cramped inside (I had to continuously move my chair in and was repeatedly bumped by waitstaff who never apologized). We had to wait outside for a while before being seated. The food was a let-down, but only because of the hype I had heard. It was okay, but just okay. The dessert was good, but nothing was worth the price. I hear they have a vocalist some nights, maybe we'll go back for that and dessert, maybe a glass of wine, but only if we're in the area. Overall, okay, but not stellar."
"4.0","Doce got it right by appealing to the quick lunch crowd. Service is fast and the food is good. The price point is great at $3 for a freshly prepared signature taco. Food was always pretty good as far as the 10x's I had eaten there over the past 2 years, keep it up with the fresh ingredients."
"4.0","Very good but not spectacular. Charming small place in 'Little Italy' Bloomfield. Usually can get seated any evening and this place has a nice assortment of menu choices.The 'senators peppers' which is an appetizer of sauteed peppers, garlic, EVOO, and tomatoes is really tasty and flavorful without being too spicy.This is a pick your pasta then pick you sauce kinda place. Service is fine. House salad dressing matches the greens perfectly.Alexanders is food allergy friendly and they have GLUTEN-FREE PASTA!But this is not an over-the-top place, but then again, the prices are not over top either.Recommended."
"1.0","Ordered a delivery through Grubhub, as I was in a semi hurry. They quoted a 1 hour delivery and I agreed and ordered. At the 1 hour mark, I received a call from Beta Bites stating their driver delivered my food to another house (not sure I believe that) and that they were willing, yes willing, to make me a new order and send it out. I stated that I could not wait and please refund my credit card. The gentleman suggested I call Grubhub, or he could call. I called, only to be told I could wait up to five days for a refund. HAHAHA. Never again! The shame is.... I liked Grubhub and used them quite often. Really guys, get it together, a little customer service may go a long way. Try it."
"5.0","This is my very first Yelp post, and I think it says a lot that the quality of this restaurant prompted me to make a Yelp profile. I'm not vegan or even vegetarian. And i would eat here everyday. I've been back 4 times so far and have every intention of making this a regular spot. Great food and service! You have to try the baba ganoush and the avocado toast. they have a great tea selection as well. Highly recommended."
"2.0","Went in later in the evening for a steak and a wedge salad. Drinks were great bartender was friendly. Steak was decent but not 'Ruth's Chris, Morton's, Capital Grille' worthy. My salad came out hot like they had put it in the warmer or I don't know what happened. I will definitely be sticking with Ruth's Chris as my high end steakhouse of Pittsburgh."
"5.0","Can't believe I haven't been here more frequently! Do not forget to order the lentil soup. It's easily the most delicious lentil preparation I've had at a restaurant. The service is quick and without frills. LOT of food for what you pay, so go hungry. There's an attached market with middle eastern foods and I always stock up on dates, ayran, lentils and so on."
"1.0","I would have loved to have eaten here but the only item the worker would let us order was a personal dish pizza. This was not an issue, but after paying and waiting for the pizza the employee gave my meal away to someone else. When I questioned this, she simply told me she already served me my food. Absolutely terrible way of doing business. I will not be back."
"5.0","Amazing pizza! And super fast delivery on a Sunday night. We got half meatball and half pepperoni. The meatballs were delicious."
"1.0","Worst experience ever. The pizza delivery took 1 hour and change, got wrong size pizza, breadsticks were horrible, no grated parmesan, no garlic sauce. Called store to complain and they did nothing. Actually returned pizza to shop and they said they would give us $12 credit. Called back later and found out that it was a $7 'food credit' and no one remembered that it was supposed to be $12. Owner was rude and claimed that we were lying about our experience and said that if we didn't like it, we could take him to the local magistrate. Won't order from them again ever."
"4.0","Went there for dinner tonight. It was delicious. The spring rolls and egg rolls are amazing. Really might the best of both of those that I've ever had.  The service definitely leaves something to be desired but it's not horrible and they're friendly there. They just kinda need help with their customer service. But the food is great and fast and not at all expensive so I can overlook bad/weird service. Recommend this place!"
"1.0","This place sucks. Went in late on a MONDAY for a couple beers. I like the ipa's. The beers were 10.00 each! AYFKM! My buddy got Liney and they were 7.00. Never again Redbeard!  You got me this time...but you won't anymore!"
"5.0","Fried chicken is probably one of my favorite so when I've seen this spot recently opened I knew I had to stop in one day. So forwarding months later... I finally decided to come in after getting bubble tea couple doors down at Fuku. It was after 8pm on a random Saturday night and to my surprise it wasn't too busy so I was happy that I got my food within like 5 mins after I ordered. I got the 3 piece chicken tenders (medium spicy) with fries and boy those 3 pieces are worth it! I promise after those 3 pieces and fries and a drink you'll be good to go! Besides the food, I like that they have outlets with USB ports by the tables! So smart & convenient. Wish every restaurants will have this in the future whether it's in a college campus or not!"
"3.0","The carnitas was amazing! But the gringo and the spicy beef were dry/a little bland. The place was fun and had good service.  Would go again but just get the carnitas."
"4.0","Three words. Birthday Cake Pudding. OMG. Salad bar. Get at it, yinz guyz! I love EnP and we go way back to my teenage days working as a hostess for my first job and then server through college. So I'm a fan for life. Now my experience is a little different because I have a toddler and I'm gluten free. Of course, it's perfect for kids and their choices are great with many options of fried mac and cheese, grilled cheese, corndogs and so much more. Now that I'm gluten free, the options are definitely slimmer for me, but I appreciate they have gluten free buns so I can still enjoy a delicious superburger. I also love any of their salads, with fries on top of course. Warning, fries are fried in the same as gluten items, but I just eat them anyway (sorry to my stomach). There's a handful of items that aren't marked gluten free that you can alter to be that way. I often get the bruschetta chicken, but grilled rather than fried. I do wish there were a handful more items to get that are GF, but I'm appreciative there are a few out there to choose from! I do hope one day they start making gluten free smiley cookies!"
"5.0","This place is amazing, one of my new favorite restaurants. The brisket sandwich is my favorite meal on the menu, it's so much better than the brisket at the bbq places in Pittsburgh. Cocktails are also good and the service is great."
"3.0","Great restaurant for staple Chinese food. They have added Pad Thai to the menu. This is my third time to the restaurant. It is always good, but as great as it was three years ago at my first visit."
"4.0","Stopped in the first time just after 4:30 PM on Sunday (party of 5).  There were a couple empty tables as they had just opened at 4PM but soon all tables were taken.  Ambience was very old school Italian with copper table tops and grotto like room.  Service was very good.  Wine was good (I had the Pinot Noir) but a little pricey at $13 per glass.  They do allow you to taste the wine before you commit to ordering it.  I had the breaded veal chop for dinner ($40).  The flavor was very good but the chop was noticeably dark and overcooked on one side and probably shouldn't have been served.  The meat was very tender but a little on the overcooked side.  Probably would have been moister if they didn't overcook the one side.  They of course served the overcooked side face down (disappointing).  The bruschetta appetizer was very good. The mussel appetizer was average.  My wife had the ravioli ($27) and she said it was very good.  One of our party had the cocoa fettucine with pistachio, cauliflower and gorgonzola.  He said it was very good.  Another ordered the gnocchi and I had a bite and thought it was good.  We shared coconut cake, tiramisu and cheesecake for deserts and all were excellent.  I would definitely go again especially to see what the new menu has and also to see if the dinners were consistent from one day/season to another.  Overall I think the value was average for the prices.  Not great but not bad.  Hopefully my next time the rating will go up to 5 stars."
"4.0","10000000 stars but service, food is decent & overly priced. Would recommend the food in different states. The Pittsburgh location doesn't meet expectations."
"4.0","This place is great!I may go 5-Stars, but I've only been there once. I'll be back, so I may reassess. What I like:- FOOD was great. More below. - Service was friendly. Warm even. - Setting is cool. Very clean and fresh inside what must be an old building. THE FOOD:Mine was great. I got a Raymond Burger, which is a pretty standard, large cheeseburger, with shredded lettuce, tomato, and 'special sauce.'  It was served with a hand full of wavy chips and a huge dill pickle (that was excellent, I might add).  It was served very hot (my preference), on a pretty basic bun, but the bun was warm and very soft, obviously fresh. While there is no 'secret ingredient' to this fairly standard burger, the execution was top notch. The beef was cooked medium well (trace of pink), and was very juicy. Excellent. My side salad was surprisingly large and also very fresh and crisp. Comprised mostly of field greens, it did have some nice olives, cucumber slices, and other food stuff I can't remember.  It came with a house vinaigrette that worked well. I see lots of all-day breakfast items on the menu, as well as lots of other sandwiches and burgers, so I need to go back and try more. I definitely can recommend this place quite highly. Give it a try and fling us your take on it!  Yelp on!"
"5.0","When I was talking to a friend about chai tea lattes, she highly recommended Delanie's Coffee. Just hearing her describe the layout of the place (stairs that lead to open seats and a view of the shop) piqued my interest. Since it was only a 15 minute bus drive from Pitt, I went on the same day I talked with my friend. The verdict: Absolutely loved the drink and the ambiance! Definitely one of the best chai tea lattes I've ever had. Next time I'll be back to try their vegan sandwich."
"5.0","What a lovely evening.  Extraordinary food - a real gem in Pittsburgh!  We had pretzels with Pate and deviled eggs - amazing and such wonderful flavors!  The carrot salad was a healthy choice and flavorful. My husband's chicken and bread pudding was amazing.  The roasted summer vegetables were wonderful.  The service was terrific - we can't wait to come back - a great dinner!"
"4.0","I had been bemoaning the lack of good Indian food in Pittsburgh, as I felt like there was an embarrassment of good options in Boston, so my partner was like, 'Wait, I haven't taken you to Tamarind yet?'Tamarind is located in a renovated house, with very high ceilings, and unsurprisingly has a homey, but classy, environment.  I ordered a mango lassi, the chicken vindaloo, and garlic naan.  The mango lassi was a little sweet for my tastes, and I worried because they didn't ask me how hot I wanted the vindaloo: at a lot of ethnic places that means you get tourist or anglo-level heat, or 'mild'.But when the vindaloo came out it was fragrant and super spicy.  Enough to make my scalp itch [when I told my partner, she though I was a lunatic, so am I the only one who rates the spiciness of food by whether the sweat beads up and my head itches a little?].  Suddenly the sweetness of the mango lassi was just right!  More importantly, as well as being spicy it was delicious. The garlic naan was also tasty.  I will definitely go back.  I have to try the 'Chicken 65', described as marinated, fried chicken, there take on a classicl Indian street food.  While we were there, a party of about 15 people came in, all speaking Hindi to each other, and they ordered half a dozen plates of what I assume was the Chicken 65 to share: I need to get some of that!"
"5.0","This place is great! The burgers were juicy and perfectly cooked, the French fries were awesome, and the fried chicken was some of the best I've ever had! I would recommend this place to anyone."
"1.0","I've been here in the past and really enjoyed it. I decided to take my family there for Sunday brunch at noon since they were visiting for the weekend. I anticipated a 30 minute wait which is normal so we walked around the block to pass time. After the 30 minutes we were seated and ordered coffees and food. The coffee was quick but it took over an hour for the food to come out. There was another table that complained for the wait and even though the place was full, not one table had any food on the table. The manager said they were backed up washing dishes, and later when we asked the waiter said the kitchen was running behind on orders. Two different stories but finally after 75 minutes our food came out!The omelettes were ok but the potatoes tasted raw. When we complained about the wait the manager said it was normal and decided to take out coffees off the bill. It was a small gesture but she did not seem apologetic in tone despite saying she apologizes. The meal should have been free, the food was subpar especially compared to past experiences, and the wait was awful. A pirates player also happened to stopped by but because it took so long to seat his party he did not bother to return. I was thoroughly disappointed."
"4.0","Although we did not plan on going on here, we were flagged down by the owner to 'Come inside for Christ sake' and we were pleasantly surprised. Waitresses were very friendly and accomadating. We received free pie and the sit our dishes for us. If you are lucky there is one waitress who can realllllly sing, you might hear a late night tune. I'd go again."
"4.0","I have been wanting to try Luke Wholey's for a while and tonight was finally able to do so. We will be back for sure. Super good. It was a slow night (but also a Pens game- so that worked to our benefit) started with the Shrimp Cocktail and Calamari. Large Shrimp that were very good (just not chilled cold) but that's really my only complaint on the whole meal. Shrimp cocktail, to me, should be very cold. These were room temperature. I had the Shrimp Volcano. Mashed potatoes topped with Lobster bisque and shrimp. Very nice. The asparagus was perfect. My husband had the crab topped salmon and said it was delicious.  We shared the flourless chocolate torte and added a scoop of ice cream. Would recommend this place to anyone in the area."
"3.0","This is an ok restaurant I was there to celebrate a birthday and I was a it disappointed with the so so service I asked for the nicest table as it was a birthday and they sat us at the whatever table not close to the window which would have been better. The restaurant was not even full it was wed so again I don't get the lack of attention to detail Food was good noting extraordinary."
"3.0","Food was delicious but it was actually comical how rude our waitress was. Like I'm laughing writing this because I felt like we were being pranked. She ignored questions, explained nothing, and mumbled rudely while rolling her eyes at us"

"1.0","Service was slightly below average.  The food was horrible and burnt.  Even the soda was flat in a mixed drink.  We will not be going back to that establishment."
"3.0","This place wasn't good, but not bad either. I came to eat here with a friend and her family after walking in the Pittsburgh Pride Parade this year. When we arrived, it wasn't super busy. It was kind of clear that the wait staff was understaffed, as they were running around from table to table. We ordered our drinks and had a wait quite a bit before we could order our food. I went with the veggie quesadilla with extra guac instead of sour cream. Although the quesadilla itself was never basic and nothing special, the guac was really fresh and delicious. My friends and her family enjoyed their meals. We waited so long for the bill that I ended up giving cash to her family and walking out with my friend. I think this place has a lot of near by competition, considering they are in Market Square, and I think they should really staff more. It got rather busy as we were leaving and I can't imagine how overwhelmed they were when we left."
"5.0","The best restaurant in the burgh..I travel from California and this is my go to place to eat..sweet potato with vanilla ice cream so good"
"5.0","Love this place; definitely a good date night spot to check out without breaking the bank. We went in the afternoon a couple months ago and it wasn't packed but I got the sense it's pretty popular in the evenings. We both got ramen- which was delicious. If you go that route I definitely advise spending the extra money loading up on the toppings and use all of the chili oil they give you to amp up the flavor. You could definitely make your own ramen at home that would be just as good as this place (with the right ingredients) for a lower price but it was a nice break from cooking and the ambiance was very peaceful and relaxing."
"5.0","For those with late-night hunger pains, or interested in an incredibly satisfying greasy blend of cheese, tomato sauce, and crispy bread to really hit the spot, look no further than this welcoming pizza shop.The staff is so down to earth and friendly, and the ambiance is low-key and generally quiet.Things i liked:-Each pizza slice is the size of your head (on average). -Reasonably priced for the portion size and quality-A satisfying pizza to 'hit the spot' when you're in the mood for something savory, greasy, late-night-menu changes periodically (basil and balsamic was my favorite!)Things I didn't like:-toppings can be low quality e.g. mushrooms that look like they came from a canOverall, a great place to grab a hefty, filling slice of pizza! They will not disappoint, just don't expect anything gourmet."
"5.0","Walking into (or up to) Umami set the tone for what was a completely non-traditional Pittsburgh late night experience.  We went to Umami hoping for sushi, but arrived too late, as they stop serving sushi before the rest of the kitchen closes.  Thankfully, there were so many other amazing small plate options we didn't miss the sushi at all!The meat skewers were outrageously good...we tried the pork belly, and chicken thigh...and then 3 MORE pork belly skewers as they were on special for the late night happy hour.  Followed by the Takoyaki which was out of this world delicious.  We shared a Ramen bowl, and as recommended by our server ate that delightful 5-10 egg on it's own instead of mixing it in with the noodles.  I literally wanted to ask for a plate of those eggs all by themselves.  Sooo good.  The fried chicken with gravy dipping sauce was good, but at this point we realized our eyes were bigger than our stomachs...clearly a sign that we need to go back!I loved the atmosphere at Umami for a late night snack.  Dim red lighting, a DJ spinning house music that created a relaxing atmosphere with a touch of 'I almost want to get out of this seat and dance.'  Our server was wonderful and took time to help us navigate the very unique menu.  My only mark against the restaurant is that it requires patrons to climb two flights of stairs and did not appear to be wheelchair accessible, which means a very close friend will not be able to visit Umami. I hope I am incorrect and that perhaps there is another entrance? That is the only reason for 4 stars...otherwise...I don't have a bad thing to say!  It truly is an authentic experience and I cannot wait to go back!"
"2.0","I went to this restaurant after seeing yelp reviews. But I was totally disappointed with service and the time it took. We were in Pittsburgh for weekend and stopped by this restaurant for brunch. Food was okay, we were given one menu with limited options for course 1 and course 2. It took one hour for each course to arrive. And we ended up spending 2.5 hours in this restaurant!! Not worth it at all. And it spoiled our schedule for the entire day!"
"5.0","Great place late at night if you are hungry. Staff was very friendly and a great place to bring the kids."
"5.0","Really chill atmosphere and great ramen and drinks. I had a really good time. I thought the options were great and will definitely come back."
"5.0","I am so excited to write this review today! Gonna preface by saying I'm from San Diego. I moved to Pittsburgh over 3 years ago and have been searching tirelessly for decent Mexican food that would satiate someone from a city that is neighbors with Mexico. I just started a new job right around the corner from Bea's and holy guac I am SO impressed with their food! I got  Carne asada, pollo asado, and pescado tacos today for lunch and was THRILLED. The sign of a good Mexican place (in my opinion) is the quality of their Carne asada and this place didn't disappoint. Their salsa is also super spicy and delicious. I'm going back every week! Can't wait to try the California burrito next time. Highly recommend this place for authentic Mexican food!"
"5.0","Best Chinese I have got to have in Pittsburgh till date. Loved their pork friend rice and Kung pao chicken . Very friendly staff. Can't wait to go again!"
"1.0","We were so excited to check this this place out. We went on a Saturday and the place was packed. The host told us it would be awhile for a table and we told him we would take our chances at the bar. He told us they were at maximum capacity and that we had to leave. It didn't look that bust at all... we could have easily got to the bar. Guess they didn't want our business that bad. Super disappointing. Won't ever go back."
"5.0","Nothing but incredible dishes. The best place in Pittsburgh for sashimi and possibly one of the best Pittsburgh restaurants. Excellent if you want high quality sashimi rather than Americanized rolls. The robatayaki is also amazing as are the cocktails and even the ramen. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu."
"2.0","I live up on Mount Washington and love coming here for a quick six pack or bomber. Walked in today to grab a six pack, got what I wanted (which were some of the better stuff they had I'll admit) and went to the counter and WITH the mix and match discount it was $30+. I was told the new manager raised prices. As a customer review, I just want to let you know that they are a bit too high. Compared to other bottle shops around the area. Grapefruit Sculpin 5.50? I can get a pint of it for $4-$4.50 somewhere else let alone a bottle of it. Unfortunately unless I hear they lowered their prices again, I will be driving a bit further to other bottle shops instead of going to packs and dogs. I was told I wasn't the only one who mentioned they probably won't be back. I want to come back, please re-think the prices"
"4.0","If you love fried fish, get the Haddock. It is phenomenal. I also liked the deep-fried pretzel, and the server who was a really nice girl. The interiors are a bit dated, though. But then again, Hambone's seems to attract an older crowd and seems to have been around a good while.  I guess if it 'aint broke..."
"5.0","This restaurant is fantastic! It's located in this adorable house and has a great atmosphere. I had the garlic naan and the chicken tikka masala. The naan came with four pieces and I wish I had ordered my own instead of sharing it! The pieces were a little small so one order can potentially feed one person, if you have a big appetite (like me.) The naan came with three different dipping sauces and they're were all delicious! One was a white yogurt sauce, a spicy ketchup tasting one and a green zesty one. The chicken tikka masala was so good! I wish it came with more rice though! The ratio between meat and sauce and rice wasn't even in my opinion. The meal came with the meat, vegetables and sauce in a little dish along with rice and this zesty sauce. It was delicious! The sauce was creamy and yogurty! And the chicken was so tender and flavorful! This restaurant is truly a gem, come check it out!"
"5.0","I'm from out of state and I'm glad I found this place. Staff were very friendly and the food and coffee were amazing! I will definitely be back."
"4.0","There is DEFINITELY a lot of hype around this place. I knew that right when we walked up and there was a 1.5 hour wait time. I have a friend who told me before I visited Pittsburgh, that the brunch scene was up and coming, but this one stole the cake on trendiness. After the long wait we were finally seated and were able to place our order. We got the friend eggplant Benedict and the goat cheese and mushroom grits. The Benedict was meh, but the grits blew me away! Everything about it was perfection from the poached eggs to the mushroom balsamic glaze. I think this place has a few kinks to work out with service, but overall I enjoyed the food."
"4.0","Peppi's is a great sandwich place. I love getting a Philly style steak sub with a side of fries when I come. The portions of the sandwiches are generous and the bread is always fresh. The atmosphere is very casual and it's a good lunch spot.The staff is quick and friendly. It's an order at the counter and then wait for your food to be brought out kind of place. They also take call ahead orders which is nice because it can take a few minutes to get your food as everything is made when you order. I've only ever been for lunch and it's always a bit crowded but I've never had an issue getting a table.Only downsides are that it is cash only and street parking only. While I have not been to their other locations I would 100% recommend giving this place a try."
"1.0","This is the most ridiculously disgusting food I have had in a while. I ordered a Madras Masala Dosa and they used the potato stuffing of dosa in my other order of poori bajji. Aweful taste and nothing authentic. Staff is lazy. Avoid like plague."
"5.0","Located downtown, this corner bar is a great option for a quick lunch or dinner bite, and or beer. If you are going for a bite, when you walk in, you will head toward to back of the bar, where you will see the above head ordering signs and sandwich counter. You order the sandwich and pay there. While waiting for your most amazing sandwich, you can now order a drink at the bar (paying there). For those of you that have been here before, you know the run down. However, i was a little confused when i first patroned. The sandwiches are very very good. The woman that has made my sandwiches, every time i go, is down to earth and pretty patient with me (Thank god)! And the bar tenders are nice as well.  It's a very low key bar and not intimidating. I've eaten there alone and didn't feel weird about it. I have been coming here for the last few months, every few weeks, just to get my sammie fix. They are really that good!"
"3.0","My kids make this a must stop when we're visiting Pittsburgh. The staff are friendly and the food was great and greasy! We ordered the 'Big Nate', 'The 7' and 'Pitisburgher.' We will definitely stop by again when in town. Unfortunately, I had to take 1 star away for the cleanliness of the tables and floor."
"5.0","Very ethnic no taco bell here...the taste gave me a sensation of Mexico all i needed was a margarita or sangria mmm  so i bought a pure watermellon drink straight from the mellon....would recommend..."
"2.0","Disappointing.  The food was below average and the service was ok.  We were expecting a lot from this restaurant but it definitely did not deliver.  Pasta was not homemade and sauces mediocre at best.  Wine selection is very weak.  The outdoor seating is a redeeming quality."
"5.0","I have always been delighted with the service in this restaurant as well as the food and the decor. This evening I had the shrimp skewers. My wife had the fillet mignon kebabs and they were both served with a delicious crispy side salad and a wonderful rice dish. We were able to be seated on the street and it was a lovely summer evening so that was a perfect place to sit."
"5.0","This place is the real deal.  My father is Hungarian and I had lots of good Hungarian food growing up.  The owner here Judy and her husband Michael run an authentic Hungarian joint here.  We had a smattering of appetizers and shared two entrees.  Great conversation with Judy who shared her passion for Hungary and her heritage.  Great personal story.  Do yourself a favor and come here for great authentic comfort food."
"4.0","Super delicious food.  This place is a great place to for tasty pho and bahn mi.  We already get the pork bahn mi and our little ones can't get enough of their beef ball pho with extra beef balls."
"5.0","Ordered the picadillo and carne asada tacos, and they were delicious, flavorful and fresh. Can't wait to return."
"3.0","Decent lunch with poor service.When I first walked into the place, I was blown away. The restaurant has been newly remodeled and it looks great! There's a very hip feel and it's very clean. I liked the simplicity of the lunch menu.Though the place is small, it seems to be understaffed. There were three different waiters bringing around water but it appeared that only one person was taking orders. Wait time for the order to be place was about 15 minutes-- way too long for lunch. Wait time for the food was about 20 minutes-- also way too long for lunch.The meal was good and for that reason I will return. The price and service, however, were not as I would have expected."
"1.0","This place was overcrowded, overhyped, and overrated. It was just a bunch of racist people in their own clicks, drinking and playing shitty ass music. The whole place smells like old man cigar smoke, fish, and feet. They don't even dance at this place. It's just a typical, lame racist college bar. Nothing special."
"2.0","Way too salty it was inedible for me because of the salt."
"5.0","Healthy yet satisfying options! Between salads, warm rice bowls, and burritos/wraps, Freshii has a solid assortment of items and flavor profiles that bring me back multiple times a week."
"5.0","This is my favorite Shadyside breakfast/brunch spot. The food is amazing and doesn't take too long to be served. My personal favorite is the strawberry hotcakes. It's a cash only diner though so make sure you have cash before you walk over. The line can get pretty crazy around lunch time especially on the weekend."
"5.0","It took me forever to get here having gotten distracted when it first opened by spending the summer in Boston [sigh - I missed so much this Pgh Foodie Summer], so my friend C beat me to the punch and designated this 'Taco Taco - the Taco place'. It's pretty awesome and a fantastic addition to the South Side and Pittsburgh.The inside is small and simple with a counter and bunch of built-in barstools surrounding the Taco making station. It seats about 10 at the bar and another 3-4 at the window looking out on a busy carson street. The board is straightforward on the selection of 5 tacos. They are nicely sized and extremely juicy and the aroma is just amazing out the door, pretty much literally. Especially for the fantastic price of $3/taco. Yum, by far, my favorite is the Carnitas [Pork], followed by the Chicken, then the Carne Molida [ground beef]. I haven't gotten to the rest yet, but I'm sure that will happen sooner than later. Also I'm totally digging the Mexican artistic style of the chalk board. All together, love it and hope it sticks around for a long time. Last piece of advice, either come hungry or leave as soon as you're done. As you are immediately next to the food prepping, the aroma is constantly up in your face, and those who linger will end up eating and eating until you're through the entire menu. Gotta love it."
"5.0","Lets talk TACOS kids.  No, I don't mean those crappy wanna be Taco Bell type tacos ... I mean real, honest to goodness, fresh off the grill tacos.  Beef, steak, and chicken .... with almost any topping you could conjure up in that taco fueled mind of yours. Fresh as the day is long ... what?  I already said fresh?  Well I guess it deserved a second mentioning then didn't it? Everything is fresh ... Everything is awesome.  Edgar makes the world a little better with his awesome food.  I work 1 block from this place and sometimes I walk by just for the smell, 98% of those times I don't even make it a block before turning around and indulging my addiction.  That's right boys and girls .... Addicting is a word you could associate with Edgar's food.  Do yourself a favor ...... Go grab some REAL tacos, burritos, and every other 'o's' you can find here.  The 'o' is for HOOOOOOLY Frijoles this place is wicked awesome!!"
"2.0","I came here with a friend last Feb., and chose to visit it based on the positive reviews and the uniqueness of Peruvian food (I don't know of anywhere else in Pittsburgh that serves it).  Unfortunately, what I experienced was mediocre food and some of the worst service I've ever experienced.My dining companion and I were seated promptly.  After 10 min., the waitress came over and asked about drinks.  After another 10 min., she brought our drinks and asked what we wanted to order.  I ordered the special, which was listed on the chalkboard (don't recall what it was exactly).  The waitress took our orders and went back to put them in.Fifteen minutes later, the waitress returned, but not with our food.  Instead, she apologetically informed me that the special was not available because they were out of one of the necessary ingredients.  Um, why didn't she mention this immediately after she'd put the order in?  I chose a different entree (this time one of the regular ones), and the waitress went back to put that order in.It took at least another 15 min. for the food to come out (we'd been there for 50 min., for those of you keeping track), and when it finally did, I was quite underwhelmed.  I don't recall what I ordered, but I know it had chicken and I recall the chicken being dry and bland--clearly, not what I was hoping for in a Peruvian restaurant!  This shouldn't have surprised me, since I noticed the waitress preparing it in the microwave.  Pro tip to restaurateurs: If you need to use a microwave in your food prep, it's best to hide it in the back.  Having been to Ecuador, where the food is similar to Peruvian fare, the food here certainly didn't seem very genuine.Unsurprisingly, the check took at least 10 min. to show up once we'd finished.  By this time, I was through with this place.  Yeah, it has interesting decor, but that didn't make up for the abysmal service I received here.  Also, none of the people working there seemed to be Peruvian, which is never a good sign in an ethnic eatery.  Based on my experience, I won't be returning anytime soon."
"3.0","This place was just okay: nothing terrible, but also nothing super tasty. The atmosphere and service were good, but the food was bland. The taco meat wasnt very flavorful and the sides tasted out of a can. I think this place would be good for 20/something crowd out for a drink who generally are drunk so think the food is good."
"4.0","All you seafood lovers in Pittsburgh... Luke Wholey's is where it's at!!! After years of going to the strip district & eating at Roland's my boyfriend and I decided to check out Luke Wholey's for lunch instead a few years ago and were pleasantly surprised. Ever since then, I keep on coming back! The atmosphere at Luke Wholey's looks like something that would be at the beach! It is the perfect fun seafood ambiance. In the Summer, they open the doors to sit outside on the sidewalk as well- which I love! I've also never had bad service while eating at Wholey's. I've been here on dates with my boyfriend, nights out with my girlfriends, and even brunch on Sunday with my parents and have always enjoyed myself! Just about all of the food at Wholey's is fabulous. Some of my favorites include the lobster bisque fries (yes, a mound of French fries drizzled with lobster bisque), salmon, sushi, and ahi tuna. On my last visit, I tried the sushi for the first time after my friend raved about how amazing their sushi was. The waiter suggested the rainbow roll, so I gave that a try. It was super fresh and delicious. I also ordered a cup of the lobster bisque and a side Caesar salad. The lobster bisque is a little too rich for my liking- I prefer it over French fries more. I also love all of their specialty cocktails! I am not a bloody mary fan, but my boyfriend & dad love them from here! Luke Wholey's will always be a favorite spot in Pittsburgh for me."
"4.0","Good service and good food. Went in for Taco Tuesday.  Highly suggest the pork tacos.  Will be back to try other items."
"4.0","DUCK NACHOS. Enough said.  Those wonton chips are amazing and the proportions of each ingredient (shredded duck, cheese, salsa, etc).  They were on point and when we tried to get more they had run out.  We also had the buffalo shrimp, and wings.  We also ordered some short rib tacos (filling was delicious, tortilla was okay).  Our friends ordered the short rib burger which I have a bite of and it was delicious! But like I said before- all about the duck nachos.  They have a good beer selection and it is very spacious inside.  Outside seating is great but not as large so going back I'd try to make a reservation or get there early."
"5.0","For a special evening out I made reservations at the capital grill as it was a close walk to the Venus for out after dinner plans.  I was not disappointed at all.  Everything from the wait staff to the food was excellent.  I got the 10 oz filet and it was good but I honestly enjoyed some of the other items I ordered more.  The white cheddar potato soup was such a comfort like soup.  I wish I could have that allllll the time.  We also got the Brussels sprouts as a side and they were outstanding.  It is pricey for the average person so there is no way I could afford to go often but for the 'special occasions' I will return for sure."
"5.0","This is my new favorite place! They have my two favorite things .... Fresh great coffee and juice. It is a great place to relax or get your creative juices flowing. I love that they fully support other local businesses and the artwork they have on display is numbered by artist/name and for sale! Great atmosphere and the people who work there are always very friendly and helpful!"
"5.0","This might just be my new favorite go to spot! My carnivore hubby even enjoyed it! I had the blood orange turmeric kombucha which was so refreshing. We shared the hummus, fried cauliflower and tomatoes. The hummus was not too heavy and the tomatoes were so fresh. The zhoug (green sauce) was loved by hubby...too spicy for me! He had the kofta wrap and I had the cashew cheese flatbread. So much food we took about 1/2 home! I cannot wait to try this place for breakfast!"
"5.0","Fresh food yum. I stopped by during Ramadan for the late night buffet! It's over at 10z for 16.99. It's a really great way to try everything they have to offer. I wish they had a few more options for veggies but other than that great food"
"4.0","If I could give this place a 3.5 stars, I would. It was good, but not great, and the wait was really too long. This place really suffered from the high expectations of the 20 minute wait and the around the block line were simply not met. I had the corned beef hash, and it was actually pretty good, but far to greasy, and it didn't need to be. I also got eggs, sunny side up, which I suggest, not just because they were good, but to avoid the awful looking scrambled alternative. All in all, not bad, but the hype is probably undeserved."
"5.0","I am not a vegan but had an open mind when coming here. I got the kofta tofu scramble and was surprised about how much food they gave me! It was very good too - lots of flavor. I also got a coffee, which I wasn't too crazy about.I went with about 10 other people and the waitress was very attentive and nice - she even split the bill without us even asking. Would definitely try it again."
"2.0","Not deserving of the rave reviews. Breakfast is cheap, and definitely very poor quality. Grease is the common theme in food, and though it might taste OK a first, your digestive tract may say otherwise later. The space was cramped, we sat almost elbow to elbow with other guests, with my back a foot from a brick wall. The waitresses were extremely fast, except for coffee refills. Almost felt rushed because the bill came so quick; probably had something to do with the busy line in the waiting room. And why, in this day and age, are you cash-only, Pamela?"
"4.0","Friendly staff that really knew their regular customers. I was new and the lady working - who from what I could gather seemed to be the owner - was very welcoming and accommodating. I wanted a green tea matcha and am particular about how I like them (I'm *that* person lol) and she was knowledgeable about the matcha ingredients. She let me look at the almond milk ingredients and gave me the option of blending the drink or just having it over ice. It was cool being in the creative process. The availability of almond milk and pure green tea matcha were impressive. Only drawback is that the almond milk was vanilla and gave the matcha a funky taste, which the barista warned me might happen since I was deviating from the recipe. It tasted almost more vanilla than it did matcha, but I am a matcha fiend who prefers it with a teaspoon of plain almond milk.They also have loyalty cards which you can take with you or you can leave in an alphabetized old-school card catalogue style box near the register. I took one. I would frequent it more if it had wifi as I primarily use cafés for work, but if you're in Mt. Washington and need a pitstop, this is worth it."
"5.0","I loved streets on Carson! My cocktail, 'cynar the great', was delicious. I ordered the huarache, which was like a shredded steak flatbread-ish pizza with chiles or salsa verde maybe. It was delicious! I wish I would have ordered more food, but I'll save it for my next visit. I'm so glad I came and can't wait to try everything else on the menu. The service, art, and ambience were fantastic!"
"5.0","I ordered a burger, a two chicken tender sandwich and wings. The burger: I requested for my burger to be medium rare but my burger arrived medium. It still had tons of moisture. The flavor was perfect. The wings: They were perfectly cooked. They were crispy on the outside and perfectly juicy within. They were tossed with what i only can describe as a 'granulated garlic, white pepper wing dust'. Whatever seasoning blend it was gave it tremendous flavor, and I'd love to get a bottle of that seasoning blend. The fries: They were perfectly cooked as well. They were nice and moist on the inside, and slightly snappy on the out. They were also tossed with the same dust used on their wings. The chicken sandwich: The tenders were juicy on the inside and slightly crisp on the outside. They were perfectly cooked and the flavor was delicious! Overall: I would order from this place again. I wish i had asked for a menu. I enjoyed my food very much."
"2.0","There was a time when I ate at this Qdoba nearly every day, but those days are long gone. The food is pretty standard, but I got sick of paying $6-7 for a naked burrito with literally nothing but rice, meat, and pico on it every day. I also grew tired of the inconsistency of their meat. Sometimes the chicken would be overcooked and I'd just be crunching on charred bits of chicken, or the pulled pork would be nothing but fatty pieces. I just can't justify leaving lunch smelling like fried tortilla chips for the rest of the day if the food isn't even good.The service and cleanliness also leaves a lot to be desired. While, yes, I'm typically there during the lunch rush, the quality of both has never impressed when stopping in during the evening, either.Assuming you can find a bottle with sauce left in it on their messy drink stand, the only saving grace of this Qdoba is that they have Cholula hot sauce. With enough of that on my burrito, I can tough out nearly anything they'll serve up. Too bad I can't douse the staff with it, too, to give them a reason to act as miserable as they do."
"4.0","As I continue to travel, I indulge in random, some times hole in the wall places or more trendy upscale places. The Summit is a great spot for my 4th meal ever in this city. But before I comment on the food. Let's start with the Glogg: a warm mix of cab, port, almonds raisins and a few other details. Wow. On a cold winter day, I can only ask why no other bar/resto serves this. Truly enjoyed this drink..As for the food menu, it's the perfect size. A few snacks, a few small plates and then some large. I went for the pork dumplings, delicious! The stuffing is well seasoned and the soy sauce come out warm with a slight kick. I could've eating a box! I finished with some mussels, which were enjoyable. Two details I would change are the chorizo and the toasted bread. The chorizo is not as bold and if it were a nice ground Spanish/Mexican chorizo I think the flavor profile would go along way. And the toast, it would probably be better with buttered/olive oiled French bread rather than sliced white bread.. The. Bartenders were both extremely friendly and welcoming. Explaining the seasonal items and rotating menu. I didn't have any other cocktails, but they all looked great! For a Monday night alone, Tuesday date night, or with friends, be sure to check this place out!"
"5.0","I was in from out of town on a business trip and saw the yelp reviews for this restaurant. It was all that other reviewer's raved about it. The service and the quality of the food was outstanding. The halibut was well cooked with great flavor and save room for the chocolate mousse as it is absolutely amazing!  The drinks are hand crafted and also worth exploring."
"1.0","What happened.  I've eaten here for years and the last few months the chowder is now inedible it tastes like it's from a can."
"5.0","I have been here a couple of times (dinner and brunch) and we have always enjoyed ourselves!  I was here recently for dinner during the week. The wait staff was very friendly and helpful with ordering. For starters we had the octopus polenta and the butternut squash arancini. Both were very delicious! and would highly recommend (if you're not into octopus, definitely try a different polenta). I really enjoyed the pesto that came with the arancini!For our meals we had the gnocchi and the meatballs. I order the smaller portion of the gnocchi and it was the perfect size (with some leftovers). Would recommend both! I would definitely check this place out if you are looking for some fine dining in the south side!"
"1.0","I have never written a review on Yelp before. Never compelled to do so, but could not share about my experience at Mezzo. Awful. Took my husband and father out for Father's Day. Couldn't have had a worse experience. The restaurant is the middle section of a three tiered 'open warehouse' type atmosphere. Which equates to a balmy room with little circulation. The waiter was very nice, but service timing was horribly slow. Long time for drink orders and waited a long time for bad tasting food to come out. I ordered a margherita pizza for my kids and added bacon for them for an extra $2 and came out with barely a slice of undercooked bacon, which I took off bc didn't want my kids eating it.  Calamari was tasteless. Gnocchi was good. I had a $32 tuna which was over cooked and insanely salty. For that price, I assumed it was ahi Tuna and it wasn't. It also came with some black weird tasteless spongy cakes.  I couldn't really complain about my meal since my husband and father both had the Seafood pasta. They were both so dissatisfied that they needed to return the dishes. It was with a red sauce with indiscernible pieces of seafood slop. The waiter knowing that we were dissatisfied, spoke with the manager, offered them to make them another dish for which we had to wait another 15-20 minutes for. At this point, my kids kept saying Mommy why aren't we leaving yet. Waiter said manager comped us our few drinks from our tab, but NEVER had to decency to come speak with us ourselves. Which was probably the most annoying part of it all. The attempt for customer service recovered was non-existent and they seemed as though they didn't care. I have a degree in Hospitality so I know how these situations needed to be handled and some management or someone other than our server should have spoken with us. I go out to eat all the time in Pittsburgh and I was so disappointed that I failed my husband and dad for Father's Day and had to spend $200 to do so for my party of 4 adults and 2 kids (that had a $20 pizza)"
"5.0","I stumbled over Sammy's for lunch and I tell you what..  this little authentic deli spot knows how to make a great quick sandwich. They pride themselves for their famous corned beef , however they have other different cuts of meat such as pastrami salami and so on.Can't wait to go back there and try the pastrami. The sandwich comes built high (elevated) stuffed with meat and your choice of either coleslaw or sauerkraut in addition to your optional type of cheese. You can also add additional toppings. Sandwich size comes in two options half and full. They also offer lunch combos with a side and a drink for a value price.They have a full bar which I did not partake in .. As I am mostly there for lunch. The owner/floor manager was very friendly and attentive as well as the rest of the staff."
"5.0","Great beer, good burgers, excellent fries. Who'da thunk you could get cheap beer in Lawrenceville?"
"5.0","Whether you're a vegan by diet or just interested in try unique food - this is the place! The vibe/decor is edgy with a cozy/intimate feeling - perfect for a group or a date! We started with the dumplings and cheese plate; tasty to the last bite! And for the entrees, we opted for the Kimmy Gibler (loaded veggie dog) and Emperor Palpatots. Everything was so absurdly delicious and too satisfyingly enjoyable to pause to take a picture so my apologies! The meal lived up to the hype; so, we also went home with a slice of cheesecake AND their smoked Gouda - both as well as the rest of the meal come HIGHLY recommended! **Side Note: while I am meat-free/dairy-free, my husband is only dairy-free (allergy) and he enjoyed every bite without thinking for a second that anything was lacking. MORAL: THIS PLACE IS NOT JUST FOR VEGANS!"
"5.0","Peppi's 2, Pep Boys 0.Personal Experience: This was the second Peppi's I ever visited, back in the old days.I absolutely loved it! It took about 10 mins to make my Roethlisberger, and the whole time, the guy was telling me about the shop, about the sandwich, and asking where I was from and how I heard about it. He was fun and interesting and interested in me. It felt like I had a friend. That's the kind of service which is hard to come by these days.What's more, the sandwich was spectacular. It always is, but he seemed to make it extra greasy, and he put 2 eggs on there instead of 1 for me even though I only asked for 1. Some of the best service I've had anywhere, actually.I would come back to this location, or the Strip District one, over all the others. I love it. Best service. Miles better than Primanti's.And more info:This place has some of the best subs in Western PA, especially the delicious and appropriately named Roethlisburger, my favourite! Yum!Well, well, well. Long before I was ever officially into food and having friends and local fans of my music pick out where I was supposed to eat in any given town I was visiting, I knew about Peppi's. That was because I was once watching the Steelers on a given Sunday (during their famous Cowher Superbowl Winning Run I think), and I saw a special on this little sandwich place making a Roethlisburger. It seemed like they put everthing imaginable on it 'plus an egg'. The 'plus an egg' thing intrigued me, so when I finally made it to Pitt, I gave it a try.Plus an egg indeed! My word! It's actually spicy minced sausage (greasy as hell) with all sorts of goodies on it.... er... 'plus an egg'. It helps that these folks are some of the friendliest people you'll find. The Strip District folks asked for a signed CD and gave me a free Roethlisburger in return. The Downtown location gave me a free portion of fries because I had to wait about 30 seconds longer than they said I would have to wait. So really, whether you're looking for good service or good sub sandwiches (is that really a choice?), Peppi's is a great selection. I'm sure a lot of their other food is good too, but anyone that names a sandwich after the local hero and my favourite (joint) QB, is going to get my business, and since that sandwich is so delicious, it's the only thing I've ever ordered since I started going there."
"5.0","Before I review the restaurant and experience, I want to give a special shout out to our waiter, George. George is perhaps the friendliest waiter I've ever had the pleasure of having. He was kind, attentive, and had a wonderful sense of humor. Despite being extremely busy and waiting many, many tables, he still found time to not only take a few minutes to talk to us, but also to leave a hand-written note on our bill. George, if you read this, thank you again for the wonderful evening of service!!!Where to begin? Grille 36 has always been a favorite of mine, but I don't often get down there because the parking situation on the North Shore is always a big tenuous. As my girlfriend had never been there and as we were both in the mood for sandwiches from somewhere different, we decided to brave the Pitt game day parking situation and give it a shot.We were seated within minutes of arriving even though it was busy, which I thought was excellent as it was clear there were many people watching the second half of the game and lingering. Our server, as stated above, was wonderful from beginning to end and was probably the best we've ever had. I ordered the BBQ Bacon burger, which was cooked perfectly and had a wonderful blend of flavors. The fries were also excellent. My girlfriend had the Blackened Fish sandwich and she was very pleasantly surprised as well. We also took George's advice and tried the deep fried pretzels, which were one of the better appetizers we've had while eating out. The queso and mustard dipping sauces were very flavorful. We topped off our dinner with a slice of the carrot cake, which was enormous. We split it in half and still ended up with some to take home! You get a lot of value for what you pay and the selection is quite wide. We'll definitely be back!"
"5.0","My favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Incredible Italian meals and desserts. Very friendly staff and lots of gluten-free options! I love the create-your-own pasta. I usually get the gluten-free pasta with peas, hot Italian sausage and the gorgonzola (I think) cream sauce. The walnut ball for dessert is incredible too."
"4.0","What a wonderful gem of a restaurant!  I really enjoyed my time at La Feria.  I loved the casual and colorful atmosphere! The space is located upstairs from Pamela's restaurant.  The restaurant also has merchandise from Peru for sale all of which is fair trade merchandise that supports the crafters from Peru.It was great to be able to browse the items for sale while my friend and I waited for our meals and afterwards while we chatted.  My friend recommended the limeade which is fresh squeezed and was very refreshing!  We shared the  Sweet Potato Chips which was served with a cold queso-type dip called 'Huancaina' dip.  For our entrees, we each ordered the specials - one with chicken and the other with quinoa and peanuts and then we shared them.  The food was delicious and unlike anything I've had before in Pittsburgh.  The chicken dish was creamy and had a delicious array of spices, but wasn't hot spicy, just flavorful.  The quinoa dish was tasty and included cheese (fyi for vegans) but not a huge amount but it was warm and nutty - very satisfying.  I didn't buy anything on this visit, but I will plan on going back to browse the merchandise and support the crafters who produce beautiful work!"
"5.0","Truly exceptional. Went here for a birthday dinner and the decor is on pointe (to be expected b/c it's the same sign painter/designer as Sienna Mercato, Meat and Potatoes, Union Pig and Chicken, Industry Public House, Kimpton Hotel Monaco, OTB, Tonic, Sweet Peaches...) So that sets a nice first impression. Atmosphere is really nice, the space is clean and sleek - everyone in the party is hungry and ready for good food!Now on to the food! The best part about birthday dinner is it usually means a little bit more of everything because why not? You're the birthday kid! Get that extra cocktail! So we had a fair sampling of everything from drinks to apps and desert. We started out with some carrot and Belgian endive apps. The belgian endive was pretty good but the carrot app was stupid good. For my main. I ordered the Bavette Steak. It honestly knocked my socks off and I'm not really even much of a steak eater but my friend recommended it. It was perfectly cooked and served with little mushrooms and cauliflower in an amazing savory but not too salty reduced au jus. There is nothing I dislike more than overly salted sauces where all you can taste is the salt and none of the other flavors. The au jus with the steak was just right. It was salty enough, but you could still taste all of the mushroom and other subtle flavors. Great. I sampled some of the chicken and the pork that friends ordered and both dishes were also sooooo good. Particularly I liked the chicken.The bow lane was my favorite drink of the night and maybe in Pittsburgh period! Black walnut liquor is one of the ingredients. I've never tasted anything like it before and it is incredible. We tried both of the desserts - panna cotta and the lavendar cake. The lavender cake was fairly good but I would choose the panna cotta next time for myself.Definitely give this place a try!"
"5.0","The staff is one of the most friendly I have seen in the city. The food is amazing. The ambience is very relaxing and balanced. Absolutely love this place!"
"5.0","Rocky is the man. My dad and I used to eat here once a month while getting a haircut at Cercone's barbershop up the street. It was our tradition from about 1999-2004. I came back last year and rocky was still behind the counter serving up food the same way as always. It's home cooking with no frills. It's just downright good and hearty food."
"1.0","It took them 15 minutes to get me a simple soda! Another hour for my burger. Needless to say they didn't even recognized us at the table until another 15 minutes have passed by. Service it's horrendous and wait times for drinks and or foods it's even worse! What a horrible first impression this place leaves you with!"
"4.0","Had the chili cheez tots, tiramusu, deviled eggs, one of the kale bowls.   Tots were great, homemade (i think) and good and crispy.  Tiramusu was... generous. The damn biggest tiramusu piece I've had in my life and was the chocolate zone.  Would reclassify it as a choc mousse cake tho as it lacked the soppy moistness i associate with most tiramusu.  Kale and tofu bowl was superb.  Carefully fried and seasoned kale with ideally cooked forbidden rice.  It's easy to mess up kale and this was great. Cool place and patient servers."
"4.0","A solid 4 stars. The burgers are delicious, the rosemary fries are great! It's surprising rosemary fries aren't served in more restaurants. The quality of the ingredients is apparent. The drink prices are surprisingly below market value. The location and large windows are perfect for a Lawrenceville eatery. The only drawback were slightly cloudy and water spotted water glasses."
"5.0","This place continues to be my favorite Northern Indian lunch destination in the heart of this great City. The atmosphere is awesome from the decor to the the welcoming hosts and the authentic food. The garlic tandoori naan is great and is made in a real clay oven and has the great taste. The curries, appetizers and desserts in the lunch buffet are all so good. You cannot beat the atmosphere, price and location. You have to try this very well run established Indian restaurant."
"4.0","Great family owned pizzeria two blocks from Children's Hospital. They will deliver for free or it is a nice walk if you need some air and time outside. We ordered small cheese pizza, half meatball hoagie and garden salad. Pizza was good and the meatballs...WOW! You can tell they're homemade not frozen. Will be ordering from here again."
"5.0","This place is one of the best options for having lunch in the area. The service was fast and nice. I ordered glazed salmon. The size of salmon was small but enough for lunch if you need to get back to work. In my previous visits, I had tried their baby back rib that was tasty, too."
"1.0","Terrible service and a refused to deliver whenever I live 1 mile away?!? Also a Terribly long wait for average food. This Franks always messes up the food and the buffalo chicken pizza is just terrible here. Like how!?? There renowned for that... I suggest you go to the Franks in Milville it's 100 times better and they don't fck up your order. I will take my business elsewhere. I also suggest you looks elsewhere or go to the one in Millville."
"4.0","This is a great location in Mt. Washington, tucked back in the business district, off of the main overlook road.  It was a nice day, so the windows were open in the small restaurant.  They had a slushee stout, which tasted just like a mudslide, complete with fresh whipped topping.  The mussels were amazing with a tomato, garlic, chorizo sauce and the bread grilled perfectly for dipping.  I wanted more and bigger chunks of chorizo!  The fries were hot and crispy.  The wait staff was very friendly."
"5.0","Have ordered from this restaurant (through Wheel Deliver) many times but had never been to their 5th Ave location until last week for lunch.  Very pleasant atmosphere and a wonderful buffet.  An efficient and polite waiter kept our glasses filled with ice water.  It was a good experience which I hope to repeat soon."
"5.0","I LOVE THE YARD! I always get the 'Smack yo mama' which is a grilled cheese with pulled bbq chicken and beer cheese and fried onions. Its delicious if youre a fan of bbq. The atmosphere is great and im pretty sure they have half off on monday nights (?) not 100% sure but they definitely have half off one of the days. They also have good brunch and bottomless mimosas! 10/10 would recommend."
"5.0","This has been my family's favorite Chinese restaurant since I was a kid! Since as long as I can remember (late 1980, early 1990s?), the folks that own it and everyone who's managed it since then have been amazing! The atmosphere is chill, and it was the first place I went out to eat after I moved back to Pittsburgh. It's where I take (or get take-out for) friends from out of state when they visit. The food here is what I measure all other Chinese restaurants to, period. Praying for many continued years of delicious success!"
"4.0","This place is no frills, but the food is delicious. Must try the lemongrass tofu with rice! Downfall is cash only."
"5.0","The best Mediterranean food in Pittsburgh! The menu has a wide variety of options, and you can't go wrong with any selection. Highly recommend getting the Mezza Platter to start"
"5.0","Hands down--The best hoagies in town! No one, and I mean no one, has better hoagies!! I highly recommend The Wiz or The Phantom!!"
"1.0","The delivery guy was really rude when he showed up and provided over all poor customer service.  The pizza was horrible sauce running off .  I asked for extra cheese and its like they put stew sauce. Whatever was in the little clear cup was spilled and made the pizza soggy.  Overall I wouldn't recommend unless you want soggy wrong orders with horrible customer service"
"4.0","This is better than 4 stars but not quite 5.Many choices on the menu combined with generous portions and different flavors and reasonable prices make this a great everyday meal. This place is small and somewhat unkempt, so we go there for there for the food not the atmosphere.The Japanese eggplant stir fry with either duck or tofu is my favorite, but everything I have tasted is fine.BYOB"
"2.0","Wow! I don't know who these paid review writers are but there is no way that this place is worth five stars. Perhaps I visited on a bad night? Maybe. But I doubt it. A well trained staff will execute/deliver all the time no matter what. That place was ridiculous. Here's the breakdown of my experience:- overall appearance: 2.5 - 3- customer service: 3.5 - 4- food quality: 2- food presentation: 1.5 (sloppy with dirty utensils)- coffee: 1.5 (it almost tasted like coffee) Recommendations:- retrain the staff - teach them how to mop a floor without leaving it wet for customers to fall. - stop serving customers shit that you wouldn't accept. Sad."
"5.0","This place schmacks. Crispy and chewy naan, perfectly spiced dishes, and amazing gulab jamun. Very fair pricing + filling. Nice waiters. Offered us a free dessert."
"4.0","Was in Pitt just for the weekend, and if you're a French toast connoisseur/-euse like I am, I'd order it here. Not at all flimsy or soggy, three slices, done just right, impressively simple, just as French toast should be, and would order again for sure. Crowded on a Saturday morning, and even though they said the wait was twenty minutes, we were seated in two, and we were served our food just as unexpectedly quickly. Silver seal of approval :]."
"4.0","One of my favorite cafes with an outdoor seating area. The view of the adjacent gardens was beautiful. The staff was friendly and we were served our food quickly. I enjoyed the apple havarti panini with fruit salad. All the food is super fresh and flavorful."
"5.0","My daughter and I did lunch here last week.  I ordered a burger and she ordered a grilled cheese.  Both were great!  My burger was a little overdone but the taste more than made up for it.  The tatertots and the home-cut chips are wonderful!  I wish I could have tried some beer, but the next time I stop in, I will.  Yum!"
"4.0","this place is a party!!  amazing scene.  it's busy.  and great deals.  next time i'm back in pittsburgh: ALL BE BAAACK (Arnold)."
"5.0","So Jillian and I are reviewing it's amazing restaurant right on the strip district in Pittsburgh - Luke Wholeys Wild Alaskan Grill.  We talked it over and decided this was one of the best meals we've had stateside - outstanding!! We started off sharing a sushi roll with my sister from another mister, Kristen Hancock, her husband Luke and their little boy Wyatt - a roll they call the Kitchen Sink.  Yellowtail, spicy tuna, salmon and tuna - and it was fantastic!!  After that we all went into our zones and that's when amazing went into overdrive! Jillian had the ahi tuna, seared and topped with two kinds of tobego - one infused with lemon reduction that had her inhaling it. SHE LOVED IT!!!!!KRISTEN did the soft shell crab sandwich and Luke the shrimp Po-boy and everyone had smiles around the table a mile wide.  Im looking around checking out what the other tables were having - and the waiter made the decision easier for me:  I first decided to go with their Bloody Mary topped with spicy shrimp and maple bacon. It was so amazing I can barely type the rest of this review as my knees got totally week.  All of the olives, pickles and have of the maple bacon went to my co-reviewer -). After that I moved right onto the lobster bisque that was truly one of the best I ever had. Chunks of lobster crème fraîche perfectly mixed together into a fantastic warm soup on a beautiful spring afternoon.  But I wasn't done there.  Oh no, because on their menu they offer something called the steel city lobster roll - which is essentially an amazing lobster roll topped with their incredible lobster bisque as a bit of a gravy. So good, so good, so good!!!The service was fantastic, they even took care of my pups with water under the table and we all had a spectacular spectacular lunch!  Id fly back to Pittsburgh food just to eat their food.  We really enjoyed spending time with Luke himself the owner who returns out at one time lived on 89th and fifth - just a few blocks away from me in NYCBravo!!!"
"4.0","I've only been for the dinner buffet but it's been good enough that I've been several times, leaving each time fuller than the last. This buffet has a smaller selection than others I've been to but the quality and taste of the dishes is AWESOME. You even get your own basket of naan with the buffet price (which is very affordable). Service is dependable too!"
"4.0","This place never disappoints. The Pho is served on very large bowls (that is just the small).  The food has the same quality and taste and for some dishes even better taste than those trendy Vietnamese restaurants in NYC. The fresh veggie spring rolls are def the best way to kick off a meal. This is a small , family run place tucked away near children's hospital- but it is worth the trip."
"4.0","I am so happy to be able to write a good review for a locally-owned higher end restaurant.  I ate here last night with my boyfriend and thoroughly enjoyed my meal and experience.  When we walked in there was only one other table of guests there (which worries me somewhat) but I am going to start telling people to go there so hopefully that will change!I ordered the mushroom ravioli with caesar salad as my starter.  My boyfriend ordered the salmon with the beet salad as his starter.  We brought a bottle of wine and I was happy that our corkage fee was a reasonable price ($4).  We both really enjoyed our meals.  I also really liked our waitress, who was very attentive and friendly.  The atmosphere is fine: not great, but not bad.  I would say there were a few too many fake flowers for my liking but honestly it didn't overly detract from the dining experience. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal and will definitely be back again!  We just need to start getting more people here to ensure its success!"
"3.0","My friend picked this place to go for brunch when I was in town. She told me that they take online reservations an hour before we get there, and our reservation was for 12:05PM. I got there a little early and was approached by kind of a rude server. She wasn't rude per se, but she did seemed stressed with how many people were there. She told me I wasn't allowed to wait in there because there wasn't any room and basically kicked me out. I've never been to Lawrenceville, so I wasn't familiar with the area at all. It seems like a cool neighborhood though with a lot of outside shops. Unfortunately, it was snowing/raining so I really didn't want to be outside. Where was I supposed to go? I ended up just walking down the street to a chocolate place, but I was just annoyed. If it gets that busy, why not expand so you can add a waiting area for all your customers? Oh well. We ended up getting seated and to be honest, the food was just eh. I don't even remember what I got...I think it was the brunch burger. With all the hype it gets, it's not a very memorable place. It's definitely a cute little family, hipster restaurant, so I'd go back there to try it out again."
"2.0","Definitely the worst Indian lunch buffet I've had in Pittsburgh. Selection is very limited and the taste is bland. And nearly $10. Only good thing is close location to UPMC and Pitt. If you have time, walk down to India Garden on Atwood."
"5.0","This was my first time here. Had a party of 5 celebrating my wife's birthday. Upon arrival we got lucky and got a spot on Carson right out front. Because this is in the 2100 block it's away from the nakama madness of parking. Walked in the front door and was greeted by the hostess and was politely asked if we wanted to her to take our coats. How nice... Right!!! We had our table upstairs and had plenty of room. It was a Friday and we had made a reservation the night before for 7:30. No open table but a call was easy and had no problem getting a table on such short notice. Our server was awesome!! I don't say that often but he certainly knows the menu and more. He was prompt and followed up all the time. Not to mention head had all 4 tables upstairs. Meaning he was regularly running the steps. Kudos to him.I had a nice glass of Pinot noir. Loved it. Started with the mozzarella and it was awesome. This was plenty to share for 5 and prob could have easily served 6.The table shared the polenta and shrimp which was nice. Loved the polenta and table side service. I like the mini butcher clocks that they are served on. We also had the Brussel sprouts which were awesome with the polenta. My father had the Cesar salad which was perfectly dressed. Wife had the butternut squash soup which easily served 2 and our sever was nice enough to split the portion up. Soup was so hot which is the way it should be. I can't remember the last time I had soup this warm. Loved it!!!! I had the wild braised boar. Which by this time, I was getting full. But I couldn't let a bite go to waste. Finished it to the last bite and it was perfect.All other dishes were shared except mine which I wouldn't give up a bite. HahaOverall a perfect meal! Def will be back again. Thanks again to our server! He was magnificent!!!!!"
"5.0","Great place ! We went here for the first time and were not disappointed. The wines, cocktails, birch beer and Shirley Temple were absolutely amazing. The appetizers were great and the desserts really put a big finish. I recommend the mushroom risotto and the Quattro Fromaggio pizza. Loved it!"
"5.0","This is one of the best restaurants I've eaten at in a long time.  As a cook myself, I appreciate creativity in combining various flavors in a dish, and Morcilla does this expertly.  The ingredients were combined into an intoxicating fusion of flavor.  Everything we had was great, but I'd say the chorizo, the trout, and the ribs were our favorites.  Our waitress was super friendly and spent a good deal of time with us covering the menu and recommendations; she also gave us written recommendations of things to do in town.  They are gluten-conscious, and our waitress was very helpful in choosing GF menu items.     We happened to get a late seating on a Thursday night with a couple days notice, but I think weekends are booked out far in advance.  I so wish this restaurant was in my home town - it would be on our regular rotation.  We may have to travel to Pittsburgh again just to eat there!"
"5.0","I've always had a great experience here and it's one of my favorite places to eat in the city. Their vegetarian dishes, though limited, are superb."
"5.0","BullDawg's came to a community event in my town. They had a few different options of hamburgers or hotdogs. We ordered the bbq burgers, that came with good hand cut fries. And philly steaks that also came with fries. $11 per meal was not bad. It took about 10-15 for out food to get done, no big deal because it was fresh! I did not eat the philly steak but the burger and fries were delicious. I'd definitely order from this food truck again."
"5.0","Absolutely the best Peruvian food in Pittsburgh. I don't live here anymore but when I return, I eat here several times. Food is super fresh, the specials are to die for and their empanadas make me smile. They buy genuine Peruvian goods to sell as well in their gift shop section."
"2.0","Warning: This place doesn't have a full bar. There are beers, naturally, four cocktails, and Arsenal cider (yum!). The menu isn't large, and the options traditional with a twist. Three of us got the pastrami sandwich, but it didn't taste like pastrami - not what we were expecting at all. The fries are delicious, though. There was only one desert option, which was a pop tart with foie gras icing on top. Eew. Basically I only liked the cider and fries. I hope the new location (former Spaghetti Warehouse) will have a larger and more traditional menu."
"5.0","I had the 22 oz porterhouse steak and every pc was so perfectly done throughput from first bite to last. Literally every bite I shook my head and said how good it was. Also got the lobster mac. Very rich and enough for 2Extremely attentive wait staff kept us filled with drinks and bread on the table. Well done"
"1.0","The absolute worst dining experience of my life, the service was terrible from the start. After waiting several minutes with no one approaching to take our order, my husband assumed that we had to go to the coffee counter to order, only to be told that they will come to us to take our order. I ordered a side of bacon with a crepe, and my bacon was literally so black that it was inedible. After asking to have it removed from our check, and advising that I didn't want to have it re-made, we finished our meals. Upon receiving the check, I handed over my debit card only to find that it was rung up for a completely different total. When I asked why I was then told that they forgot to charge us for the water on the original check. I understand if they charge for water, but that should have been disclosed at some point prior to ringing my card for a completely different total than what I was advised when I handed over my card. On top of all of that, the food was mediocre at best. I will never spend money here ever again. All of that being said, I did tip the server 20% as I believe that service workers should be paid fairly, even when poor service is provided such as in this case."
"1.0","Not fresh at all I don't know why, but the restaurant delivered really bad food to our table. The other tables have fresh sushi, sashimi, etc."
"3.0","As Munch the food critic says, this is the place to go if you are very hungry and need that immediate taco fix.  The food is so cheap at 3 dollars a taco, that almost anything would be acceptable at that price point.  I was there around dinner time and it was a lively, fun atmosphere(the chef provides jokes to go with his cuisine, he called up my order in a funnyway) and the food comes at you quicker than a freight train.   The ingredient portions are more than adequate which makes the price point better than average.  The ingredients also seem fresh, but for some reason one of my taco's seemed a bit bland.  I got the vegan taco and the pollo taco.  The vegan seemed to have a bit more flavor, but the chicken was a bit bland and had a slightly fishy taste.  I have no idea where that came from.  I honestly think this place is the first of it's kind in Pittsburgh.  I don't know anywhere else where you can get a taco this fast that's this cheap and that is not from a food truck. For that reason alone I will most likely go back more than a few times.  It definitely filled me up for 8 dollars total including a Jarrito's Guava flavored soda.  I had never had the guava kind which was really wonderful."
"3.0","The only reason I really go here is when I'm on my boat and get hungry, and this is one of the few boat-up bar/restaurants in the city.  The complete lack of boat+drink+food spots in this city should be the subject of another post.  Although this place has a lot of potential, the beer list is lacking and comparatively expensive.  The food is mediocre generally, though I did get a pretty decent fish sandwich last time I was here.  I've had several of their apps, and none of them were worth writing home about.  Come here if you're looking for a 'chill' environment, good patio dining, and a nice view of the river.  If you're only looking for a good meal, I definitely don't recommend it."
"4.0","I was impressed with this place. Nicely done decor. Server was excellent, very friendly and attentive. My first thought was that the prices were high for a cheese sandwich, but I changed my mind when it came...they are HUGE and packed with toppings. I got the 'Big Chebowski' which had cheddar, smoked gouda, bacon, and a fried egg. It was delicious and huge, I barely finished it. They are VERY greasy between the huge amount of cheese and the buttered bread, so beware! I also upgraded the soup to a mac and cheese, and I'll say theirs is probably the best mac and cheese I've had in this city. I'd come in just for that! The fries served with the sandwich are very good, but I'd say they are too heavy for these decadent sandwiches; I might have preferred something like a shoestring fry with this meal.Criticisms...the menu is way too big. I'd rather see a handful of their best selections and maybe a couple daily or weekly specials items. The menu includes snacks, appetizers, and sides which seems like a bit much. And salads. (Who comes to places like this and gets a salad???) My husband had the tomato soup with his sandwich and he said it was nothing special. I'm also very surprised they don't have a 'build your own' option.All in all the food and service were excellent and I'll definitely be back in soon."
"1.0","Went here on Friday for lunch. Not a bad wait for market square. Only 15 mins for. Party of 5.Service was poor and we got our food before we got our waters and drinksFood was not so good. They even forgot one persons food and we finished before he got his food. This is basic Mexican food and nothing to rave about. Won't be back again."
"1.0","The location is so perfect. And I have been here multiple times and had mediocre experiences where the location made up for the other parts of the experience. Unfortunately, the experience I had there yesterday was so bad that I will never be back. We were there for a family birthday dinner, and it was like they went out of their way to ensure our celebration did not go as planned. There is a lot wrong to discuss here, but I will name only a few:1. We were all there to celebrate with all you can eat crab legs.This is advertised on their website for $39, it is in fact $45. Not a big deal, but c'mon.2. They insisted on seating us, including my elderly grandma, in the beating sun. We tolerated it for a bit, but once my friend arrived with her baby...sitting in the sun just wasn't an option...for obvious reasons. So we asked to be moved. We completely understand that  this isn't the easiest thing to do, but we spent $550! I think we deserved to be comfortable (and our elderly and baby safe). The (one server) staff was horrendous about it. Like really terrible. I can name on one hand the times a server has treated me that poorly.3. We had a party of 8, so we undersandly had to have one check. No big deal. However, we were required to split the check equally or not at all. So there was no way for us to gift my aunt her meal. It was either cover the whole thing or split it amongst ourselves evenly. Like what?! Unless their POS system is ancient, this makes no sense.I could list additional items, but I feel that's enough for this review. As I said, never going back."
"5.0","A co-worker has been wanting to try out this place for awhile and we were finally able to today. We got the vegetable Momo, pan fry momo, 3 Nepali dishes (Lamb, Pork, and Chicken), and vegetable biryani to go. Everything was truly delicious, I highly recommend the pan fried momo, I would have been happy to just have those alone. Plenty of food for the prices. I would highly recommend this place for their food, we will definitely be ordering for lunch from here again."
"5.0","Sausalido is a well kept secret on the main strip through Bloomfield. It doesn't get the attention of the new and trendy places opening up in the area, but is easily the equal. The food is rich and flavorful. On recent trips I have had the Duck Breast, Crab Cakes and Squash Lasagne. Each was cooked perfectly, and the portions were very large. Also, you get a very rustic serving of bread with a white bean, gouda and balsamic dip. This is insanely addictive, You could almost eat that as a meal itself. The staff could not be more friendly. Cheerful, attentive and talkative, It's almost like having a family meal. The real gem here though is Chef Mike Smith. He is as affable as he is talented. He makes it a point to come out of the kitchen and talk and greet his guests. The place is BYOB, which is fine, though the corking fee seems a bit excessive. Otherwise, I've had nothing but extremely positive experiences here."
"5.0","Very very tasty! I went for the lunch buffet (only $10!) and was pleasantly surprised by almost all vegetarian options. The daal and okra were particularly tasty, and they had a mango drink that was out-of-this-world delicious. I wish they labeled things as explicitly vegetarian/vegan, because we had to ask about some things. Also, I wish there were a salad bar like at most Indian buffets I've been to- there weren't any vegetables that weren't deep fried. The inside was clean and the staff very attentive- thanks for a great lunch!"
"4.0","After a meal with some friends, we were looking for a place to chill that wasn't very noisy to catch up. We wandered into Station and knew it was the perfect place! Staff was friendly and the atmosphere was a exactly what we needed. I was actually surprised how laid back it was for a Saturday night in Bloomfield (me, two friends and Ankur three or four people at the bar). The place itself have a very modern and rustic look that you see a lot of these, but it makes the place more comforting and warm. We didn't order food, just drinks. Glass of wine was around $8 which is average. I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking to hang out for an hour or so without a crazy crowd and noise."
"2.0","One would assume the Oysters would be decent at the 'Original Oyster House'. I highly recommended they change their name. Oysters were awful!Great clam chowder though. :)"
"5.0","My fiancé and I were there on a Saturday afternoon recently for our first visit.  We loved it and are looking forward to going back and ordering something new! We did have to wait a short time in line, but we didn't care, which is unusual for us. We were just excited to be there, and the vibe in the place is very good! We wanted to order most things on the menu, but settled on lattes and wraps. She the tofu scramble, and I got a Seitan 'steak' like wrap.  We enjoyed and shared both, and only finished half of each.  The tofu scramble had a hint of spicy flavor, and everything blended together well, I didn't want to give it back to her, even though my wrap was like a 'steak um'. Very enjoyable. Loved the whole vibe of the place, its tight in there which we also don't usually like, but in here it didn't matter.  Lots of fun, and I am still full hours later as I write this review! We will be BACK! We have already told others about this GEM! VEGAN NATION!"
"5.0","This is probably one of the very few good bakeries in Pittsburgh. I got the chocolate croissant which was the right amount of flaky, crunchy, and softness. I also really liked the dark chocolate and buttery flavor that was not overwhelmingly greasy like some other croissants can be. I also got the apple tarte which was good, but just average. When I was here the almond croissant looked a bit flat for a croissant which is why I decided not to get it. But after reading some of the other reviews on here, I'll be trying it out next time!"
"3.0","I went to Sausalido with a friend on a Groupon. It was a Tues evening and the restaurant was not busy. We received great attentive service from our server. Our appetizer (goat cheese portabella), salad, and bread with the hummus dip were all great. We ordered the roasted seafood risotto special and that's where Sausalido lost a few points. The dish was quite bland with little substance in terms of seasoning. When my friend and I had our first bite, we both reached for the salt shaker. I will definitely give Sausalido another try, but will go for a different main dish."
"5.0","I needed this, so so so badly!!!  Pure pleasure awaits, just pick your fix.  Sandwich soup dessert coffee it's all premium...  I need more"
"5.0","Wow, wow, wow!  I have tried crepes, I have tried pancakes, but this was my very first experience with hot cakes. Both crispy and soft at the same time, huge in size, they make for an amazing breakfast. What a treat!  I ordered my with strawberries. My taste buds were pleasantly surprised by extra sugar and cinnamon added inside. Beautiful perfectly cooked combination. We came in on a Monday and we happy to be able to find sits right away. Our previous attempt the day before (Sunday) was not nearly as successful as the wait was 40 to 50 min long and we choice to eat elsewhere. I'm glad we made this trip back and tried the hot cakes. Restaurant also had a sign 'cash only' by the entrance. Not sure if they normally don't take cards or if it was a one time event, in any case it might be a problem for some customers and I recommend double checking prior to dining there of cash is an issue."
"4.0","We've been here on several occasions, and the service is either great or so-so (never bad), but one thing is consistent: The 'Over 9,000 roll' is absolutely EPIC.Ever since we first tried this place, we always order the Over 9000 roll. Not just because it's REALLY FUN TO SAY. One of us ordered it that first visit, and now we can't stop in without getting it. Also noteworthy: The Shrimp Po Boy is a great comfort food option. Generously shrimped (I know that's not a real verb, nonetheless) and perfectly piled up with fresh toppings. Same goes for the Lobster Bisque Fries: Comfort Food for your inner Beach Bum.Any seafood you get here is delightfully fresh tasting and so perfect in texture... They always just blow the preparation out of the water! (Ha)Definitely a great go-to for a trip to the Strip!"
"3.0","The Korean fried chicken are so delicious, however, they're pretty pricey. They could get away with it since they're the only place selling KFC in PGH. They recently started selling bingsoo, mmmm in a big fan and it is perfect for those hot summer days! But again the price is higher than what I'll normally pay. I'll definitely come more often if the price is lower. Overall, the food here is phenomenal, price is high for these Asian street food."
"5.0","I was incredibly surprised by Pamela's.  I thought the food was good (and unique!), the service was great, and the price wasn't too rough.  I went on a Wednesday morning, and it was relatively empty, but I'm aware it gets insanely crowded on the weekends so you'd have to plan ahead.  Definitely going to stop here again with my parents :)"
"5.0","Absolutely nothing better!Saturday in Shady Side....the sun is out and lunch with Pie"
"5.0","Great food and drinks. Unique appetizers. Tried the Rabbit Rillette, Deviled eggs, and the spinach feta dip. Our group all agree, delicious!! We Love the environment."
"5.0","Buca di FUCKING Beppo. My guy. This place is by far my new favorite restaurant in all of Pittsburgh. The food was just VERY exquisite. I'm so convinced that they just put some type of drug in the food which makes it so good. I really couldn't stop eating yet I will be going home with some leftovers. & wOW OUR SERVER! He was the best server. We talked about lizards and saving the turtles. Thank you Buca for changing my life"
"4.0","I think I need to mention off the bat that the menu here is small. Guys, that's a good thing. Seriously, restaurants with overwhelming menus just cause confusion and longer waits at times. When there's a concentrated menu food seems to be more fresh and on point.There are taco specials that change and that's a nice little surprise when you're in the mood for something different.The interior is small and not good for large groups. I've eaten here once and other times just order takeaway.$3 tacos can't be beat! Definitely in my top ten for local tacos."
"4.0","I had a wonderful experience at this restaurant bringing 8 out of town guests from across the country. The food was outstanding and the wait staff is very accommodating. Alex made a special effort to make sure our time there was enjoyable. Good authentic Italian cuisine at a very reasonable price."
"5.0","Best food truck on Bigelow. Perhaps the best food truck in Pittsburgh (sorry Franktuary Truck, but the truth hurts sometimes). Good portions, great flavor, and you can even call ahead and avoid waiting for your food to be freshly cooking before your eyes. Lamb Biryani with spice level 8 and a samosa = pure heaven for $6 total.Oh, and that Indian food truck located two trucks to the front of India on Wheels with the same exact menu? AVOID IT AT ALL COST. Unless you enjoy an afternoon of tums, pepto bismol, and gastrointestinal issues - then by all means, live your life to the max."
"5.0","This place is incredible! The whole atmosphere is relaxed and refined I've sat at the bar and a table before and the service at both are great! Ive tried several menu items and have been exceptionally pleased with everything I've eaten. The menu is so diverse and includes street foods from around the world! Definitely recommend the steamed buns, a special they have now added to the menu. Also, Dan the bartender is awesome!"
"1.0","Worst experience I've ever had. The host was incredibly rude. We asked what the wait time was for a party of 4. They took one look at us and first said 'It's a long wait,'and then the other host said 'like, an hour.' They were so mean to us based on what we looked like. I am so disappointed in this experience based on the fact the Redbeard's on The Incline was so nice."
"5.0","No more brunch! However, dinner is still exceptional! My husband I checked out the winter menu this past weekend. Wild boar, pork with figs, oh my! Tasty and warm! The food simply great!"
"4.0","I've been here twice so far.The overall ambience and vibe of this place is really great. I felt very comfortable in here. I know that's a weird thing to say, but it just felt good to be inside this place. A very warm feeling.I've tried a few things off the menu and each item was pretty yummy. The food here in my opinion is consistently good. I've had nothing fantastic or must try yet, but I've also tried a limited portion of the menu. I'll be sure to keep sampling. The price of the food is about what you'd expect. Portions are smaller though so this is a place where you should definitely try an appetizer or two in addition to the main course. I think my favorite thing about this place so far is the cocktails. The bartenders are awesome. The drinks alone will keep me coming back. On my last trip we just sat at the bar and talked with the bartender for a few hours. I tried one cocktail here - I forget what the exact name was - but it was a take on an old fashioned, but had a banana walnut taste to it. Unbelievable. Really Really good.  As a Bloomfield resident, I'm super excited a place like this opened up in the neighborhood. Hats off to the owner for taking a gamble on this one. I hope this place is around for awhile."
"2.0","The owners of this place must be idiotic and computer illiterate.  It boggles my mind how so many bad reviews can be received for years on end with no changes made.  The amount of money they are losing by being disorganized must be staggering.It is only worth going if you ride your bike to Washington's Landing and want a drink.  Otherwise you may request a table and be told that it is a 30 minute wait while 20 tables sit empty.  Those 20 tables, by the way, will continue to remain empty while you wait for one.  Parties that just arrive will seat themselves and be served, or will get immediately seated.  The bar is always surrounded by groups waiting with table-buzzers that are looking around perplexed at all of the empty tables.  I ordered food and the shrimp was still frozen.  Straight out of a precooked frozen bag from CostCo, I presume.  They have a good location and are abusing it.  This is a poorly run business that could be turned into something great.  From the reviews I've seen, I guess this is how it has always been.  What an incredible travesty."
"3.0","Do not get the Grown up Grilled cheese,it barely had enough cheese to hold the two pc of bread together, way over priced at $14.00.My husband did like his chicken sandwich. The service was friendly."
"4.0","I went during their soft opening, so the menu was still limited. I'm hoping to try some of their other menu options after their grand opening at the end of august.The chicken is double fried and is delicious.  You can choose from wings, drumsticks, or a combination of both and choose from a sweet and sour or a soy garlic sauce. The wings and drumsticks were a good size and I had the sweet and spicy sauce, which was very tasty, but made a bit of a sticky mess (be sure to ask for a few extra napkins).  They will spice up the sweet and sour sauce, so be sure to ask for that if you like it hot. It sits a bit heavy, so I found that the snack size was perfect for one person.  It does take a few minutes for them to prepare the chicken. So be prepared to wait a few, but it's worth the wait.The bubble milk tea was some of the tastiest I've had. The tapioca bubbles are prepared fresh every couple of hours and the tea was very flavorful.  They made the tea quickly, so I was able hang out and sip it while they finished up my chicken. The bubble tea cups even have a sealed top in case you're trying to carry a bunch of them at once, no leaking possible.  This is important, because this is mostly a take out joint.  There are only a couple tables inside, but when the weather is nice, there are lots of good places to sit outside and eat within a block of the restaurant."
"1.0","Just moved from TX to Pittsburgh and I'd been craving some good Mexican food. I finished up some light shopping in the area and decided to give Qdoba a shot...big mistake! I'd never eaten at a Qdoba before this incident and most likely never will. I did not know it was cafeteria style food but decided to try them out anyway...hey you never know right? Unfamiliar with their menu I go with the craft two, quesadilla and nachos. The cheese quesadilla was ok but the nachos were luke warm at best! Who sells luke warm queso on nachos? I politely asked the manager if my food could be reheated and I was given was a whole lot of attitude! I was there by myself and the manager did a really good job of embarrassing me and making me feel un-welcome. She was very argumentative, rude, and combative. All I wanted was hot food, I swear. I'm an easy going person and I understand how it is working in guest service but I don't condone or tolerate being rude to others! It's not necessary. But what blows my mind is that SHE IS THE MANAGER!!! Really?  She kept saying I'm sorry I can't heat up your food. I said can I just please have hot queso. So she puts some cheese in a ramican and hands it to me. No, I aplologize let me make it right or anything. Instead she made it seem like it was my fault and how dare I expect to get my money's worth! I sat down and called a friend in NYC describing my experience. I didn't even want to eat anymore. She just humiliated me in front of others! I went up to her letting her know how I felt and she still wouldn't listen. She just kept talking over me and continuing to be rude to me. I had to call corporate. They listened and offered coupons to give them another shot but honestly I'm not ever going back to a Qdoba again because of this location! The Caucasian manager with the chubby face, long kookaid red hair with the nose ring ruined my experience! Thanks a lot! Word of advice customers don't expect to get cold food...they expect for it to be hot and if it's not the customer expects for you to be apologetic and to offer to make it right! No exceptions!!! There's no excuse for bad service ever!!! I wish I could rate it zero stars!! Don't eat here!! You've been warned!!"
"5.0","We had a great lunch. Lobster bisque is the best in the city. My lunch was a lobster roll steel city style. My wife enjoyed crabcakes salad. You can't beat this place if you like fresh seafood."
"1.0","Forgot my ranch two times!!! Wouldn't respond back when I wrote them..... Been six months since I ordered from them and they obviously do not care about getting back with customers. Disappointing"
"3.0","Unfortunately, I got an sloppy and inattentive waiter. I guess his thoughtlessness can be attributed to his seemingly young age. Other than that the venue seems laid back and comfortable. Great beer selection and, if you seat al fresco, you get a nice view of the Market Square and its nice cobblestone streets."
"4.0","I used to come here every Wednesday night in college for the $3 goblets of Miller Lite. My how the times have changed. I didn't know what to expect for a weekday lunch but I was really pleasantly surprised at the food and service! Came for lunch around 11:30 on a Thursday and apart from one other twosome, we had the place to ourselves. Service was very prompt with our waitress approaching us immediately and getting our drinks in a pinch. I chose the Santa Fe chicken sandwich and my companion had the steak salad. The sandwich was HUGE and half of it was more than enough for the meal. The flavor was really tasty with a little bit of heat but nothing crazy. For my side, I had the sweet potato fries. They were amazing!!! Crinkle cut with just a little char and some type of cinnamon sugar dusting which I'm sure put the nutritional value at a negative 5 but tasted phenomenal!! The salad was large and looked really good as well and was served with a delicious looking piece of garlic bread. I was impressed. Good food, good service and the price is right. I'll be back for sure!"
"5.0","Wow! I am not vegan nor vegetarian and, just wow. I was incredibly impressed with the food and atmosphere here. Starting with the staff, they were so helpful and attentive.. you could tell they were very genuine. As BYOB, they were very friendly and brought us everything we needed. The food was incredibly flavorful and delicious. We went for a Saturday brunch and got right in - we sat at their gorgeous artistic table by the window. We pretty much ordered everything on the menu and we're nothing short of impressed. My favorite was the McMaiden sandwich - it was so flavorful you would never tell it was vegan. And I am still dreaming about the kale salad and crispy potatoes. We tried a few of their donuts as well and wow. I can't get over how amazing they were - the unique flavors, especially the pandan filling was to die for. We also ordered a box of their 'eddies' twinkies to go because they just were so great but we were way too full. We will absolutely be back... what a hidden gem."
"5.0","Food was flavorful, well cooked, and authentic.  I really enjoyed my meal and I will definitely come back the next time I'm in Phg."
"4.0","Great topping choices, and they let you really load them up! Service could be a little friendlier, but it may have been an off day."
"4.0","It isn't a dive.  But it isn't fancy.  It... well, it's ... a bar.  We've been there a few times now and I haven't really had anything I didn't like, although there were a few things that stood out more than others...  Firstly, we were pretty disappointed with the Nachos.  They weren't bad, but the portion was really small and the toppings weren't distributed very well.  Instead of the nachos, try the porky fries -- they are DELICIOUS!  We were a bit skeptical at first, but hubby and I fell in love with the mix of cheese and the pulled pork.We've had numerous sandwiches (all good, the HBLT is HUGE and so yummy!), burgers, and daily specials and the food is pretty good.  Tuesdays they have tacos for $1 each and they do a good job of loading up on the meat and toppings.  They rarely have beer specials (at least on a regular weeknight when we're most apt to go), but the beer isn't too expensive to begin with so...The waitresses are nice and we've had the cook come out a few times to make sure we liked our food.  Overall a nice place!Quick tip: If you're... anything other than skinny, you might find it a bit uncomfortable getting into/out of the booths in the main bar area, but they are comfy to sit in once you ARE in."
"4.0","Stopped by Cafe Mona with a friend of mine this week and were pleasantly impressed with another new bistro.  The interior is eclectic and kind of reminds you of being on vacation somewhere else.  The outdoor seating in the rear is as pleasant as it gets.  Vibrant and colorful and quite airy.  My friend had the chicken pesto salad which looked incredibly fresh and attractively constructed.  I had the Cheese steak crepe which I wanted to try just out of curiosity.  The flavor was exact but the crepe made the dish a whole new experience.  A good part of the menu is crepes and I wast to try many more.  The staff were friendly, courteous and attentive.  But most of all...they smiled and seemed honestly glad to see you.  Quite friendly and gracious."
"5.0","Great food and awesome service. The ambiance is also amazing and it is a fun place to go! The pumpkin risotto, salads, and cheese plates were all so delicious. Will definitely be back!"
"5.0","Finally made it to this much heralded café in the Bloomfield section of the city. Delicious freshly prepared food and coffee drinks. Pleasant, efficient service as well!"
"4.0","So far, I have eaten here twice and came in for drinks one other time. I have to admit I've only had one entree because I am absolutely obsessed with it. But first, the ambiance: very trendy without being overly pretentious. I love that. You walk in and you know it's a cool place but Bloomfield is filled with and array of people and this place has that. The service: every time I've been here our servers were awesome and helpful and knowledgeable. The food: the most important part! I will say I think it's a little pricey. Which is probably why I won't give 5 stars. I don't really expect $25-$30 entrees in a place like this, but the majority are. But not the station burger ($16). This is seriously one of the best burgers I've had. They cook it to perfection every time. Lately I've been to a lot of places that don't understand what MEDIUM means and it's always over cooked. But both times here it's been perfect. From the Asiago fondue topping to the jam, it's seriously incredible. This time we also has the roasted carrots and the Chicken liver mousse. I absolutely recommend the chicken liver mousse. I've never had chicken liver before so I was just going out on a limb but it was awesome! Its definitely a good date place or a good gathering place for friends. Check it out!"
"5.0","My rating is a 4.5 that gets rounded up to a 5.  You will definitely not be impressed with the cafeteria style atmosphere, but it is comfortable and you are there for the food, not the decor.Speaking of food, you get a ton of it for a great price.  The 2 curry, rice and vegetable combo is my favorite way to go.  I've had enough food to either indulge myself in one sitting and not have to eat another meal the rest of the day, or eat half, and then finish the rest as another meal later in the day - pick your poison.The best thing in my opinion is the chili chicken.  The beef and chicken samosas are delectable and the wraps are delicious too.The people working there were pretty nice as well.  Sometimes, they run out of a certain popular item and need to make a new batch, but they will bring it to your table as soon as it's ready to go.Shame I only found out about this place during my last few months in Pittsburgh, or else I can see myself eating here at least once a week on the regular."
"5.0","The best authentic Mediterranean food you will ever have!  Spectacular!!  Everything was delicious.  I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely be back."
"1.0","WHAT is going on with RC!  Went to lunch, menu completed changed - for the worse.  They no longer make their own burgers (I know), and they removed my favorite salads, and lunch entrees are pretty much non-existent unless you want to pay $50 for a lunch (oh, and no subs, or spend another $5.00 for half-order of whatever). I am so disappointed :(  Used to be a great place.  We were told all corporate changes due to FDA, I just don't know about that.  Lunch crowd will be minimal if none."
"5.0","Some of the best seafood that I have had in a while. Their batter and fryer are awesome and I would recommend it to anyone. Good and friendly service"
"4.0","I couldn't find the restaurant at first because there's no clear sign outside - but mama didn't raise a quitter so I channeled my inner Sherlock and found the stairs leading to Umami. The menu is Japanese street food inspired - we had a bunch of robatayaki (yakitori style skewers of grilled fare), a grilled whole branzino, and the sashimi plate. The highlights were the pork belly skewer and the branzino, but the sashimi was also super fresh and the scottish salmon skewer was also delicious!! We had to back for round two on the port belly skewers because DAMN they are YUMami. Downside was we got dripped on by the vents above us but I can look past that for a tasty meal!"
"2.0","We wanted try this place due to the Bettis factor and seating by the water. The view was nice and there was no wait on a Friday night at 630pm. The waitress was nice and attentive. We had the pretzel breadsticks, beer, and mixed drink. The food was hot and fresh. I thought $9.50 for a small Jack/Coke was bit much. The biggest concern that I had with the experience was the men's restroom. There was a one way window while standing at the urinal that allowed you to watch the bar area, but people obviously couldn't see in. Seriously?.. what's the purpose?.. I wasn't impressed."
"4.0","If your looking for greasy junk food pizza this is the place. Every time I've had the pizza here it's been good. A few beers or whiskeys and this pizza will hit the spot."
"4.0","We came here around 1pm on a Sunday and the place was empty. After Having traipsed around Larryville looking for a spot that actually served lunch and not brunch, we were happy  to stumble upon this place. The service was lovely! We had a very friendly waitress who was super attentive and helpful with any questions we had. I got the Canadian Waffle drink, which secretly consisted of a two drink system comprised of a crown royal maple & lemon cocktail served with a Woodchuck Cider. Not. Too. Shabby. Yes, it did sort of taste like waffles.We had the pretzel app the start with and they were just okay. My Pittsburgh steak salad was everything I'd hope it would be and more. The bed of greens it was served on was surprisingly sophisticated for a dive bar. All sorts of fresh chopped up veggies and such. Very big, very good  and priced just right. I've heard many things about this place for it's night life, so I'll be sure to stop in sometime for karaoke or something."
"1.0","My boyfriend and I decided to check Coca Cafe because it was recommended by locals. After searching on Yelp for customer reviews as well as food (I mean duh who doesn't do that) we thought it would be a great place to visit. We arrived at 5 minutes after nine and were promptly seated. It took 15-20 minutes before our waitress came to the table. We were a little confused considering the restaurant opened at 9 and they were not super busy. After she finally came to the table she gave one menu. It took another 10 minutes for her to come back and we ordered our food and drinks. After waiting for a total of one hour we asked how much longer? She responded I don't know. We replied can you check? She said sure. After she came back she said there were 5 tables ahead of us and she had no idea how long it was going to take because they were large parties. We responded ok well 30 minutes and hour? She replied I don't know. We asked for the check because we were hangry af! When we got the bill they charged for our food and drink even though they hadn't even started making our food. My boyfriend said ummmm we aren't paying for the food. Then another lady came over and said we are really busy on Saturday and Sunday and we have a small kitchen. Moreover, we can only handle two orders at a time. We said ok well we want to leave. After we checked out we realized the people that walked in with us were leaving as well but they had already ate. Would never go back again. Consider expanding your kitchen or getting chefs that can cook faster."
"4.0","The chicken was tasty but the pearl milk tea didn't taste very good. The pearls were hard and the drink was over sweetened. Price is about average for Korean fried chicken. The shop itself was empty when I picked up my food but the parking outside is horrendous. Worth a try but I probably won't be back."
"4.0","Went to this place to see just how big the pizzas are after hearing about it. Its true they are HUGE. They're $30 and topping I think was 5? They only make one size so I hope you're hungry. The pizza was good but nothing special. Just a giant classic cardboard pizza."
"4.0","Nice downtown lunch spot. I had my favorite, pastor tacos with rice and retried beans. $12. It's nice to enjoy lunch while looking out the windows over Station Square."
"3.0","I've been here several times for lunch and after-work drinks with friends, and I usually suggest it for the latter because it's the earliest starting Happy Hour of any downtown restaurant/bar that I know of.  (4pm as of the time of this writing.)  It's spacious, well lit by the skylights above, and has a decent patio with a direct view of Market Square.  Service has always fine to me, and if you enjoy beer, this is the place for you because at any given time they have several dozen on tap.  Most of the good craft brews aren't on the HH special, though, so be sure to ask your server before you make any assumptions.  The fried pickle appetizer is a crowd-pleaser. It's a solid up-level sports bar."
"4.0","This was my second time to the Yard and I am still a major fan of it. It is a fun, hip place to go if you are in the mood for a grilled cheese. And let me tell you, these grilled cheeses are not your typical one that you probably had when you were growing up. These are gourmet and beautiful and delicious. I had the Buffy the Mac Attack Slayer. Ugh. Simply amazing. If you like Mac n Cheese AND buffalo chicken dip you just have to try this one out. Honestly so good!! For an appetizer, I got the pub pretzels and those are equally as delicious. You only get four, so if you're sharing, just beware! Unfortunately, the only 'bad' thing about this restaurant is the wait time for food. The first time I went, I had to wait nearly an hour for my food to come out and today I had to wait about 30-35 minutes for it. Bit annoying when you're starving! But the food is good, so it's worth the wait!"
"3.0","So after visiting on a few occasions I have visited this carefully crafted pseudo Mexican restaurant I am ready to weigh in on it's qualities.First let's start on the critiques, having come from the West Coast I am intimately familiar with the awesomeness of authentic spot on Mexican food. Las Velas attempts to meet this authenticity but it all seems disingenuous and forced. They are trying to capture the feel  but instead it feels like a hipsters view of a bar in Puerto Vallarta. That's it the only 'negative' I can find. Now let's rock the good stuff!Their house margarita is ROCK SOLID!!! Two of their tall house margarita's had me with that warm fuzzy feeling in my tummy! Great when only having two and I'm no lightweight! The burrito's are done in the wet burrito style which makes for a great burrito but last time there was no question what kind of meat I wanted just delivery of my ordered burrito and NO MEAT! Good burrito but felt unfulfilled without good meat in the middle.The good is solid Mexican fare but nothing jumps out at me as a WOW except that killer house Margarita! If you're looking for solid food with killer margarita's then this is your stop! Trust me living DAHN TAHN I'll be back!!!"
"2.0","I never write a review until I leave but this place has me a bit upset. When I walk in the guy say you should sit at the bar but oh you can sit anywhere but the bar is best. Ok I take it I need to sit at the bar. So I order food. Just 10 wings. They bring me only 9. Yep I'm at bit pissed off. I pay for 10 I'd like to have 10. If I ever return to Pittsburg I don't think I'd come back. Service is like 90 percent of the dining experience. When I told my bartender she just blew it off. I guess because they are by the baseball field they can do whatever! I'm so not happy! I also order tequilla Dobel $15 when I have gotten it for $4. Stick to beer. $3.75-7.00For those who care or dare to try-maybe you'll have a better experience than me-the wings are good, all 9 if them."
"5.0","Streets on Carson is the best restaurant in Southside, hands down. Food and drinks are INCREDIBLE. The owners are so kind and you feel so welcomed from the second you walk into their restaurant. Our waiter told us that the owners have worked every single day since they opened (the wife is about to have a baby too and that hasn't even slowed her down - she was inspiring!). If you are looking for a great atmosphere, great food, great drinks, and great people, look no further than Streets on Carson."
"5.0","First time at Grille 36 and the food was great and a great place to watch sports. Our server George gave us plenty of great recommendations and was a great server! I'll definitely be coming back to this place for food and drinks!"
"4.0","Yeah, this place is it for lunch during the week.  The place is very small, so if you're wanting to eat in, try to get there a bit early to grab a table.The staff is super friendly. They are helpful and patient.  The Italian Regular is great.  I usually get it grilled and their dressing is awesome.  They have a great deal for lunch during the week.  6 inch sub with a soda for about $8.  Yum."
"3.0","It is a good place for brunch. I had one of the Mac n' Cheese options and substituted with sweet potatoes fries. I am personally not impressed but the food was good and I would probably come back if people would like to come here. The Mac n' Cheese bites are cheesy and I wish there was more macaroni instead of so much cheese. I feel super full... they also have a blood Mary bar and brunch on Sundays are from 11 am to 4 pm."
"1.0","Really bad coffee for one. It reminds me of gas station coffee. I came here with my sister and mom, my sisters challah French toast was thinly sliced which is of course not how to make challah French toast (it was soggy and gross). My meal came with toast and had to hunt down a server to get butter then had to wait five minutes to get butter with no apology or excuse from the server. Then I turned the toast over and noticed it was burnt to a crisp and inedible. Because our server was so hard to get a hold of, I knew if I tried to get new toast my omelette would be cold by the time I would get it. I added avocado to my omelette and it was literally brown--very old. Why do they think it's ok to serve that?? Very meh, bad service and chefs that think it's ok to serve inedible food."
"5.0","This is a great little lunch time gem downtown. My coworkers and I went looking for a bargain lunch downtown. For $10, you got to choose 2 food items and a beverage. I went with 1 arepa and 1 empanada. I still can't tell which one I liked more, both were great. If you're unfamiliar with the food the very friendly gentleman at the register passionately explains what an arepa is and what is best to suit your tastes. The staff is very very friendly, and the little sauces they make to go with the food are fantastic.Be aware that this place does not have sit down tables and chairs, but more tall tables and a counter that you lean and eat at. They of course do to-go orders as well. This is worth a try if you're an adventurous eater!"
"5.0","Quite possibly the best steak I've ever had. The service is outstanding and though some may find it expensive, the quality of the food makes it well worth the price. If you are in downtown Pittsburgh, this is a place you definitely have to try. If you are a foodie like we are, you can't miss this place."
"4.0","Went out of our way to go to this wonderful restaurant as we found out so did many other patrons. First of let me say if you are going don't go unless you got a reservation. Reservations are very loose. We got there just before our 6 and still had to wait. Although I will say it was faster than I thought about 10-15min. Dinner took about 1:15-1:30. Which is why he tells walk ups 1:30 and will tell you these people all called for reservations. The owner was your typical older Italian guy.(In his 80s- Fabulous he still takes an interest and serves as a host. I can see how his attitude can rub people the wrong way but he is just trying to be honest which some take as rude) lucky for us it was a nice evening and we were seated on the patio. He does ask those checking in to go up on the sidewalk where he can see you. That is for the comfort of those eating on the patio and the servers trying to serve them. I wish some people would have realized this. It does not take all 4-6 of you to stand down there to check in. Think about how you would feel if you were one of those patrons on the patio. It is a small place but can easily hold 50 people inside and another 15 .outside. Those that listen to his directions are quickly seated. Onto food. Husband enjoyed a beer. They ran out of tall drinking glasses so I got a small warm water with lemon. Later brought us the tall glasses with Ice.Bruschetta for appetizer-very tasty House Salad could have used more dressing on it. Had to ask for our basket of bread. Husband had Gnocchi-very tasty and large serving. I explored and had the squid linguini with a light cream sauce and lobster( plenty of it) . So glad I tried it. It was very good and lady table next to us had it too and also was happy with it. The little boy behind us had mussels and said he loved them. We had tiramisu for dessert and Americano and Cappuccino. We shared the tiramisu and it was plenty for both of us. The bathrooms are way in the back you actually walk pass the servers station and kitchen to get to them. We were wondering with the crowd how they manage people when it is cold out. The place is too small to have an indoor waiting area. Would love to see them move into a more customer oriented space. Maybe they can find one in the North Hills.Wink Wink. We will look forward to going back in the future. Saw a friend there who says they been going there for 2 years and everything they have ate taste great."
"5.0","Love Hardee's! Not sure if I like lunch or breakfast better  always awesome food. Service isn't bad either"
"5.0","Caffe Mona is my number one go-to place for brunch, coffee, and casual hang-time! The owners are awesome and make every effort to ensure a perfect experience. The servers are efficient-sweet- and attentive, the cooks are hands down the BEST, and the back patio is the cherry on top of what will be the first of many delish brunches. How else will you get to try everything on the menu?!  trust me when I say, you can't go wrong with this place!"
"5.0","As a recent transplant to Pittsburgh, I am wanting to try all the great food here, and this place is great! Such good food! I ordered my delivery through grubhub and not only was my dinner delivery fast, the food was AMAZING! I lived in the U.K. for several years and had some pretty awesome Indian food there, so needles to say I am super picky. However, this place is delicious! I will definitely be ordering from here again!"
"5.0","Today we had a meal that was so expertly crafted and served that was nothing short of exceptional! My sister had the Abby Alexander's angel hair .The dish had the juiciest chicken dressed in a white wine sauce with fresh spinach and tomatoes.We both KNOW that the homemade wedding soup is the best we have tasted in the city!!!! The beans and greens do not lack flavor.Sooooooo good.Lastly, the hot peppers and sausage will knock your socks off! They are so delicious eaten with their famous Italian bread.To end the evening we ordered the tiramisu and a canoliOH SO DELICIOUS. Looking forward to bringing more friends here for dinner.What a great treasure."
"3.0","My wife and I have been here a couple of times before and had a great meal. This time however we weren't impressed. The menu selection was pretty limited and the options available weren't to our liking. I overheard the server offering to make a custom ramen for a table near us after we ordered. I wish we would have known that was an option. Not sure if we'll be back again."
"3.0","My first experience here wasn't so great: I ordered one of the paneer dishes and opened the container to find 4 measly pieces of paneer.  Total bummer.  I decided to give them another shot, though.  This time around, I went with the chicken tikka and was not disappointed.  The chicken was tender, the sauce pleasantly spicy, and the rice steamed to perfection.  Their small size is pretty generous -- no hunger pangs this round!  And $4.50 for a generously sized small?  No hunger pangs for my wallet, either.The only consistent downside is the wait.  This truck is hoppin' during my brief lunch break, and since they make everything fresh (awesome!), the wait is even longer (around 20 minutes today).  However, my understanding is that you can call in your order for pickup if you're short on time."
"4.0","What a great place to eat. Loved the wings. Very friendly staff and always attentive. Price were good and great selection of food."
"4.0","Came here a few days after opening. Our server was very nice and attentive. The burgers were great--juicy and flavorful! Upgraded to the rosemary fries and was verrrry happy with that decision!Ended the evening with shakes made with Millie's ice cream...so delicious.All in all the experience was great, my only qualm was the price! Husband upgraded to a bison burger and it was ~$18!! Yikes!"
"5.0","This is a trendy little spot in Lawrenceville that is very tricky to find. Even when you think you found it there's still four more doors leading up to the dining area you may mistake as the restaurant.The appetizers were amazing one of the things that surprised me is how good the chicken hearts were.Our table also really enjoyed the fried chicken and the squid. They have a private dining room where you sit on the floor to have your dinner. Our server was great and made great recommendations because we did not know we were ordering sometimes.We will be back"
"4.0","We can to get a quick bite, prior to a show. For a Friday night, and all of the events going on this particular evening, i was anticipating a wait and a big crowd. It was busy, but not to walk packed. We were sat immediately. The service was quick and the server was friendly and attentive. The food came out timely and was good. The restaurant has two floors. A bar and dining room on each. It's kid friendly and clean for a bar. In my opinion, more so than their Mt Washington location.We look forward to returning."
"4.0","Very homely and no-frills feel for Vietnamese food. It feels quite authentic, at least to me. The menu is pretty straightforward, although some of the combinations and different prices may be a little confusing. There are mainly a few types of items--noodle soups, including pho, vermicelli (bun), and rice plates (con tam)--with a few varieties in each category. Overall their prices are quite reasonable, and it's only an extra dollar or two more to get combinations of different meats or spring rolls.Having tried the pho, split/broken rice (con tam), and vermicelli (bun) bowl, I think their food is made well in general. The pho broth is very flavorful, and getting the different meats plus shrimp is very worthwhile. The vermicelli with shredded pork, spring roll, and grilled pork was very filling as well. If I had to pick something, I'd probably say that the grilled pork chop as served with the rice was my least favorite. It was a bit dry, and doesn't really compare to Tan Lac Vien. So I'd still stick with the latter for rice but maybe go here for pho."
"5.0","Amazing place. Cappy's has a relaxing atmosphere where you can relax and enjoy the company of old friends. The service is quick, friendly, and efficient. The food is always delicious and the specials are always the best. Plus the prices are reasonable. It's great to see a local business continue to thrive on Walnut street, and if anything is for certain, Cappy's embodies the friendliness and relaxed atmosphere of the great city it inhabits."
"5.0","I've been frequenting the Strip District for breakfast for many years now, but found myself looking for a change of pace (in addition to--and more importantly--some pancakes), and Yelp led me to Cafe Raymond. For some reason the Strip makes me feel like a tourist in my own city (in a good way!), and Cafe Raymond reinforced that as soon as I walked in. Very warm, bright, and inviting, I hopped into a line that moved quickly to place my order. The blueberry ricotta pancakes had been the reason that Cafe Raymond caught my eye on Yelp in the first place, so I put in my order and sat down to enjoy my coffee (which may have been from La Prima--it was delicious!) to ride out the short wait to my pancakes.Now these pancakes... did not disappoint. I had been jonesing pancakes for days before this visit, and they were perfectly dense yet still fluffy and not too heavy, having a generous amount of blueberries dotted throughout. It came with whipped cream (which I was initially not super excited about, but after taking a bite, the effect of blueberries and cream came through) as well as local maple syrup on the side. It was a generous portion and I left full.I would love to come back to sample the lunch menu--other folks around me looked like they had some delicious sandwiches and salads. Service was friendly and fast."
"3.0","Quik It has been around for a long time and I remember my mom stopping by after church to pick up chicken for dinner or just to munch on. I was in the neighborhood and had a hankering for something soulful, so I stopped.I MUST say something about the appearance of the 'joint'. This is a gas station, restaurant and hair place rolled into one but separated by 2 doors. Talk about convenience...if you're into weaves n stuff. Lol The restaurant looks like a fast food establishment but nothing was inviting about it. There are signs advertising specials everywhere but they are very confusing because a few of them had different prices for the same combos. You're better off just paying attention to the board behind the counter. To the left of the counter are a few old greasy fryers and based on the looks of them, I doubt they work. No big deal but they're dirty and I just wonder why someone would put them there...of all places. Did I say they are dirty?The sides are set up in plain view, just like the picture on here shows.  I'm addition to the items I selected, the case held stewed tomatoes, red beans n rice, stuffing, mashed potatoes, gravy, corn, green beans and I may be missing something. There were sweets advertised on one of the posters but I don't remember seeing a list of what was available. The chicken is supposed to be the star of the show but, when I visited tonight, it was sitting off to the side with no warmer on and I didn't smell that just fried chicken smell. You know the smell I'm talking about. (Unless you've never fried chicken--- tell me it ain't so!) Anyway, I didn't feel like being inquisitive so I just went with the Quik It bowl which consisted of 2 sides and cornbread for $3.99. I chose greens and Mac n cheese to go. The lady who waited on us was very nice and offered up smiles which I truly appreciate. When I got home and tasted everything, it wasn't bad. I will even venture to say it was tasty. The greens were seasoned well. The Mac n cheese was the Stouffer type but a tad bit cheesier if that makes sense. It was the comfort food I needed on this chilly night. Now, the cornbread muffin may need its own review because it was HEAVENLY! OMG...it was like a sweet pillow of moist ground corn. Sorry, I can't even put it into words. Let me put it to you like this, when I saw my daughter almost throw away her untouched muffin, I was ready to dive across the kitchen to stop her from committing that sin! Lol It really was yummy!I plan to go back and visit to try the chicken from my past and then update this review."
"5.0","YYEEESSSS!!!!! Recently moved to Pittsburgh and we were craving Chinese food. We found our new place! We got delivery and the food was still steaming when it got to our building. Portions were bigger than expected and it tasted great!"
"5.0","I used to live on Mt. Washington and I miss Cafe Cravings so much.  I so miss not being able to walk there anymore.  Their drinks and food are awesome, just awesome.  My mom always gets a green tea latte and she said that theirs is way better than Starbucks.  And I need to mention Vicki and Keith, the owners.  I think those are the right names.  They are so unbelievably friendly and after just a few visits I would walk in and Vicki immediately knew my drink order.  And Keith is usually singing!  It just made me happy going in there!"
"1.0","Servers look unhappy. I have to say that this restaurant has the worst service(among dozens of restaurant I've been to) in pittsburgh.There is a 15% mandatory service fee in the bill. I would like to give 10% or lower if I had any other choice.Food tastes ok but not better than cheaper chinese food restaurants."
"4.0","On Mount Washington, this place was a bit out of my way but I'm glad I stopped by for their Happy Hour. There's a bar and some tables, and it was pretty busy and loud by the time my friend and I got there around 6. Just as we made our way to the bar, we noticed that one of the tables was being cleaned up. We asked the bartender if we could sit down there, and he told us to go for it. Within a few minutes, a server brought us some water and took our orders. She let us know that we should make our cocktail orders ahead of time, because it can take a bit for them to come out (especially because it was pretty busy).The real stars of the show here are the cocktails, and you should definitely take advantage of their happy hour deal ($6)! There's most likely a drink for everyone given their extensive menu. For snacks, we ordered the Cheese Plate and the House Cut Fries off the Happy Hour menu. The Cheese Plate was great, and I loved the candied nuts that came with it. It came with three types of cheese which were all good, but two of them were pretty similar from what I remember. The fries were nice as well, but I think they accidentally gave us the Tomato Chipotle Aioli instead of the Garlic Rosemary one we ordered. Didn't bother me too much because it was still delicious! Would order the fries again next time.Final tips: Be careful going down the steep stairs to the bathroom (especially after a few drinks)! Also if you haven't already, it's worth checking out the view of downtown Pittsburgh from the nearby overlook."
"4.0","Amazing tacos. Interior is tight but the food is always great.  Not a place to sit down to eat and linger.  Think street food in a store front and you'll fall in love. Serve is somewhat fast despite the place always being slammed with orders. The menu has staples but at the same time there is almost always something innovating simmering to be served up for the day."
"3.0","Not too impressed with the corned beef sandwich.. I figure if you have the words 'Famous Corned Beef' in you name it better be damn good... This one wasn't at all."
"4.0","Excellent selection for the most part.  But one does need to know how to buy in a fish area as issues of freshness become apparent at times.  Staff generally courteous and helpful.  The Shrimp area ... need to go back again and see the selection.  Location iconic to Pittsburgh with ample parking within 2 blocks."
"4.0","This restaurant has a cool and casual feel and lives up to it's name serving some great burgers.  The burgers are $13 and for $1 you can upgrade your fries to rosemary fries, which is a must!  The food comes out on mismatched china, which I love.  I had the morningside burger which was topped with American cheese, egg, bacon, and mayo and it was delicious!  I was also able to get a Groupon and save some money which made the food taste even better.  I would definitely check Groupon before you go in case there is a deal!  Burgh'ers also brews their own beer, which I haven't tried yet, but I look forward to it on my next visit!  Overall, I think Burgh'ers is a great addition to Lawrenceville!"
"3.0","I had been wanting to check this place out for a long time! I have heard such great things about the food and the beer! First of all, the space is super cute! It is very small and we had a large group of people attending for a going away party on a sunday evening but we did not make a reservation. The beer selection was small but the beer was very good. The food was also excellent, I got the diner burger and a few in our party got the beef brisket which looked awesome and so did the schnitzel sandwich! The only reason I did not give this review a higher rather is because the service was not good. The entire group that I was with are all current or previous bartenders and servers so we understand being busy and how the restaurant industry works! It was a slow sunday evening and our large group of friends seemed annoy the waitress whose section we ended up in which was on the main floor near the bar. They didn't seem to want to wait on us and finally offered us a private second floor space which was great! Being that it was slow, we thought that perhaps the waitress would be excited to make money off of us but she did not come by very often and half of our group had to make frequent trips down to the bar to keep fresh drinks. The place closed at 10:00pm and the waitress brought us checks by 9:00pm not even offering last call, clearly wanting to be done with her shift. Overall, i would go back for the food and give it another shot!"
"5.0","Start to finish excellent service. The food was absolutely delicious! I had the lobster roll and 2 lbs of Alaskan king crab. It was cooked to perfection and is now one of my favorite meals of all time!! I will be back soon!"
"5.0","Second time I visited here  and it was awesome. Started with a mix of west coast oysters. Shared the Captain Crunch Roll and had a Caesar Salad with wild Alaskan Salmon! The salmon was cooked perfectly. Our server Kevin was very knowledgeable with our oyster selection. He had a big section all to himself and not once did I see him struggle, fluster or forgetful. He let us know that Tuesday's are half off oysters and Thursdays are 1/2 off sushi. We will definitely be back to partake in those specials."
"4.0","First off, I wish I saw the 30% off deal (per the Yelp page) for calling in the order! I'm a little bummed about that since I ordered via eat24 (owned by Yelp). Oh well!I am not from the area, so I looked around on Yelp and Eat24 before settling on Beta Bites for dinner while staying near the Convention Center. I ordered the chicken sandwich, side of okra, and a Gatorade. I didn't know that the sandwich came with fries, so it ended up being a lot more food than I expected! Everything was great- my only complaint would be the bread to chicken/veggies ratio (lots of bread, not much in the sandwich). The fries and okra were delicious, as were the sauces on the side. I just couldn't finish everything.Food came on time, delivery man was friendly, and everything was under $20! I would definitely order from them again if I'm back in the city!"
"5.0","I always love coming here! The staff is so nice, and the drinks are always tasty! My favorite is the honeydew smoothie with strawberry bursting balls."
"4.0","Who doesn't love Italian food? (If you don't, just go with it.) I'm definitely a fan of Buca's food, not their service. Even on a slow night, everything takes forever. I know that every time I want to eat at Buca's, I'll have to prepare myself for the monologue from the waitress. If it involved their food specials, I'd be fine with it. Instead, I'm borderline harassed to fill out a card. No thanks. The only other issue I had was when they ran out of mozzarella.They. Ran. Out. Of. Mozzarella.I'm pretty sure I asked the waitress to repeat herself seeing as how mozzarella was on every single dish I wanted to order. I pressed on. I mean, it's common for an Italian restaurant to be out of a main ingredient, right? ...Anyway, as far as the food, I'm a fan. I always order their stuffed mushroom appetizer, which could very well be an entree. Also, I make sure to share a dish with someone because there's no way one person could polish off all that pasta. (If you can and do, congrats!) I've never been disappointed with their food. I try a new dish every time I go, which isn't normal for me, but I know the menu's descriptions are accurate.Some dishes I enjoy: Ravioli al Pomodoro, Spicy Chicken Rigatoni, Linguine Frutti di Mare, Gnocchi al Telefono, and Chicken Carbonara."
"5.0","Small hole in the wall restaurant. Staff was mediocre. Veggie fried momos are delicious. Chicken Nepali is not great but the sides are yummy."
"3.0","Sausalido attempts to be a quaint Mediterranean bistro. I believe the intimate atmosphere accommodates that very well, and the service is admirable. It is a good place to take a date, which I did (pimpin aint easy, I know). From there, the maitre d is accommodating with the corkage and you can let all your conversational juices flow over a nice glass of red wine. The staff likes to give appetizers on the house, which are generally delicious. I found several other appetizers to be well prepared, but very basic. I believe one was akin to a cheesy baked potato with bacon. Those are always tasty, but  I could make that when I was a culinary challenged college student.My main course was a simple seafood and veggie pasta a la oligio. It seemed a bit bland, and would have probably been better with fresh cracked black pepper, some truffle salt, and shredded Gruyere. When a restaurant is trying to convey an attitude of beauty through simplicity, the utmost attention must be given to a dish to justify its price point. Yes, pasta is simple, but there needs to be a delicate balance of high quality flavors to make the simple into elegant.I still enjoyed the experience, but feel Sausalido is encountering the troubles that I see of other up and coming Pgh restaurants. They are trying to be something through their image, but not accounting for the details which bring it to life. You can get away with that in Pgh, but it wouldn't fly in a larger city."
"5.0","Love to support this place as it is the most authentic Malaxiangguo I have tried ***in Pittsburgh***. The self-serving style brings me back home."
"5.0","This is my favorite bar in the mount and one of my favorite bars in all of Pittsburgh. The featured cocktails are all delicious. Seriously, you can't go wrong. Especially if you show your face during happy hour where all featured drinks are a measly $6 (Just an FYI: I'm planning on naming my first born Leora, because that drink is my world).Hoity toity snooty pants mixologists slinging bespoke drinks with a side of pretension make me want to cry in my tumbler. But you don't have to worry about that here. You'll get a darn good bespoke drink if you ask for it, but the bartenders are lovely and down to Earth. These are craft cocktails done right. Food is great as well. Some of my faves include the Elote Dip, Goat Cheese Fritters, and everything on the brunch menu. Menu items change seasonally so there's always something new to try. This bar has been such a great addition to the neighborhood. Whether you want to unwind with coworkers over some board games and drinks, or you're trying to impress a date or out-of-towner with dinner, The Summit has you covered."
"5.0","Wow! What a great find. Authentic Portuguese food cooked by the owner. Her childhood recipes to boot. Obviously she knows what she is doing. The lunch we had was amazing. We had the cod casserole and a octopus casserole. Both exceptionally delicious. My favorite was the Cod. Great prices, great service, an immaculately clean restaurant. Must go."
"5.0","My best friend and I go there all the time to grab drinks and to get the popcorn. Found out that they had a pretty good burger too! It can get crowded during popular bar times, but the cocktails are always good. If it's you're first time trying it, try to get there when it isn't too busy."
"5.0","AMAZING EXPERIENCE. The food was exceptional. Cocktails were strong and so creative flavor wise.  Definitely a top pick for date nights."
"4.0","Great value pizza. Not the best best pizza ever, but a very good pizza to hit the spot when you are hungry or to have with a beer."
"5.0","I eat here at least once a week. always busy, the staff is friendly & efficient. probably the best tacos in town. the menu is short, but simple, and I'm fine with that."
"4.0","I love this place. Great neighborhood dive bar with awesome bar food. Bartenders are super friendly and there always seems to be a nice crowd of people there. I would give them 5 stars but their pretzel cheese game is weak. Soft pretzels are my favorite but when I crave them I have to go somewhere else:-( the cheese just isn't good. If they switched to a beer cheese or shit just melt some cheddar ... It would make my world!! But on a positive note-their honey mustard is on point!"
"4.0","Visited here for the first time today and got gua bao sliders which had pork belly like meat in the middle and some veggies along with hoisin sauce, which tastes sort of like a sweeter thick soy sauce. I never ordered from this place before but I dont regret a single bit of it. I got a alarm thing, which beeped when my food was ready. It took around 5-8ish minutes to get my food after I ordered. The potatoes were decent and wasn't really special but I ain't complaining"
"3.0","This place is a hidden gem in the Strip District.  Not only do they have some delicious food, the service and atmosphere are great as well.The place is setup in an older style lunch spot way.  You order as you walk in from a chalkboard and seat yourself.  Everything from the plates to the seating go with their overall theme.  The kitchen is open to the restaurant which is a cool look.  The workers could not have been more friendly.  They gave us their picks for the best meal and side dish options.  They also got us our food very fast.For my meal I had the blues burger.  It had bacon, blue cheese crumbles, and blue cheese sauce.  The flavors all came together it tasted delicious.  The peppercorn crusting was a little much and It was over cooked for the medium rare I ordered, but was still great.  Finally, the brioche bun was one of the best burger buns I have ever had and held all of the ingredients together perfectly.I will definitely be back to try some more of their burgers and sandwiches."
"5.0","All food items are baked..So lots of healthy options. Plus service is great. We r lucky to have discovered this place."
"4.0","I came in here for lunch on a Thursday - the place was empty, which made me sad, but it meant that I got my take-out chicken shawarma sandwich very quickly.  The server was funny and friendly, and offered me a glass of water while I waited.  The sandwich came out in only a few minutes, and was big enough for me to make 2 small meals out of it.  It was hot, with seasoned chicken inside, along with lettuce, tomato, and nutty tahini sauce.  Actually, I'm craving one now just thinking about it. I was surprised that they weren't more busy, given the friendly service and fresh, tasty food.  I hope to have the chance to come back soon - I'm almost never on the South Side, but I'd definitely return if I was nearby again."
"5.0","it is not unusual to find me at LaFeria once or twice a week. It is one of the top few places in Pittsburgh to have a casual lunch or dinner that is guaranteed to be delicious every time. I have convinced almost every member of my friends and family to dine here and now they crave it too! The daily specials are fantastic, but my old faithful is the La Feria salad with Turkey and a heaping pile of sweet potato chips. I have never ordered anything here that I have not loved. The service is very casual but friendly, and are very accommodating for BYOB needs. The cafe also doubles as a shop with a lot of really fun items to peruse after your meal. I cannot say enough good things about this place, it is a Pittsburgh treasure!"
"5.0","This is a wonderfully operated family run and owned gem off Centre Ave. The food is delicious. They always have a special which is delicious. The cookies and pastry display has had only good things to offer that I have found. The cupcakes are incredible. Cool flavored coffee's I have yet to try the ice cream but I'm sure that's good too. It's also really well decorated. Very nice atmosphere."
"4.0","I drive by this place all the time and could not wait to try it. Over the summer the windows open up and people look like they are having a blast.  We finally got there last week and it is cute and cozy inside yet trendy.  They do not serve food but a great place to go for a cocktail. I did not think the prices were high and got a draft beer for $5. They had a nice selection of drafts including the pineapple beer from Rivertown-one of my favorites. My date went with a cocktail, an apple cider drink of some sort, slightly more expensive at $9 but worth the price. The music was good, it wasn't too crowded so we were able to get a table around 9:30 on a Friday night and they have board games that you can play at your table."
"4.0","Always like the food here. If you're in the area the capital Grille has great steaks but you will pay for it so be prepared. Always go hungry and treat yourself once in a while"
"5.0","Delicious Thai cuisine.   I've been here twice with colleagues for lunch and highly recommend this place.  I would definitely come here more if it were closer to where I work.  Don't be deterred by the tacky sign in front--it's all about the food.  Every dish I've had here has been great so far.   You can specify the spiciness of your dishes as well.  Wonton soup ($3.00): warm, soft wontons with chicken and shrimp in chicken broth.  Tom Yum Chicken ($3.00): lemongrass, mushrooms, chili, and lime juice.  It's a Thai soup definitely worth a try.  Cashew Nuts chicken ($8.95): chicken, onions, carrots, bell peppers, water chestnuts, snow peas, and roasted chili paste.  This is more of a Chinese dish.  It's delicious nonetheless.  Red curry ($8.95): roasted duck, tomatoes, bell peppers, basil leaves and pineapple in a coconut curry sauce.  Very delicious curry that goes great with rice.   Basil Leaves Chicken ($8.95): chicken, onions, bell peppers, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, garlic & chili.  Outstanding blend of spices with vegetables and chicken.  Be sure to pay for parking!  My colleague's meter ran out by about 15 minutes, and he got a ticket."
"5.0","Everyone in town raves about Primanti's. However, this has to be my more favorite place to stop while in Pittsburgh. They have an awesome menu (cash only) but you cannot leave and not get the Roethli'burger'. Delicious. Yum. Heck to the yes. I love the small kitchen style atmosphere, and they love it when you tip. I mean, they go nuts when you do (Ala Cold Stone singing style nuts). Great people, even better food. Come hungry!"
"2.0","A few years ago, they had a great shrimp po boy and a French dip sandwich that was rather impressive for a bar. After a recent visit, it looks like ownership has changed. A change in ownership can mean two things: things will be better or things will go downhill. Whether a change in ownership occurred or not, I'm sad to say that Hambone's has gone downhill.Our server, who could've possibly been the owner (and the only staff member working that Friday night) started by asking, 'Have you been here before?' We said, 'Yes.' She replied, 'And you came back?' Not quite the response we were expecting. She continued to explain that the menu has changed and that she cooks everything herself so therefore, everything is delicious. Such confidence that woman had. But hey, there's nothing wrong with confidence so we left it up to the food to speak for that bold statement. We ordered the buffalo chicken dip, pulled pork sandwich and shrimp po boy. The buffalo chicken dip was edible, but not all too great. Honestly, you can make a better-tasting one at home and it would be quicker too (which I'll explain more in a little bit). The pulled pork wasn't bad, but wasn't great either. There just wasn't anything special that you can't throw together yourself in the crockpot. And finally the shrimp po boy. I was excited for this sandwich but it just wasn't the same as what I remembered. Something was different and I can't seem to really put my finger on what that difference was. The shrimp was soggy and the fries use to be fresh cut. During this visit, they were the frozen kind you can find at any old bar. What a bummer to cut corners like that: to replace fresh with frozen. I'm hoping that that was just a one-time thing. As far as the service goes, there was just one do-it-all person working the dining room that night so needless to say, service was agonizingly slow. In the time it took for us to get waited on, to get menus, then to actually order, and then to receive our appetizer (the buffalo chicken dip), you might as well save some time and spend 35 minutes making it at home. If you know me, I always love a divey hidden gem, but with below average bar food, a cocky employee, understaffing and slow service, I regret to say I probably won't be back."
"5.0","Always have to come to Pamela's when I come back to Pittsburgh. Always crowded for breakfast on the weekends but so worth it. And the prices are right for the amount of food you get!"
"4.0","Hambone's is divided into two sections. The restaurant area in the back serves pub-grub like wings, burgers, 'hamwiches' and most everything else that's fried or dunked in ranch. Like most pub-grub it's something to eat, not a brush with culinary genius. The bar carries interesting local brews on tap like Rowhouse Red (from Philadelphia) and a couple unusual varieties of Yuengling. However, the best way to illustrate why you need to go to Hambone's at least once in your life is this story.Man to bartender, 'I need six shots of Jager!'Bartender, 'We ran out.'Man (huge incredulous sigh of exasperation), 'Out of Jager?!' Bartender, 'We ran out 10 minutes ago--sorry!'Man, 'Alright...gimme six shots of Rumple Mintze!'Bartender, 'We got Rumple Minze!'"
"3.0","I ate here once for lunch because I was recommended it by a co-worker. She told me that these tacos were the best in Pittsburgh. I was not impressed. The service was phenomenal. Everyone I talked to was super smiley and complimentary. I also really enjoyed how there was a giant menu behind the counter that I could look at and order from. The tacos were average in my opinion. Nothing really wowed me. I ordered a lengua taco and an al pastor. I was disappointed in the pineapples on the al pastor. It seemed like they were just cubed pineapples from the can. They didn't add the fresh sweetness I typically expect from an al pastor taco.  The lengua was also sub-par. Nothing impressive to report. The tamal I ordered was the best thing I ate. The tamal was very soft and delicate however, very tasty. In wish I would've ordered three of them. I'd try this place again and order something other than tacos however, there is nothing that I experienced that would make me want to come back."
"4.0","I came here on a Friday night around 9 pm with my boyfriend and my parents, who were staying at a nearby B and B.  We wanted to go somewhere both casual and inexpensive, and La Feria definitely is both of those things.  We almost didn't find it - it's upstairs above Pamela's.  Pamela's was closed of course, but all the lights were on, and we eventually figured out to ascend the staircase and seek out La Feria. There was only one other table of diners, so it was very quiet in the eating area.  There are about 15 tables, and there are boldly colored Peruvian crafts everywhere you look!  We all decided to order lemonade and limeade, which was a great choice.  The drinks were refreshing and fresh, not too sour or too sweet.I ordered one of the daily specials, which was chicken in a spicy peanut sauce.  It came with white rice, a green salad (with two kinds of cheese, two tomatoes slices, an olive, red onion, walnuts, and light dressing), and two slices of French bread.  The chicken itself was great - the sauce had a delicious peanut flavor and it went wonderfully with the rice.  I really liked the salad as well because the dressing was flavorful and I looooove cheese.  The bread was pretty standard, so I used it for dipping in leftover peanut sauce.  Nom!  My boyfriend got the ropa vieja sandwich, which I tasted.  Not as much meat as I'd like, but it was very juicy and flavorful.  Also the sweet potato chips that came on the side were totally addicting!For dessert, we had a few shortbread cookies with what seemed like dulce de leche on them.  Everyone really enjoyed their meal.  It just feels like a good place to spend your money.  It's small, it's cheap, it's interesting food, and all their crafts are lovely and very affordable.  I think we'd be happy to go back if we were ever in the neighborhood.  I really want to taste those empanadas...."
"5.0","I come here at least twice a month, always good service. Rarely have issues, salad Bar is always fresh! One of my favorite eat n parks."
"5.0","This was the second time I have been to Mezzo and I have not had a bad experience. The service is impeccable, even down to the bussers everybody is polished and seemingly intelligent. I would encourage you to plan to come here early and check out the rooftop bar which is absolutely amazing. At dinner we started with the Chef's Selection which is the Chef's Selection of Charcuterie, Cheeses, and Preserves, as well as bread. This plate was phenomenal and each pairing was better than the last. Additionally we ordered the poached pear appetizer and it was extremely well done overall. With goat cheese and Brussels sprouts this unique dish really will have you thinking.Onto my meal - I stuck with what in most cases would be considered the boring choice 'Spaghetti and Meatballs'. However, this amazing dish has such a rich taste that it was anything but the boring. The meatballs were perfectly crafted, marinara with ricotta cheese, and basil to top it all off. Incredible experience yet again, I just wished I ordered a second dish to bring home."
"3.0","Great location and fun for drinks on a beautiful day. If their food quality was better it would be worth the price, because it's just OK at best. That's the only thing missing from this place which is too bad cuz other than the food I love it."
"5.0","When the new owners took over a few months back I wasn't sure what to expect.It's the perfect little city bodega. Lots of staple, pantry grocery items as well as beverages, deli selections and more.You can have a custom made sandwich for around $6-$7 and I get one now and again. My office is at Butler and 53rd so this market is a great lunch option for me.I'm really happy this place still exists and is actually better than what it once was."
"4.0","What a great restaurant inside the casino. My wife and I were doing some gambling and looked around for a place to have lunch. Came across this restaurant and was surprised how much the menu contained. Both of our meals were very good. I had a huge plate of nachos and she had a philly cheese steak with waffle fries/ huge pickle. Our waiter was quick and the restaurant was clean and had a view of the water. We will definitely eat here again. Didn't give 5 stars because the margarita machine was broken! So I didn't get to have one and I was in the mood for a frozen margarita with lunch lol."
"5.0","We came here based on a recommendation and the fact we needed to go to the Apple Store a few doors down.  We put our names in and had to wait about 30-35 min.  Large group waiting meant this was good to go! Staff was very friendly and fast.  We ordered and the food was there within 10 min.  Very impressed.  I ordered a stuffed hot cake with blueberries and it came out looking like a crepe which I loved.  The resin was that the hot cakes were stuffed with blueberries.  Definitely got your money's worth here.  Portions were not to bad or I learned my lesson from the day before.  Price was also very good too! They also have a location in the Strip District.  I recommend!"
"4.0","This was a special event that we were looking forward to for a few weeks. One week prior, i went online to change our reservation from 6 to 6:30. I received s confirmation email immediately. When we showed up right around  6:30 the hostess (talker one with long get hair) copped an attitude telling me that our reservation was for 6. I showed her the confirmation for 6:30, which she begrudgingly agreed but qualified that i 'must have changed it on the web...'.  That was a bad way to start out out celebration dinner.  I told the maitre he graciously apologized.  Maria was our very attentive server and the team supporting her was well coordinated.  Except for the rude greeter, everyone used appropriate 'Ritz Carlton' language and backed it up with very good service. Oh, the food, Well it was top shelf."
"3.0","We went there in a group for Sunday lunch! I wish I went for a full menu, I really don't like buffet that much, most of the food were too spicy for a non Indian.It was 8$ for lunch, which was reasonable."
"4.0","Stopped by the new spiffy EnP.  Very nice new building with a drive up window.  We came for breakfast and I had the Eggs Benedict Florentine.  Delicious!  The poached eggs were cooked perfectly.  The hollandaise was tasty and seasoned.  The bacon, spinach and English muffin were a winning combination."
"1.0","Stopped in and sat at the bar. Planning on having a beer and eating something for dinner. The woman behind the bar didn't know anything about the beers and never came back to take our food order.  A guy behind the bar asked if we wanted another beer when our glasses were empty. We asked for our check and left."
"5.0","Just went here for the first time last Sunday. Delicious food! Love, love, love the interior decorations and theme, including the names of each dish! I can't remember exactly what they were called, but I had the poutine, a deviled egg, and the curry. It was all so good!  This is now my favorite vegan restaurant in Pittsburgh!"
"4.0","parking in the southside isn't as difficult as i thought it was going to be.  check down the side streets and you're sure to find a spot within 10 minutes TOPS.  mario's is a great spot for some appetizers and drinks.  the happy hour on friday was a little loud and the bar music was competing with some dude singing and playing guitar in the other room.  here's the thing, the chicken nachos were $4 or $5 during happy hour and my cocktails were $2 a piece.  this is a steal!  you can't make chicken nachos at home for $5.  the nachos are served with sour cream and salsa and i was pleased that the waitress brought a little cup of each for both me and my man.  we love mario's especially at the happy hour price.  yummy nachos, strong drinks, chill atmosphere, cheap prices is our equivalent to a great night out.  i recommend eating in the bar area.  the tables in the other area (where the dude was singing) seem claustraphobic."
"4.0","Ki Ramen is a great addition to Pittsburgh. We got the Shoyu Ramen and Dan Dan Ramen and the flavors were great. Service was fast and the staff were friendly."
"5.0","Great place to grab breakfast or lunch in the Strip District. Located on Penn Ave. Food ordered and paid for at the counter and brought out to you when it is ready. Prices maybe a few dollars more than I would have expected for this type of set up but it was very good so I don't really mind that. My husband and I ate for $29.00. Not huge inside so I could imagine it would get very busy on the weekends here. Business appeared clean. Restrooms for customers in the basement. My husband had the blue cheese burger which he said was really good. Came with side of chips. The blueberry ricotta pancakes were fabulous and I highly recommend them to anyone who likes pancakes! The omelette was also excellently made with the perfect ratio of ingredients to eggs. Looking forward to coming back and trying one of their speciality sandwiches or salads!"
"5.0","Been here in 2016 and early December 2018. Not sure why the rating is low. The ambience is very comforting and pleasant. And I enjoyed my visit on both the times.The first time (2016), we had lunch and ordered an Alfredo with Penne. It was creamy and flavorful, an Alfredo I preferred. The only reason I didn't go back was because I was a student and I wanted to eat veryyyy cheap and save some greens in my pocket. :PThe second time (2018), we got dinner. We ordered some Fried Ravioli which had a good crispiness and a soft filling. It was served with a hearty Marinara sauce.I also got an Angel Hair Pasta with Marsala Wine sauce, mushrooms and roasted red peppers. The taste was just the right amount of savory to keep eating forever. Mostly a toned down tanginess and a little black pepper, along with he hint of sweetness from the roasted red peppers. I paired this with a glass of Australian red wine that I don't currently recall (it was a new one on our server's recommendation). But I remember it being a good recommendation.I would definitely recommend this place if you want a good Italian dining experience for a reasonable price! :)"
"4.0","Came in around 11am on Sunday and were able to be seated without any difficulty.The Chicken and Waffles was some of the best I've had anywhere in the US! The chicken was well seasoned, cooked to tender perfection and the crust was not greasy at all. The waffles were crisp on the outside but light and fluffy on the inside. The gravy it was served, with was a great compliment to the dish without being overpoweringly salty. Our server was also very attentive and made sure we were well taken care of."
"1.0","Alright, I think i'm gonna be the oddball review but I thought this place was disgusting... I watched one of the employees literally stick his hand under his shirt to itch his chest then continue making a drink, my boyfriend, myself, and our 2 friends waited over 40 minutes for 2 grilled cheeses.. which were mediocre. i had the devil wears gouda and it was slimy. my boyfriend got a turkey club and it didn't have turkey (which we did not know until we got home).. honestly just a very bad vibe and bad service."
"5.0","Great meal and almond milk latte! Smells really good the moment you walk in and great atmosphere. Thanks Chef!"
"1.0","Food was horrible. Clam chowder nasty. I got the 'fresh cut onion rings'.  They were not fresh they were from the freezer.  The same ones you get at the grocery store. The fish sandwich had no taste at all. The service was bad too. The waiter took my bill and money and never came back with the change. It was more than I was going to tip but wasn't worth the wait. I'll never go back."
"5.0","Awesome dining experience in the strip District. shrimp volcano was delicious as was Lobster and shrimp pizza.  we also had mahi mahi tacos and sushi. Nice beer selection on tap"
"4.0","Nice place to hang out or work. There are some cool art work on the wall. It's nice to see the front open in summer. I like their cappuccino, though the latte art could be improved a little bit.I'd like to try some food items next time :)"
"2.0","I can't say I'm too excited about Sushi Fuku. I have been here several times and have tried their rolls and bowls. You're pretty limited by the number and amount of ingredients you can add to a bowl. They even have a limit to the number of veggies that can be added to an order. I think the food here is overpriced and the quality of the fish isn't that great. The line moves quickly, but then again, not many people frequent Sushi Fuku compared to the numerous neighboring businesses."
"3.0","This place oozes fried seafood, you can just feel/smell/taste it all around you.  Didn't have any food just a beer, which the selection was not very good.   Cool little place though, more of a old time diner than a dinner restaurant."
"4.0","I've come to this place two times for music trivia on Wednesdays. It's a fun environment, with a draft special. It is $2 off all drafts during trivia. I had the mule, which was ok, but expensive. Would like to try the food sometime because it looks good. The bartenders are attentive and know what they're doing."
"5.0","I have to say this again, Kiku is my favorite sushi restaurant in the Burgh!! This time we sat at the sushi bar and ordered nigiri (single fish sushi), actually we ordered the omakase (chef's choice). The fish quality is great. I can care less about the maki rolls. If you get the maki rolls, the quality and flavor of the fish can get lost. Also, you won't get to have the fatty tuna in a roll. You'll be missing out!I highly recommend the nigiri and sashimi for sushi because you're able to really enjoy how wonderful each piece of fish tastes. It is definitely the way to go!"
"4.0","Just finished another great dish from La Feria, black bean and rice casserole with fried bananas on top - one of their vegetarian daily specials. The fried bananas added a perfect sweetness to this dish, balancing the heaviness of the black beans and rice. Did I detect a little spiciness in the casserole too?I love this little Peruvian destination, and it's certainly a great place to pick up a healthy, fresh lunch. A little underrepresented, and I can understand why this place is often confused with a souvenir shop (probably because the decor is devoted souly to Peruvian paraphernalia...that you can buy). I highly recommend going regardless."
"5.0","A great little undiscovered place that is frequented by locals and people like us that are always looking to find unusual little places to go to.... And Caffe La Mona  is certainly that! My daughter took me for birthday brunch and even though the menu is not as large as during the week, there were a lot of choices on the menu  Everything was fresh, tastefully prepared and presented. The service was great( not sure where everybody's coming from with complaints of slow or non-existent service, not this day) . For sure we will be returning there!!"
"5.0","I have nothing but good things to say about The Capital Grille! My boyfriend and I have been a few times and the service and food have been amazing each time. I know this is a steak house but I highly recommend the tuna. It was absolutely delicious as was the lobster Mac n cheese! The lobster bisque was great too, lots of lobster in it! Our server Amber was wonderful. We mentioned that we were there for a late valentines dinner and at the end of our meal she brought out 2 complimentary desserts! Cheesecake and chocolate espresso cake, omg they were to die for and the perfect size. She also gave me a rose for valentines as well, which was super sweet. This restaurant is a bit on the expensive side but if you have a special occasion this is the place to come to get a great meal plus they treat you like gold! It's an all around great dining experience that is so worth it!"
"3.0","I always get food from Hello Bistro. I've been to the Oakland location and the Mccandless Location. The downtown location I always order online before picking up . I ordered for 12:30 . When you order online you go straight to the pick up window. My order was not ready. I waited 20 minutes for my food. There was no one at the register to acknowledge that I ordered to go. There was a guy running orders to the tables whom was very fast and efficient. If there busiest times are 12-2 they should not allow online orders during those times. Then finally 12:55 there are paper bags labeled with names . You have to flag someone down to let them know to place the order."
"5.0","This is my favorite place in Pittsburgh for hoagies. The bread is incredible. It looks as though it's a complete dive.... but as I know, this is when food is sometimes at its best. Everything they have is great. I usually get the Big Wheeler. It has ground steak and hot sausage with provolone. I get it with onions and lettuce also. Many of my friends go here and everyone loves it. I have never heard of anything bad said about peppi's. Good to sit and eat or grab it to go. You wont be unhappy, I promise."
"4.0","Great experience here - and I really enjoyed my food. My husband, toddler and I went for lunch. We got the falafel wrap, chicken shawarma wrap, chicken nuggets, fries, baklava and samosas. I thought the food was really good - although my falafel wrap had a little of a weird taste to it. Also, we ordered tabouleh - but it never arrived with our food, and by the time we realized, we had already tossed the receipt. I will definitely return and I'm looking forward to trying other items."
"5.0","What can I say about this place.. I'd have not survived years of lunch in Pittsburgh without Salems.. A must try for those who like Indian, Pakistani, Afghani, Persian or any other middle eastern food.. Everything is displayed behind a glass counter and you can choose 2/3 entrees with rice or naan.. And they wouldn't hold back on quantity in a Togo box..  Plus, they sell goat meat at their butcher section.. A must visit for strip district visitors.."
"1.0","This place is a good option for having lunch buffet on weekdays but I will not recommend it for ala carte. Being a vegetarian, I ordered 'shahi paneer' today and the veg they served was some other common paneer dish made in pure tomato based gravy but it was not shahi paneer. It was not my first time in the restaurant but definitely the last time as it am really disappointed with such service. If they do not have or wish to serve the dish ordered by customers then they should have conveyed the same with suitable reasons."
"4.0","Stopped here after a baseball game for Pizza with the kiddos!The pizza was pretty good!Breadsticks were also fresh and tasty!Its a pizza shop, so there's not much else to report.They do sell beer (ToGo and for In-house).Seating for dining is minimal, but it is very clean!I'd def stop in again.Parking can be dicey, though  ;)"
"4.0","A lovely dinner. First, they offer a corkage fee for the Benneserre Phenomenon that I brought, although the wine list offers a nice selection at reasonable mark ups. Started with the homemade mozzarella,  quite nice with a good amount of parma prosciutto included.  The grilled calamari was well prepared,  a little heavy on the fingerling potatoes.  Followed with an arugula salad, the artichoke companata with chickpeas was delicious.  Next was polenta with poached octupus,  again delicious,  the polenta a little softer than I prefer. Ended with cavatelli with a mushroom and leek ragu, superb. I look forward to our next visit. My compliments to the chef."
"5.0","Place was so yummy unique and sheik ! Ithere was a Dj who was AMAZINGGG playing tunes I've never heard and ones I love. Mostly pop and hip hop. Some international songs also. Our server was so nice ! I got the rice bowl don't Remmeber the name but it was MORE than enough.  And so so good. . I also got the zucchini with ground chicken which I sadly did not like. It has a sweet taste to it that I would've liked to be spicy instead because I didn't like the sweet mixed with all the pepper... Would totally go back small place. Quick service. Awesome drinks highly recommend!"
"1.0","It was a really nice day out so my boyfriend and I wanted to go somewhere where we could eat outdoors. He had never been to Redfin Blues, so we decided to go there. It was Memorial Day, so we expected it to be busy, but when we got there they said there was only a 30 min wait. That was definitely not the case though.We sat on some rocks nearby and waited for our buzzer to go off. We waited, and waited, and waited. There were many tables open, which I think was also confusing people that were coming in after us. We waited about 40 minutes and then overheard the hostess telling someone else the buzzers weren't working. So we turned in those. Even though there were a ton of tables open, we weren't allowed to even sit at them to get some drinks or eat chips, etc. We were told that they were pacing the flow of people because the kitchen was backed up, and that was the reason for the empty tables. ??? We were both amazed that we were not even allowed to sit down to get some drinks, it's their money that they lost I guess though.After waiting about 45 - 50 min, we overhear a tablet nearby asking about their food. The waitress tells them the kitchen is really backed up, so their food isn't going to come for about 40 more minutes but she could get them some chips, etc. (They had already been seated and placed their order about 20 min prior) After hearing that, we bailed. I sadly can't even review the food because the wait was so unacceptable, especially since we couldn't even sit down and get water or drinks. When we told the hostess we were just leaving, she didn't seem very apologetic either, all she said was a quick sorry. I really liked to stop at this place and get some lunch when I was riding my bike on the trail, but my boyfriend said he'd never go back."
"4.0","I ate Goat haleem and biryani. The haleem doesn't taste like the hyderabadi one, but in the US considering it isn't easily available, I am satisfied. The chicken biryani and Bengal special biryani are good."
"1.0","Il Tetto- should be Ewl Tetto. Our first time to Pittsburgh and we stopped here after we left the Mexican place next door (which is so good btw) anyways. Service: well you better hope not to get Olivia  she was horrible. She could care less, was so rude, and at the end threw our check (literally threw) read my other reviews I am super honest. She threw it and said have a good day. Ugh, Olivia happy Friday to you. I get people have bad days but common. Now on to the drinks, HORRIBLE. Not sure worth the money."
"4.0","Went to Pittsburgh recently and this place is a cute gem tucked away on a busy street in either shady side or squirrel hill. It not only feels vintage inside, but they also only accept cash, giving it an older kind of vibe. The staff were friendly, but not in that overbearing sort of way. Very refreshing! They are very laid back, but still make sure you get what you want. I ordered the chorizo hash and it was quite a lot of food! I ate it all of course, and I don't even regret it. Even if I could hardly move for a few hours following :P The eggs were cooked perfectly (over easy) and the broken yolk tasted great on top of the chorizo and hash browns. Definitely a great place for hangover food! The entire meal with two entrees, a side of bacon, chocolate milk, and coffee was only $30. Compared to San Diego prices, I found this to be amazing! Hit it up if you ever find yourself in Pittsburgh!"
"4.0","I LOVE Bruegger's Bagels.  I wish they would come to Chicago.  Regardless of the time of day, I order the same thing, the turkey sandwich with garlic cream cheese and dried tomato spread.  So good, I wish I had one right now.  My cousins thought I was odd for wanting to come here, but I told him to take a bite of my sandwich and yes, indeed, he did agree, it was good.  Friendly service and spacious seating all added to another great Bruegger's experience."

"4.0","This gem is pretty close to work so i was able to check it out for lunch with a couple of my work mates. There were 6 people in my party and they were able to seat us immediately ...it was also 1230pm.   The place is small and intimate. Cute decor and very homey.  They have a simple no fuss italian menu.  Appetizers, sandwiches and bigger meals. Its BYOB. They had one vegetarian salad, one vegetarian wrap and entree. Our waiter was a bit dull and even maybe hangover?? very blah demeanor.  He also wasn't familiar with some of the items on the menu. i.e the salad of the day. However this was quickly redeemed by their white bean/olive oil vinaigrette dip that comes with the basket of bread. OMG delish i probably ate too much. It had the perfect kick and a great way to get the tummy ready for the entree.  I ordered the  lemon goat cheese ravioli with asparagus and it was delicious. A bit more cheesier than i expected but still extremely flavourful the asparagus was probably my favourite item on the plate. Fresh and not too raw or over cooked. The serving was big and i got to have some leftovers for dinner.One of  My meat eating friends got the chicken sandwich that shes still talking about. My glass of water was refilled frequently and so was my friends' ice teas. We also got our checks pretty quickly.  A+ for the fast service. Other than the lack of enthusiasm for life from our waiter, I thought this place was great. The lunch prices are also very reasonable. $11 for my ravioli and about 9/10 for sandwiches. At the end of the meal the chef came out to see how we liked our meals and he was cute and friendly thus adding one more star to this review. If you work in Bloomfield or shadyside this is a great place to check out for lunch. We were there for about 45 minutes and with the fast service you will be able to enjoy an amazing meal without getting on the boss's shit list."
"4.0","We had some egg rolls, Chicken Chow Mein and General Tso's dinners.  The chicken chow mein came in a small and large size option which was nice.  We were ordering late after a Pirates game.The food was average, but good.  However, i gave them a 4th star because we didnt get to order until 1045 pm.  They close at 11... but they delivered to our hotel anyway.  We got it around 1120 pm and it was VERY hot still.  We would get it again."
"5.0","Everything about this place rocks! Excellent food and good service. Definitely get the pancakes."
"5.0","We had a wait at FatHeads down the street, so walked over to Delanie's. Pleasant experience with the 'better than Starbucks' hot chocolate as stated by my 12 year old. Three drinks under $10, great music, visit with the locals, and smells of deliciousness. Will be back."
"1.0","We were visiting the city...walked into the restaurant at 10:30 on a Friday night and were turned away because the hostess quite obviously wanted to go home soon..very rude and will not be going back..too bad."
"5.0","I highly recommend Mezzo!  The entire wait staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and timely.  I had Le Genovese - there aren't enough positive adjectives to describe this dish.  Savory, flavorful, tender... I could go on & on.  Bravo, Mezzo!"
"5.0","This is a nice place , when you walk in you have to go downstairs!   The menu features cheese sandwiches made many ways!  Some have Mac n cheese in them.  I had the standard cheese sandwich added bacon it was a good cheese sandwich!  It came with tomato soup, I thought it was ok , but it didn't taste like the tomato soup that I'm used Too!  On the weekend during brunch time they have all you can drink bloody Mary's and Mimosas!  I'd love to go back and try there pancakes they look so good!   The waiter was very nice and gave us good service!"
"5.0","'It's no Cracker Barrel,'I said to my wife as she suggested we eat at the newest, soon to be hot spot simply because it's good and everyone will eventually know. '... And they may be so green that the staff isn't developed, and FOH personalities don't yet exist. Surely we should wait until they're established until we go there.''Don't call me Shirley!'And she was right. Her name isn't Shirley. It was ok to eat here, even if today WAS my yearly lap completion day. I FORCED myself to try all four of the signature cocktails, mostly because they weren't just special, but I didn't have anybody sign ANYTHING, not even once on my visit. Anyhow, the food was good, the service was nominal. And if you think I didn't love every minute of it, you need to reread this review over and over again until you understand sarcasm, or Citizen Kane, whichever comes first. But seriously. Everything about this spot, right in my neighborhood, is fantastic. I genuinely believe that if you've found your way to these Yelp reviews, and you're not looking for bud light-well done naked burghers-house vodka red bulls-wine from a jug, You'll like it here.The beef tongue was unique. The poached apples w/pickled grapes, frisée, and cashews was fantastic. The chicken liver mousse was melt in your mouth good, if a little bit salty-a good thing. The pork tenderloin/pork belly was exactly what it should have been, the lentil salad paired perfectly, and I actually loved the carrots. Lastly the coutlotte, which of course we ordered rare knowing what the cut of meat is, was delicious. As someone who isn't a fan of cauliflower, I found the roasted version served with the meat amazingly delicious. Even though the wife and I drink our dessert, we ordered the lavender pound cake-what a well balanced dessert! As if it was crafted to have flavor profiles and not just attack a sweet tooth. If you want a boring sweet, buy a candy bar, this pound cake has me craving a return visit. Which I hear won't be the same since they exist in the rotational/seasonal availability world. Can't wait!"
"5.0","I loved this place! The service was impeccable - new utensils after every course, crumbs cleaned from table, we were never rushed, food was paced perfectly. Our waiter was Zach and he was wonderful! He knew every answer to our questions, presented the menu well and also took a photo for us. My favorites - the oxtail, the bacalao croquettes and the ribs.  THE RIBS! Can't wait for my next visit!"
"2.0","I've been wanting to try this place for a while. I finally convinced my husband to go and I have to say I was let down. I got the grilled chicken sandwich and he got a burger. The food was ok but not worth it for the price. Beer selection was limited. I did like the plates the food was served on! However, we left there disappointed. About seven hours later I woke up violently I'll and was sick the rest of the evening. Needless to say but we won't be going back."
"5.0","Some of the best food I've ever eaten in Pittsburgh. The staff is always friendly and inviting. The atmosphere is that of an old Victorian house. The whole experience is positively inviting. A must if you're traveling around Oakland or the Shenley area. Can not say enough good things about this restaurant!"
"4.0","Great little pizza joint in the South Side. Small menu, easy ordering. Pizza slices are New York style, thin and crunchy crust. Slices are huge 12' slices. Mine had pepperoni and sausage. You either have to fold it in half or hold it with both hands, and that's pretty much not enough. Great pizza, traditional taste, pepperoni and sausage were tasty, good sauce. Dependable everytime we go, excellent pizza!!!!"
"5.0","best damn tacos in the burgh!!! if you are alive and breathing you need to eat here!!"
"5.0","Had an amazing brunch here with my sister 2 weekends ago. I ordered the veggie omelette and it was absolutely incredible. The portion is just as big as brunch on a Sunday should be, and was served with 2 slices of buttered toast and great mashed home fries. The service was super speedy! We had our meal within about 2 minutes from ordering. Still we never felt rushed. All around fantastic meal."
"2.0","Not the best restaurant to go to if you are vegetarian! I was hoping to try the vegetarian pho but I couldn't be convinced that it was truly vegetarian. I ended up getting the tofu tomato sauce with rice and it was alright. It wasn't the most flavorful thing I've had and it was also a small portion."
"5.0","You get the value for your money, and more. The portion sizes are very generous, and you can make two meals out of one order. The food is not spicy as you would find in an Indian-Pakistani restaurant, but they can cook tandoori chicken for you.The staff is very friendly, caring, and quick with fulfilling your order. The only deductions is for lack of look, but if you are only interested in food, you will be in safe hands."
"2.0","The service was mediocre at best. We first ordered drinks with water for the table. We had to ask our server 3 times for water, the third time after we saw her folding silverware completely oblivious to our request. We ordered chips and salsa, and the chips were stale. As we were eating our tacos (meh I've had better), there was a medium sized bug crawling on the wall near our table. She gave us a discount, probably due to the bug but wouldn't go back there again."
"1.0","Dear Redfin Blues,I can't begin to express my disappointment in your establishment. Such high expectations were set when we were greeted at the host stand and sent of for cocktails on a 20 min wait list (which apparently never existed). After 30 mins and seeing literally 4 parties that noticeably came in after us be seated, I reminded the host who directed us to the bar that we were still waiting. After 20 more minutes and 2 more parties getting sat (one who sat themselves) I approached a blonde woman seating and cleaning tables to let her know that we could be removed from the 'list'. To which she replied 'what list?' And didn't even bother to apologize... nothing was offered to assist us in our search for sustenance nor was there anything offered for our inconvenience. Fortunately, for us, the disaster at your restaurant lead us to discover a new place, that we have decided to frequent. So, thank you for f**king up."
"4.0","Sushi Fuku is heaven for someone who loves sushi but gets a little picky with their sushi choices. They have options between sushi rolls, 'burritos', and bowls. A typical order consists of 1 protein, 4 veggies/misc, and 2 toppings/sauces. They also have the option for soy wraps and brown rice, which is great if I'm feeling the need to be healthy. My issue with this place is that it's insanely tiny and has like 2 seats, inevitability making it a takeout place. It's even awkward to stand in line sometimes. If you're for nicer ambience - go to their first location in Oakland (quality between the two is pretty identical).Make sure when you visit to download FiveStars and join their rewards program. Occasionally they send out coupons like 'free extra protein' and 12 points gets you a free sushi roll/burrito/bowl!"
"4.0","Aside from a rather rank men's restroom that assumes you'll only have to relieve your bladder and not your bowels (there's no sit-down commode), I did not find Original Oyster House to be the poorly-serviced dirthole with middling food it is being made out to be.OOH (how's that for an acronym?) has been one of those establishments I'd been meaning to visit for most of my life but just never got around to frequenting until Saturday's Occupy Pittsburgh march brought us to Market Square, giving Kay and I the perfect excuse to stop in. We both went for the Make it Your Way Seafood Platter, which goes choose-1-choose-2-choose-1 on ya, granting the big-eyed diner the chance to sample a shipload of menu items for under $10. You know I got the oysters, 2 lightly breaded ones to be exact, and they were as juicy, sea-salty, and deliciously slimy as they are supposed to be. A crab cake came next, and my only complaint about it was that it was slightly lacking in the crabmeat. Other than that, I found it to be a lip-smacker. I substituted a cup of the clam chowder for one side and a buck extra without looking back. The clam chunks were ample, the potato cubes yielded to the teeth beautifully, and the broth was creamy, buttery, ambrosial.  The Beer-Battered Fish Nuggets, however, shockingly stole the show, knocking the oysters from the stage to headline. The 3 gigantic cubes of fish (cod?) encased in a bronze jacket of yeasty, ale-imbibed bronze were saved for last so as to savor their innate succulence sans any sauce or condiment. Not being able to resist and not having had one in a decade during a takeout meal, I had the Original Oyster. This isn't so much a breaded oyster as it is a fried, fat, starchy, elliptical biscuit that has an oyster in it...somewhere. It's not for everyone, and I'm not sure it's even my thing being that I like to actually taste the oyster, but it is a memorable novelty. Although, to avoid potential disappointment, I recommend sticking with the lightly breaded oysters (look for them on the menu). Perhaps my roots are talking, but I instinctively knew I'd feel at home in this scrappy hangout despite what I'd heard and read, finding the swell dumb-waiter and welcoming, aged interiors anything but bleak. No, on this sunny, encouraging Saturday, OOH was alive with friendly chatter and a varied clientele. As it is with Primanti's, the help is pressured due to the volume of traffic and are not grouchy. To the contrary, considering how busy OOH gets, I found the entire staff to be pretty jovial, so much so that I gave more than a 20% tip to our harried server, getting a smile and an excited 'Thanks hon!' from her in return. Hey, she's one of the 99% too, y'know? God love her. Then again, the reputedly crabby older ladies always end up taking a shine to me for whatever reason, and that's been the case for as long as I've been alive. OOH is...'real'. Not everyone likes that.  I do. Maybe that's why OOH liked me."
"2.0","This place has really gone downhill. A few years ago this used to be a solid restaurant, but not anymore. The chips are flavorless, the tomato soup tastes like it's from a can, and the service is ridiculously slow. I have some friends that still love their burgers so I find myself still coming here once in awhile, but there are much better options. If you want a good draft list and good food, I would recommend Urban Tap."
"2.0","Not my favorite. They were kind of expensive for what you get. Nothing wrong with 'thin pizza'.... Unless you're chewing more of your own teeth then the pizza itself. The crust is too light. I swear they bought it at Aldi.Taste OK, though... ish.... Nope! Not pleased"
"4.0","This is a great place to go to for a lunch break or a quick dinner. You will be in and out in less than 5 minutes with a perfectly tasty sub and sandwich. I have always ordered the #5 which is named the Vito. It is a classic Italian sandwich and I always get it with hot peppers, which you have to specify during your order. It fills you up perfectly, the food tastes good, the service is beyond quick and it is affordable. So there is not much more to ask for when it comes to Jimmy John's. Also, they deliver so that is an extra plus."
"4.0","Just stopped for happy hour at the bar. Very good selection of food and drink at happy hour pricing. Six Gyoza for $4, salt and pepper tofu for $3? All good. Only downside was one bartender which created considerable wait to order and reorder."
"5.0","Came for take out, even after reading the reviews. I never bypass a chance for gluten free pizza. We found all of the things coming up as negative resolved. My daughter and I each had our own 'pizza maker', and both of them were friendly and proficient. And changed their gloves frequently. Pizza was very good (We both went with a design your own) And the gluten free was even good cold the next day, a real rarity. I definitely felt they took the service critique to heart, and I'd happily return."
"5.0","If you are looking for something light and healthy for lunch and and need a quick option, this is your place. Efficient, delicious, and all the salad fixings are crisp and fresh. TWO THUMBS UP!"
"5.0","Went to the capital Grille last night. Service there is really good and food is also excellent. ordered the medium well steak which is delicious."
"5.0","Please for the love of all that it is holy and awesome - order the broccoli rabe. THE BEST SANDWICH I've ever eaten really!"
"5.0","The ramen, the cocktail, the ambience. A+, Umami. I dined at the bar solo on a Friday night and was pleased at how lively this restaurant was thanks to the fact that a live DJ was in house. When in Pittsburgh, definitely make an appearance at Umami."
"5.0","Loved this place. We got here shortly after 9 so we were able to get a table right away. I got the mushroom omelet and it was seriously the best omelet I have ever eaten in my life. My only complaint is the food took awhile to come to the table but it was well worth the wait. Thought the place was moderately priced. Will definitely be back."
"3.0","Not necessarily your traditional Peruvian food establishment, but the food is quite tasty and reasonably priced.  I had the empanadas (spicy beef and spinach & feta), they were quite good.  There are also at least 2 vegetarian dishes on special daily.  They additionally have tonz of beautiful Peruvian art for sale here.  Not exactly the cheapest, but very fine craftmanship.  Definitely will be back."
"3.0","I've eaten here a few times now, and this review is really intended to kind of cover each experience, hence the three star rating. Now, the food here is usually pretty good, and it's a fun place to watch a game. The location really is top notch as well. The biggest issue here really is, as one reviewer put it below, the service. Even when the place isn't slammed, the service staff are fairly lackadaisical in checking in on you, and there was one instance where I was seated at a dirty table.Now, the thing about this place is, even with the inconsistent service, for the location, the prices and the food are really good. If they could really buckle down on servers, they'd be an amazing place to stop."
"5.0","This was a pleasant surprise, wasn't aware of this place until my daughter took me. It was a great location, right on the river, the place was very comfortable. The food was excellent from the appetizers thru the main course. The waitress was friendly and attentive. Will be visiting this establishment often."
"2.0","I've gotten Rialto delivered a few times, and it seems to get worse each time. Tonight, on a very not busy Sunday, I received ice cold fried mushrooms and a pizza that looked like it had been tossed around and stepped on (all of the toppings and cheese had slid off, and the dough was smashed up against the opposite corner of the box). They're nearby and convenient, so I've been giving them second and third chances, but I'm officially done ordering from here."
"4.0","Very cute restaurant. Went with my mother over the summer after just moving to Pittsburgh. She had the ravioli, I had the linguine with clams. Overall the setting is very charming--a small space with sunflower decorations all over. Each entree comes with a sizeable salad, which is nice. Regarding the entrees, the ravioli was awesome. My linguine was nice as well but seemed to have chopped canned clams rather than fresh ones, which was a little strange. Overall I would come back and eat more ravioli!"
"5.0","Holy cow are my taste buds tired! A fine establishment nestled in a wonderful neighborhood. After watching Andy Warhol eat a hamburger at the museum and purchasing 5 new aprons from Williams and Sonoma (new year, new me!), it was safe to say that I had worked up quite an appetite.The lemon water that our server brought out was delicious and very flavorful. I had to watch myself, almost filled up on water.I chose a philly cheese type of grilled cheese..did I mention they have 28 different types? The philly cheese was just what the doctor ordered to combat my hunger, in addition to the succulent soup and zesty Cajun fries.This place is a gem and I plan on returning to Pittsburgh all of February and sample all 28 in 28 days. Easy 5 stars plus I'll give them 5 slices of cheese making this my favorite place of all time! Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"1.0","I ordered chicken lo mein and it came with no chicken AND NO JOKE there was a duck sauce packet sitting in the bottom of my container of noodles. Picking a plastic sauce packet out of my meal was foul and they messed up the order??? DO NOT EAT HERE"
"5.0","Best taco's I've had in in pittsburgh (so far, anyways). Better than the extremely overrated and overpriced tako. Better than la palapa (way cooler vibe, as well). Even better than Las Palmas imo (although it's close). They are friendly, the decor is awesome, there are tons of rare pops, they take cards, food is super cheap and extremely tasty. Can't wait to return."
"1.0","Unfortunately this dominos is the only one close to me, and their service is absolutely horrendous. Their tracker will tell me my pizza is on the way and the. 45 minutes later say it just went in the oven. One of the delivery drivers verbally attacked me because I didn't provide him the tip he thought he deserved- after doing the bare minimum- (the tip was 20%). I can't wait to move out of this domino's zone!"
"3.0","I have been to two capital grille restaurants. The one in king of Prussia is the best service I have ever gotten from any restaurant anywhere! And not just once! Every time I go the food and service is beyond compare. Lobster Mac n cheese is amazing!The one in Pittsburgh has decent food and the service is okay but it isn't anything to write home about. I would rather go elsewhere."
"4.0","My friend from Spain told me that this not the authentic Spain Culinary but most of dishes tastes food despite of the fact some recipes are not originally from Spain. I also like their service and their atmosphere with candlelight."
"5.0","I finally experienced Caffe Mona. We went with a group of 4 on a wednesday morning. As good as it gets.Also one of the brunch places where everything this perfect. They have many savory options.We ordered Buttermilk Caramel Pancakes, Veggie Omelette and Berries French Toast. The pancakes are very fluffy and ligth. By the end of our meal, we were full as well as content with what we ate. Definitely visit if you are looking for exciting brunch options.They are SO goood, BTW highly, highly recommend the Berries French Toast."
"5.0","Having read some of the reviews I was cautious about eating at the Coca Cafe.  However,  I went anyway and proved once again that you can't trust the internet. Whatever problems there were in the past have been corrected. The service was great!   Every person that works there that I came in contact with were pleasent and made the experience fun. The food was amazing!  It's made fresh and portions are filling. If you're used to 15 minute lunches...go back to McDonald's!!!  Coca has a euro feel to its pace. It's not rushed at all. TIP if you want to avoid a wait try 1pm. I love this place and will return often."
"5.0","If you want the freshest, highest quality Arabic/Indian food in the city, go to Salem's in the Strip District.  Walk down the line of food and select what you want from a variety of chicken, lamb, vegetables, and rice.  I honestly feel Salem's gets better each time I go and I assure you, I've been there a lot. I frequented the original location in Oakland for many years until they closed it and built the 'new' one.  The food and service is outstanding.  The market next door is equally as impressive.  They carry the best pita bread in the universe - Pitaland.  The interior seating isn't suitable for a 'fancy' dinner so I wouldn't recommend bringing a first date here but if you can get past that, which you should, Salem's is a MUST."
"3.0","Apollo Cafe is still a solid, unpretentious place to get a decent lunch.  I met up here with a friend of mine this past week. I opted for my usual soup & half a sandwich combo.  Now my ham sandwich was good, but that Greek lemon with rice soup was o-so heavenly.  Their menu is right--their soups are almost meals unto themselves!I don' remember what Lisa had for her lunch, but we did share an order of carrot cake for dessert.  Yum!"
"5.0","I was in town with my daughter to tour a couple schools the 68 degree weather made it nearly impossible to get a table around 7.   Not only did they seat us but the manager took the time to engage with my daughter ask what we were doing in town.  The waitress was great and the special 'veal chop' was outstanding I am glad that Morton's, McCormick's and the Capital Grille could not find us a table.  I guess it gave us another 30 minutes to chat about school."
"5.0","This has become one of my favorite spots in the city. My favorite is the lamb gyro. The price is great and the amount of meat they give you is fantastic. The pita is fresh and it is packed with goodness. I also really love rice. They have some really great rice that is always cooked to perfection. They will even let you out some sauce from a dish on top at no extra cost. They offer free pita and fried pita with your order. I came during Ramadan for the buffet and was also fantastic. The customer service is what customer service should be. I'm happy that I found this place. It always makes me happy to see different people from different walks of life coming together to break bread."
"1.0","It's unfair to give this establishment a one star, but a one star I must. Why? not because of the food, we ate there once and I don't recall anything not tasting fine. But we tried to eat there for a second time, with a reservation mind you, but we might as well not had one, because not only we waited, we were eventually relegated to the kitchen table in the back hallway where there is no space and noisy as hell and impossible to enjoy a fine dining experience. Please understand that we have experienced fine dining in some of the best restaurants in the country!This brings me to the reason why this establishment deserves a one rating, failure to fix an ongoing issue that is crystal clear in the unsatisfied category of reviews in yelp. What this restaurant has going for it, it's a small fish in a pond, thus it has few to little competition, if it were in a big city like NY, LA or SF it would not survive the mismanagement. That being the failure to either expand the restaurant or restrict reservations by limiting the number of guests and not having to pinball clients to either ignore reservations or placement just because of the size of the establishment. Ignoring committed reservations is fatal and placement in less than desirable space speaks poorly of management.I have seen and even met the owner and he is an absolutely amazing and delightful person, though the difficulty to keep everyone happy has perhaps impacted his demeanor in a negative way at times. He has built an amazing restaurant but he is going to lose a few clients here and there because he may not care to correct an obvious recurring issue! Lack of space. Best Wishes!"
"5.0","What a great neighbourhood joint!  I can't speak to the food as we stopped there after dinner - but parked ourselves at the bar to watch a baseball game and have a few drinks. We were visiting Pittsburgh from California, and popped in on our way back to the hotel. Owner Brian Carey mans the bar and keeps the casual atmosphere going with lighthearted banter. Stick around long enough and you will meet staff and owners from other local waterholes, or maybe even your local councilman. It's a great little place w/irish pub ambiance. Make sure to pop your head in for a drink or two on a Thursday night - you never know who might show up - like the Bud guy or the Jagermeister girls - it's a busy place, and a lot of fun, w/great staff and an owner who cares - this is as close to CHEERS as you'll ever get"
"5.0","Best place for lunch in Pittsburgh! Gorgeous patio, remarkable service and people, delicious food and drinks all to the sound of a beautiful fountain. I'll be back!"
"1.0","I have never written a review before, but after our experience last night I was compelled to share it. It was a total disaster and the worst dining experience that I have ever had. Anything that could go wrong, did.  We waited three hours wait to be seated and served. When the food finally arrived, nearly all of the orders were wrong and the food was cold.  We had three orders that didn't arrive at all. One person ordered the kale salad - spinach was served instead with no explanation. One person ordered a pulled pork sandwich, only to be told they were out of pork - not at the time of ordering but instead  nearly two hours later when the other orders were being served. Fish tacos came in lieu of fish and chips, three burgers were presented, but the servers couldn't identify the differences between the orders.  The scene was incredible and we asked to talk to the manager. She was calm, as were we, but she wasn't incompetent able to problem-solve or explain what was happening. The manager and severs were embarrassed and abandoned our table for the rest of the night.The night was a total disaster. Don't go! So many better restaurants in Pittsburgh."
"3.0","I got the buttermilk and woah - I feel like someone played a trick on me! I could barely drink a quarter inch of that stuff until I felt my lactose intolerance crunching me. The fish fry was good, though I would save the fish fry stomach for Wholey's next time. This place is 3 rooms in 1. The southernmost is a bar, which would have been fun to discover before I found the ordering and dining room. The best part about the 3 rooms might be the spiced vinegar sauce. I load that stuff on.  The staff was incredible in their efficiency and intolerance. Lovely too. I love that Pitt gruff."
"4.0","One of the better food stops on Craig street. You can create you own bowl, sushi roll, or sushi burrito, or you can choose from one of their preset options. They have a good selection of toppings (including tofu, salmon, spicy crab etc. for proteins). I particularly like how they have seaweed, edamame, and inari as 'veggies'.I've never seen too much of a line here, and I've always been able to find seating.Don't expect life changingly delicious food, but this place is great for a quick lunch or dinner that's not too expensive."
"1.0","I am allergic to eggs and even after mentioning it several times to the waitress, she didn't took it seriously. Not even once but this happened thrice and when the fourth time I ordered Eggplant Parmesan, they revealed we always put eggs in it. Why the hell you didn't listen to my concern correctly and take the order seriously since last three times.I never give one star to any restaurant, but not even a single thing I could find nice in this restaurant. I will never visit this place again.This is not a restaurant actually, it looks like somebody's home and there is only one cook who takes hours to prepare a single dish."
"5.0","OMG THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! Okay, the ambiance is cutesy and romantic. Upon arrival you are given a bread basket with HUGE Texas sized bread. I wasn't such a big fan because it was so soft that it seems to deteriorate while holding it. Little too messy for my liking. The bruschetta was not your typical bruschetta and honestly I would not recommend it. The Caesar salad is really a pity. Although it looks like a Caesar salad it doesn't taste like one since the lettuce, croutons, and dressing are all so flimsy. It hardly tasted like anything. So why am I giving this place a 5 star review? Because the pasta is amazing! The best pasta I have ever had! Now I know why people with Italian mothers/grandmothers scoff at places like Olive Garden where they don't make their own noodles. What a difference it makes. The menu offers you a large selection of noodles (gluten free available) and sauces to choose from. I had the marfredo (mix of marinara and alfredo) and I was dying over how good it was. My girlfriend, who has an Italian family, had the aglio aoli (sp?) and she was also dying over how amazing this was. DO COME HERE but don't waste any of your time with the appetizers or bread. Save your appetite for the pasta! I didn't get to try the deserts but next time I want to try their tiramisu since all the deserts are also made on site."
"1.0","Unfortunately, I can't give zero stars for this place!Sticky table, lousy, slow service, meh food. The only thing good was joking about how bad it was afterward. Only three of the four of us got their food.... but no silverware. We were told that the missing food would be five minutes.... lol... we were already done our meals and check on the table .... waiting for the boxed meal ( my friend had given up and left ). They obviously hadn't bothered to prepare his meal.I think to top things off, we never got a visit from a manager.In addition to the bad food and lousy service, I was overcharged on my credit card, luckily I resolved the issue through my card service. With all the choices available on the North Shore... I certainly won't go back to this dump"
"1.0","The worst. I got the roast beef. Very dry almost inedible very salty meat. They must make the sandwich ahead and it sits and dries out. Never again. My fault for thinking this was a good idea. I threw half of the sandwich out. There are other options at the ballpark so I'll never try this Primanti's again."
"5.0","Great food and great prices, love it! The people & staff were so awesome & it's super pet friendly! Love it, it's the best"
"4.0","Tamarind is usually a very good Indian restaurant, set cozily on the first floor of a house.  The dinner options are excellent, if a bit on the pricier side for the students they typically attract (the fact that it's usually full of students anyway is a testament to the quality and consistency).  Sauces are creamy and flavorful, while chunks of meat are tender and sizable.The one caveat: during lunch, you can only get the buffet (no individual ordering)--and on weekdays, the buffet is a little below average at best.  Avoid lunches Monday through Friday and you'll do just fine."
"4.0","Incredible pancakes at a reasonable price! Decent coffee as well. Good selection for vegetarians."
"1.0","Most of the existing reviews are pretty spot-on, so I'm not sure this adds anything very useful. But I think this experience nicely sums up what you can expect at Coco Cafe... We used app to book, seated late by 20min... No server for ~15 min. Dirty cups for drinks... About 45 min after putting our order in, we started to wonder where our food was. We then looked around and noticed that no other tables had food either. Many tables had no cutlery, water, or coffee. For a while, there was no staff present on the restaurant floor. One large group gave up and left. At this point, we started looking around for hidden cameras in case this was some prank TV show testing how long we would just sit there... 45 min later, our food was served. Food was fine. Unfortunately, no cameras or TV host appeared. We tried to warn a couple who were still waiting outside, but I don't think they listened."
"5.0","I'm new to the area and I am so glad I ventured into this establishment! The waiter was personable and timely, the food was prepared and served hot and was absolutely a m a z i n g. I 100% endorse visiting this facility as I will definitely be returning!"
"4.0","Big space with a ton of t.v's and a ton of beer options. Great place to have a happy hour or watch the game. Not to be petty buttttt, we ordered shrimp tacos about 10 minutes before the couple next to us and their tacos came out about 10 minutes before us. So, a slight mix up. No biggy. Then as we were eating our tacos, a second order of tacos came out by mistake. So they are still working some kinks out.That said, tacos were good.  Menu was a lot of just fried type bar foods mostly.  So overall, a good spot for a drink and some apps but I wouldn't suggest going here for a dinner.  If I could give 3.5 stars, that's what I'd do."
"1.0","2/10 pizza.1/10 calzones. Would be passable as food if everything was 75% cheaper. Service was mediocre at best. Legitimately 15-20 other pizza/sub shops in the area that far surpass this dinky place. I do not know any reason I would ever think about coming back to 'little Nipper's'."
"5.0","The food is great. Very expensive but that's what you are opting in when you book in a 5 star restaurant. Had the ribeye and the tenderloin with lobster. The balsamic vinegar cost on the ribeye was the highlight of the dinner. Lobster bisque was fantastic but when has lobster bisque ever not be :)"
"4.0","I've been wanting to stop in here for the last few months since I go to a hair salon across the street. I finally managed to go on a Thursday afternoon about 2:15pm. Since it was off peak, there were only a few tables with guests & no one at the bar. I sat at the bar since I was alone. I was asked if I had any questions about the beer & didn't realize they brewed their own & had a restaurant (and their brewery) in Zelienople, who knew? They gave me a taste (a rather large taste I might add in these cute tiny Pilsner glasses) of their ale & IPA and both were delicious. I ordered the Maggie's Farm burger which came with Gouda, horseradish, carmelized onions, roasted chilies & rum aioli. You could really tell that it was a fresh made burger & the horseradish & chilies gave it a good kick. The bun was soft, and the fries were fresh cut & plentiful. They also have rosemary fries for $1 more. I look forward to visiting their Zelienople location soon & was told they plan to expand to the old Mellon Bank Building on Main St & will eventually have a rooftop deck!Returned early June: On Thursdays they have $4 house wine by the glass all day. Red is a Merlot, White is a Pinot Grigio. I choose the white & it was a nice dry not too fruity wine that was perfect for 4 bucks. I chose the Fox Chapel which features 'the blend' which is a combo of beef & mushrooms in the burger, plus goat cheese, greens, onion, avocado & balsamic. It came with a lot of hand cut fries. The burgers remind me of one you'd make yourself at home. Not fancy or huge, but tasty & just enough. It's worth a stop for a burger. Returned again Oct 25, 2018: Sorry to report that this time I left without ever getting even a drink! Why? I must have been invisible. After giving Burgh'ers 5 stars twice I felt obligated to let management know that even if servers are busy they should always acknowledge a customer's presence. This was an off peak time, 2:15pm on a Thursday. I had 45 minutes to grab lunch before an appointment. I sat at the bar. There were 2 tables & one other couple at the bar. There was a woman who evidently worked there sitting at the bar working on a laptop near kitchen. There was one male server working the bar & tables. Both the woman & man appeared behind the bar twice. But I sat at the bar for 12 minutes. No one made eye contact or acknowledged I was there. Ridiculous. So I left. If this had been my first visit I'd give zero stars. But since I had 2 previously good visits I am just taking one star away & saying Burgh'ers please improve your customer service!"
"5.0","We have been here numerous times, and have never been disappointed. Always a wide range of beers and ciders, as well as yummy grilled cheese options. Mike D was our server tonight, and he was excellent! Super friendly and was giving us suggestions on what to try. Highly recommend!"
"5.0","The burgers here are delicious and well worth the price!! We got the Shadyside burger and the Fox chapel burgers and they were both tasty. The Fox chapel burger was less heavy than the Shadyside burger and when paired with the salad, it didn't put me in the post-thanksgiving-meal comma as burgers usually do. Great place overall."
"1.0","Went there yesterday after a day boating.  Peel and eat shrimp were dry and tough, not fresh.  Ordered crab cakes, they were dry and the crab tasted old as well.  Might be good for a place to have drinks, but their overpriced old food was not enjoyable. Will not be returning."
"5.0","The ladies who waited on me were so friendly. They do many options for bubble drinks and great bubble smoothies. I will have to come back for their chicken."
"4.0","A really solid lunch place downtown, especially when you're not trying to kill the days calories. Have had a time or two though where my online order just never showed up. But they fix it right away as soon as you mention it. I love the variety of either a salad, rice bowl, or noodle bowl."
"5.0","Lunch at Salem's is excellent.  I have always got my fix of authentic arab/mediteranian food from their original location in Oakland.  This location is MUCH,  MUCH better!   There is parking.   It is impecably clean.   The space is huge.   The food is more varied and tastes great!  The service is way above any cafetria syle restaurant!   It is definately a place that makes you feel like you belong.....no matter who you are!If you like mediteranian, indian-style food....you have to try it here.   It tastes great, feels real, and is inexpensive!"
"2.0","I walked in, staff looked at me and didn't greet or acknowledged me. I waited as one of the staff stood near the cash register and did not make eye contact. Finally someone who was preparing food asked what I needed. I think people forget what customer service is and it shows in the lack of care in how they treat customers, especially first timers. Maybe it was just me...Positive is that the food was done in advance."
"4.0","Was super excited to try this new addition on Forbes Ave. The lunch hour gets super busy, but the line does move quickly. The decor of this place makes it seem nicer than your typical fried food joint. I had the chicken sandwich with fries at a medium level heat. My friend had the hot level and she said it was pretty spicy. Our food came out pretty quickly. The sandwich was HUGE. I am glad, because definitely on the higher end of prices for essentially fast food. The chicken was juicy and crispy and had a nice blend of spices on it. The medium was perfect for me. It had some heat, but did not overpower the chicken. The crinkle cut fries went well with the dipping sauce which was a combo of ketchup, mayo, and spices. Overall, a welcome addition to Oakland. A great place to go if you are craving some fried chicken!"
"2.0","Honestly the food here is...well...yucky. I've gotten delivery several times because sometimes I get a hankering for quick, cheap, indian food and am always disappointed. Every entree i've gotten has come with an entire INCH of grease pooled at the top! So gross. Will not order from here again."
"5.0","Amazing! Loved the chicken liver mousse, scallops and popcorn dessert!  Drinks and service were great!!"
"4.0","Love that they have cold-brew coffee. Not many coffee shops in Pittsburgh have this option. They have the small local coffee shop feel as well, I'm not sure if they use any organic ingredients, but I hope they do :).  I will be back for sure!"
"5.0","The food here is amazing!  I work nearby and come here at least once a week.  Even if you're not adventurous enough to try some of their Mediterranean dishes they have the most amazing burger!"
"3.0","Was looking forward to a trip to Mezzo as Sienna on the Square is one of my fav Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh and this is essentially a sister. The service started out poor and continued throughout. Based on my observation it appeared they were understaffed for the crowd as our waiter had numerous tables. We were going in advance of a show and after we waited 22 minutes to get our waiter's attention after our reservation/seating time, we were finally able to order drinks for the table, along with food. My husband and I arrived earlier than the other couple and he ordered a drink which took nearly 15 minutes.  We made it clear to our waiter that we were going to an 8pm show so after waiting 22 minutes for any attention, we'd need to be accommodated. We were quickly told too bad and that everyone in the restaurant was going to the show. We finally received our entrees at 7:46pm (or reservation was at 6:30) which meant we were forced to shovel the food into our mouths. It was a damn shame because we all agreed our dishes were outstanding. This is the only reason they received any stars. Kuddos to the kitchen. Front of house needs to get their act together. I don't think this was the fault of our waiter but poor management of the wait staff. The wait staff were working their tails off for basically a bunch of unhappy people."
"5.0","Stopped in with a co-worker on a recommendation from a bartender on the north shore. We were working as photographers up at the Tough Mudder in Slippery Rock this weekend, and the event put us up in a hotel in Cranberry. Neither of us had been to Pittsburgh before, and we had driven out from Maine for this job, so we decided to use Sunday afternoon to explore downtown, not having any idea what to expect. I was told by many people that we HAD to get up on Mt. Washington just to see the view of the skyline, if nothing else. While having beers at a bar over by PNC Park, I asked the bartender where to get dinner, and he said we needed to get into The Summit...so we did, and what a great decision that was. Absolutely everything about the place was awesome. Extremely friendly and conversational staff, fantastic cocktail menu, and the food was incredible! Highly recommend the smoked gouda mac & cheese. That, along with the mixed olives and a couple of cocktails was one of the best meals I've had in a long time! If you're visiting Pittsburgh, get up to Mt. Washington, check out the view (especially after dark), and get dinner or even just drinks at The Summit!"
"3.0","I  would not have written a review for this place if it did not just the other day provide me with the best steak salad I have had in Pittsburgh. It was a fccukdng good steak salad. Seriously. I want it right now. I have had the nachos, meh, the tacos, meh but the steak salad people, is something not to be missed. Also, for everyone who has driven passed this place and assumed it to be a total dive on the inside, it actually has a nice cruise-ship like atmosphere complete with a stage and mirrors in an almost formal dining room. Who whouldda knew?"
"5.0","All I can say is: wow. This place is delicious. She had the Sopa de Mariscos, I had the Garbonzo en Piperede. Appetizers were the oysters and the roasted pepper conserva.  Really, the flavor palates could not have been more divergent, especially the sopa and garbonzo dish (which was reminiscent of N African). But all of it was fabulous. Her sopa was perhaps the best fish stew I've ever had.  It was better than my choice, but I'd definitely get all of it again."
"4.0","This was a very unique option for dinner.  The mercato has 2 different restaurants and a beer garden on the roof.  We started there with a cold beer on a warm night and it just seemed right.  I loved the open air venue that was hopping, but not too loud and crowded.  We then popped into Mezzo, their second level restaurant for dinner.  We had a great charcuterie board and a local farmers cheese board.  Don't let the name 'farmers cheese' fool you.  There was a great variety of cheese from mild to strong and soft to hard.  For dinner we each had a pizza.  The bacon and egg was really unique and pretty tasty, though I would have preferred this as a breakfast pizza.  I had the quattro formaggi pizza that I thought was very good.  The place was completely full and that might have had something to do with our rather slow service.  Still it is a place I would return to."
"5.0","Excellent Authentic Indian food!!Very good service & nice ambiance.."
"4.0","I ordered my meal to takeout so I cannot speak to the eat in experience. My food was delicious. However, the server left me alone with my check when I picked it up, not saying good night or anything. It was odd, especially given the restaurant was practically empty on the Tuesday night I went and there was another server."
"4.0","The old standby for takeout food at lunchtime, $9 gets you all you need. Very fast and good."
"2.0","Eatable, but far from amazing Indian food (which is however better than what one gets elsewhere in Pittsburgh - which says a lot)."
"4.0","A bit pricey but well worth it. I like sushi but I'm not an aficionado. Kiku's sushi is very well regarded though. My wife and I took a chance on the 8 course chefs choice meal for our anniversary and we were both pleased. Consisted of small plates with tempura, salad, sashimi, cod, octopus and so on. Plus dessert which was aloe vera with berries! For $50 it was a great meal. Not overwhelming and definitely better than the hibachi joints. They take restaurant.com certificates so that will make things more affordable."
"3.0","The wait is way too long as well as getting a drink.but the food is very delicious!!!!! A must appetizer is the pretzels so awesome and not shabby on the drinks by far.  Bartenders are very nice."
"5.0","Update: open & sell six packs on Sundays!  If I could give more than 5 stars I would for this selection & service.  They have great food (even have a veggie dog) and a killer selection of beers.  I was truly impressed to find a good selection of bourbon aged beer (my favorite and it is super difficult to find)."
"4.0","Many happy lunchtimes were spent at this Chick-Fil-A, conveniently located in the basement of the Cathedral of Learning. It was perfect for all of the Summer Language Institute students and is within walking distance from the dorm towers.It is a smaller version of the chain restaurant, but carries almost all of the items on the nation-wide menus. My favorite will always be the little chicken nuggets with waffle fries and extra ranch sauce."
"4.0","Spouse and I wanted lunch while we explored Pittsburgh waiting to catch a ball game.  This place came recommended but a way long wait and not the cleanest place I ever saw - plus tables and people jammed in - we wondered why it would be so popular.  Then we ate the food - fantastic diner grub - the real thing including a gruff but sweet waitress.  We would go back despite the jammed noisy ambience"
"4.0","We originally decided to go to Alexander's for an official dinner for a seminar speaker, expecting 15-20 people to come.  So I talked to the manager and he set me all up, despite the fact that I was calling only 3 days before the dinner.  He was so super nice and wonderful.  We wound up only having 5 (who passes up free food?) but it was still a lovely dinner.  The waitress was really helpful in suggesting the best things to get.  I agree about the bread...it was just 'meh'.  We didn't get an appetizer, but the homemade salad dressing (ranch) was very (very) good.  I got the special for that night - fresh veal, and it was so so so good.  The waitress said it would melt in your mouth, and it did.  I also got the marfredo sauce on malfada pasta as my pasta side, based on other Yelp reviews of this combination and it was also quite good.  Overall, great food.  I would definitely return."
"4.0","Decided to try this place out after passing by it numerous times. The interior is clean and spacious. There's plenty of seating available as well. They have a limited menu and everything is chicken based, duh. I ordered the Chicken sandwich and wanted to try damn hot, since my spice tolerance is pretty good. The cashier cautioned that medium itself can be quite hot and so I decided to go with hot. My verdict - the hot is what I'd consider medium, but I can imagine why they'd be considered hot for others. The sandwich itself was decent and the chicken crispy, would have preferred a better bun. Overall, it was quick and you get a decent quality chicken sandwich and the price is reasonable too. I however was not a fan of their to-go box for the chicken sandwich. The box is meant for nugget like items. The sandwich is quite large and trying to eat it out of the box wasn't the most convenient."
"5.0","Staff is really friendly and welcoming. Sandwich was nothing short of great!!! Fun place for a quick lunch."
"4.0","Color me impressed.  After reserving a table of 10 for a pre-show birthday dinner I started to wonder what had gotten into me.  I was going to pick the meatball joint, but 'no reservations' scared me away.  I didn't really want to go upscale, so Redbeard's seemed to be a good choice.  I started with several $4 Captain and Diet Cokes, so my evening was grrrreat.  But I also enjoyed our spring roll appetizer and my grilled chicken breast w/jalapeno & cheese wing sauce.  The sweet potato waffle fries rounded out a delightful bar meal and our service was overall good.  Keep Redbeard's in mind for a group meal. The upstairs is spacious and has a good vibe. AND they take reservations, which is a welcome change from the many downtown establishments which do not. What's up with that, btw?"
"5.0","Some of the best food we had in Pittsburgh. Small place, informal, but food was very good. As others have noted, big serving sizes (= yummy lunch next day!) and BYOB (corkage fee per person but they don't pour your wine... in which case I think it should be per bottle). This is our current go-to place for celebrations. A little more than we usually pay for a dinner but nice as a treat! They were out of several dishes the night we went, so be sure to check availability if you have a favorite."
"2.0","Went here to get a few coffees and use the bathroom. Was told I couldn't use the bathroom by spending $7 on two coffees, but I could use the bathroom by purchasing a $4 pastry. Obviously, this makes no sense - but I guess you don't count as a customer at Cafe Raymond if you're just buying coffee. Disappointing experience with just okay coffee."
"4.0","Great selection of very reasonably priced pastries and sandwiches. This is the perfect place for a sweet afternoon snack.The chocolate croissant was very flaky and decadent without being greasy. The chocolate was distributed nicely throughout the pastry, so you didn't get a giant mouthful of solid chocolate at once, as often happens with these pastries. I would come early for lunch, though, it seems like they run out of sandwich and lunch items pretty quickly. They also have a frequent diner club where you can earn points and get discounts. Seating is a little limited, but they do have a few cafe tables outside."
"5.0","George was amazing! The venue was packed, in that everyone was waiting for the impending Steeler game.  As soon as we were seated, we were greeted. Our drink order was taken and our appetizers placed with the kitchen. The entire visit mirrored the exceptional service and professionalism exhibited initially. We will most certainly be back. Oh, did I mention that the food was very very good? It was!!?"
"4.0","My wife and I had dinner here on a Saturday evening.Reservations:  We made reservations for 7PM via Opentable.  As we approached 7, we realized that we were going to be late.  We called and the hostess was able to push our reservation back by 30 minutes.  She was incredibly pleasant and professional.Arriving at the Restaurant:  This is going to sound nit-picky but the front door is a bit bizarre.  When you come through the door the hostess is immediately on the left, which promotes some congestion.  As we stood waiting, another couple came to the door.  Because the door opens inward, it was a bit awkward as we were blocking their entrance.  The dark paint and industrial feel is inviting, and there is a long bar is set-up on the left.  The bar seemed comfortable and the spirits are displayed nicely.  I noticed a nice selection of brown-liquor.Waitress: Nice, pleasant, explained the menu items and cocktails well.Cocktails:  Excellent.  I had the Oaxaca Manhattan which was made with mezcal, super good and the smoky flavor of the mezcal worked well with the drink.  My wife had the Maple Sazerac which was also very good.  I was afraid that it was going to be overly sweet, but not the case. Appetizers:  One Excellent, One slightly missed the mark.  Carrot salad: The carrot salad was probably one of the best salads I've had in recent memory.  The carrots were cold but perfectly cooked (not too crunchy, not too soft) the greens were delicious, and the dressing was light but flavorful.  The star of the salad was the chick-pea (i think) fritter.  This was the only part of the salad that was warm, but it worked great with the dish.   Chicken Liver Mousse: We felt a bit let-down by this dish.  The mousse itself was a bit under-seasoned (this is perhaps nit-picking) but the real problem was with the way the mousse was served.  They provide you two large pieces of the most greasy toast you've ever eaten.  I'm no prude, if i ate that toast by itself i'd love it, but it was just too damn rich combining the mousse with the overly buttery toast.  The toast takes away from the mousse instead of letting it be the star.  Admittedly we ate most of the mousse (which was a very large portion - perhaps too much honestly) and had extra toast brought out, but it was just overwhelmingly rich and greasy with the toast.  Entrees: Excellent.Roasted Octopus: I don't know why I worry about ordering octopus because every time i have it it turns out quite good.  The texture was tender, and the white bean puree was a nice sauce.  It was served with some bean fritters and kale greens that were flavorful and soft - likely cooked for a while.  I'd order this again.Tagliatelle: My wife ordered this and only shared with me a small bite but it was quite good.  The pasta was likely fresh-made and the sauce / pork was super tasty.  The dish was fairly rich with a soft egg, and parmesean cheese.  The pasta grabbed the sauce and pork perfectly.  Very good - wish she had shared more.We did not have dessert.Conclusion: This is a good restaurant worthy of a try.  The value for money felt right to me, and aside the toast with the mousse, i can't honestly fault any of the food.  The cocktails were top-notch and the service was very good.  My only concern was that we went on a Saturday night where the weather was nice and yet the restaurant wasn't full - didn't even feel that busy between 7:30 - 8:30.  The bar was mostly empty when we left as-well.   Hopefully it was just a slow night relatively speaking."
"5.0","This place is hands down the best Japanese restaurant in Pittsburgh. It has a calm, relaxed atmosphere, friendly wait staff, and is authentic as you are likely to get this far from the west coast.They offer a wide variety of Japanese dishes. From sushi to sukiyaki to chawanmushi (even takowasa, if you're feeling adventurous).  They offer dishes for less experienced eaters, as well as catering to people looking to try something new. I have never had a bad meal here.I will say it can get pricey, but never unjustifiably so.  Honestly, if you're in the mood for some real Japanese and don't mind spending the extra money for quality, I can't recommend a better place in the city."
"5.0","Wonderful! Creative foods and always pleased with the taste, presentation and quality of food. Grapefruit juice especially was so fresh and amazing. Will definitely be returning. Thanks coca cafe staff!"
"5.0","This one was on our list of must do's! We had 3 late 20's kids with us- last day of their stay we hit peppy's- it's a smalllllll little random sandwich shop in the strip district. You self order and wait for sandwiches on paper- NO FRILLS!! All three guys ordered the # 7 the Ben Rothesburger-- each one took the first bite and literally made a noise of joy followed by OMGOSH this is sooo good! Last Big Win for the kids food experience in Pittsburgh - full and happy as they left for their flight back Cali. Sandwiches are big - bread is amazing no matter what you order, if your on a food journey this is a must for lunch between shopping or early dinner after long day before you go rest -"
"5.0","I went here for lunch with my niece and boyfriend.  There was a little bit of a wait, but they were really nice and tried to accommodate everyone quickly.We probably over ordered as everything on the menu looked good.  I feel like I should preface this by saying i'm not vegan or vegetarian.  My niece, who is 15, is debating whether she wants to become a vegetarian, so we like to occasionally take her to new places that she can try out.  B52 was a huge win on that front for all three of us.   This place was delicious.  I'd give it more than 5 stars if possible.My boyfriend ordered the falafel sandwich. I have to echo other reviewers here, it was one of the best falafel sandwiches that I've tried.  It's crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside, with great flavor.  I ordered the avocado toast, which was delicious.  My niece ordered the Za'atar flat bread.  I tried and it really liked it.  I think she ordered it not quite understanding that it's not going to have  red sauce.  She thought it was a little dry.  We also ordered the mezze taste 3.  We got the Hummus, Fried tomatoes, and Baba Ghanouj.  I can not recommend getting the baba ghanouj enough. It was the best thing that I ate that day.  The smoked eggplant was phenomenal.  The fried tomatoes were a close second.  the hummus was also delicious.  I would have scraped the bowls clean if I wasn't sharing with two other people.My niece and I had the house made sodas which were also a real treat,  They were really good.This is a great spot.   It's definitely a must stop if you're in the Lawerenceville area."
"2.0","Decided to check this place out since it's in my neighborhood and has been getting great reviews.  We went on a Wednesday night, and it wasn't busy but service was slooooooow.  We walked in and stood at the door for about ten minutes, because although there were 3 tables of diners and a few people waiting for food, there were no employees to be found.We were seated and then left alone to peruse the menu.  We ordered within ten minutes--I got the veggie nepali plate, the husband got sesame chicken, and we got veggie momos to share.  And then we waited.  And waited, and waited.  Two couples walked in and walked out while we waited, because the only employees at the restaurant were in the kitchen the whole time (?).The momos came and they were AMAZING.  Flavorful, with a delicious spicy sauce.  The food came, and it was just okay.  Kinda lukewarm.  My plate was very similar to the thali plates I have had at various Indian places, but honestly, I liked them better at the other places.I may go back for momos and to give this place a second chance--but I will DEFINITELY be calling it in, or bringing at least one bottle of wine, because start-to-finish we were there over two hours, and had been planning on a quick meal.  Yikes!"
"5.0","Always good! Fun environment and great spot to enjoy good food around family and friends."
"5.0","Stopped in here for breakfast on a Sunday morning after some other local places were completely packed - I was pleasantly surprised! You walk in and place your order at the counter, then are given a number to put at your table (or someone comes and gives you a table number while you're waiting in line).Probably took ~10-15mins max for our food to come, and it was delicious. Would highly recommend the ricotta blueberry pancake - one came with my meal, but if I go back and get a different menu item I will likely add one on. Bathrooms are downstairs (customers only), and very clean. They have an elevator to an upper deck as well, but we didn't check it out. Would definitely return!"
"5.0","I walked in here during an all day rain-a-thon in Pittsburgh (so rare, right?) on a Saturday. It was pretty busy, but all of the hustle and bustle was contained to the upstairs, which looked like a cool loft area. It wasn't loud either. The first thing I noticed is how high the ceiling was and I loved that. The art on the walls was a delight to look at too.I ordered something vegan with tofu (I'm not vegan by any means, but wanted to try it), and I got it delivered to me on a plate with two small toasted pieces of bread, lettuce, slices or bell pepper, and warmed tofu. There was something else on the bread that I don't remember, but I was really surprised by how delicious and satisfying this was. I am a fan.For my drink I got an iced vanilla latte and I have to say it's the best vanilla latte I've had around town. I ended up having two more throughout my time there...I just inhaled them. Seriously..so good. I came back on Sunday and had an iced mocha, which was just as good. This is my new favorite place for real!"
"5.0","This restaurant is one of the best farm to table places I have ever been too and one to make point to dine at when in Pittsburgh.  Curtis, the chef and owner, has a wonderful sense and ability to pair foods that bring to life flavors you would not think possible.  We will be back every time we visit Pittsburgh."
"5.0","Awesome buffalo chicken pizza and chicken bites. Home made hot sauce is great!  Balboa la bajfibsi ajdhba"
"5.0","Stopped by on the way through PA heading south. It was a couple miles out of the way to the north shore,  but well worth it. Will definitely go back if we get the chance.  The staff was very fast and friendly.  The food was terrific."
"3.0","Love the look and feel of this rooftop bar, hate the service. Have been here a few times and they definitely need to hire more people. We were here on a Friday night so it was busy. Our waitress came over relatively quickly to give us a round of drinks then she was never to be seen again. 1.5 hrs later I left. I had to get home so my friend stayed to close out my tab. She said she waited another 30 min and she never came back! She then went to the hostess who said the waitress has to close the tab. Ummm where is she? The hostess located her to close the tabs but really? You disappeared for 2 hours? Really wish they had better service here."
"2.0","The menu looked amazing, and based on the rave reviews, I was expecting more....a lot more.The decor is very hip and pleasing to the eye. But the seating was not very comfortable and I was cold throughout my entire meal. Yes, I kept my down jacket on the whole time, and at one point I even considered putting my scarf on.We ordered:-Chicken Wings: Great flavors, very unique, but overly salty. I kept thinking the entire time that it would be perfect if I had a big bowl of white rice to eat it with. (Yes, I love rice and I think it goes with pretty much everything. But more importantly, it would have balanced out the saltiness of the chicken.) 2 drumsticks and 3 wings for $11.-Roasted Carrot Salad: Again, very unique. The carrots were cold but there were a few small cubes of warm chickpea fritter. I liked it a lot. $9.-Tagliatelle: Loved the 1 hour egg. The pasta was a good texture; thick cut and al dente. But it was so overly salty that my dining partner and I had a hard time eating it. All we could taste was salt, salt and more salt. I think it would have been good if we could actually taste a flavor besides salty. $20.And to be clear, I am not overly sensitive to salt. It was just over the top here.The service was good.Not sure I will be back."
"1.0","Closed 40 minutes early. Worker said they were slow. Wonder why if people think you close early. Cause your own problems. Fail."
"5.0","The food is very good. Everything tastes freshly made to order. Exactly the kind of food that Penn Ave desperately needed in Bloomfield. Sometimes the wait is a little long, but only because they're freshly making all of the food, so the wait is worth it."
"1.0","Nah, anyone with the ATM scam better have an awesome hogie and this one is just 'OK' Put card in, get prompted to check balance. 3 bucks unless you know the scam and read the fine print. 2 bucks in their pocket to get money, 3 to the bank.8 dollars to get money from a 'cash only' shop?  I take credit/debit cards and i dont even have a business."
"5.0","I specifically went there for the all you can eat crab legs and i was not disappointed. I don't think I've ever had them better everything about them was perfect. I highly recommend this place on that alone."
"5.0","Thank you Pittsburgh for having such an awesome pizzeria, amazing flavor great size slices and fantastic price , would not eat pizza anyplace else in the burgh"
"2.0","I'm not exactly sure how Americans can distinguish between American restaurants. Like how do you tell the different between greases used?Anyway, despite the name Apollo, it has nothing to do with Greek foodhere. Sure, they serve a Gyro sandwich and salad, but then again, who doesn't these days? I could damn near go to Starbucks for one.So, I had a steak burger with cheese. I guess the new fashionable trend is to call items by fancy names because what they were serving was, well, hamburger. There is in fact a difference between hamburger and steak! It tasted fine, but then again it is really hard to f-up a hamburger (this is one of the reasons why I ordered it too). It came with chips that had the appearance of lay's ruffles. The total price with tax was $5.08, not a bad deal.So, looking at my dining companions meals, about all I saw was friedgrease. A Reuben, and a  chicken melt. The foreigner seemed pretty excited about his greasy sandwich. Maybe it's just me.*this place is cash only*Food Quality/Taste = 2 StarsPortion Size Given Price = 2 StarsPrice = 3 StarsService = N/AExperience with Staff = 2 StarsDecor = 3 Stars"
"4.0","Ordered take out and got lamb korma and goat curry at a 9 out of 10 spice level. Both dishes were distinct and delicious. The korma had a sweet taste to it but still great. The curry had a creamy taste but still great. Different but tasty. The garlic naan could be better, it was thin and and flaky. All in all great Indian food."
"1.0","Worst experience in a Pitt restaurant in 5 years. No wait seating for 6, great. Told dishwasher broke. Waiting on glasses. Took about 15 minutes to get 4 of 6 waters in plastic. order everything then. Drinks and 1 appetizer. 10 minutes later, told our drink order on 2 of 3 need to change. Ok. 15 minutes later receive drinks. 10 later, waiter asks if we are ok.  NO!  50 minutes. No appetizer or food. He says, now this is our waiter, ' I know dishwasher broken, not sure what's up with kitchen!!!!'  Shakes his head of not knowing. Dude, you are our waiter, you are awful!  We ask to find out because we are ready to leave. 5 later he brings out appetizer  he makes himself. Nachos and cold queso. 5 later food comes out. I have a Luke warm pasta dish. Other person with us, his burger totally wrong. We didn't even ask to fix at this point. Then 5 minutes later as we are eating, they bring out nachos and warm queso. Never an apology, owning up to mistakes or horrible waiter, or a discount. First time bringing  out of town family in town. Definitely made mistake choosing this place to impress family. If I could give it zero stars, I would."
"4.0","Not only have I been to Salem's to buy halal meat, but I've also been there to eat AND they catered my wedding! Because they were so extremely helpful in the catering, that's what I'll be reviewing them for (but also go check them out for lunch or dinner and to see their gorgeous mural!)Salem's was wonderful to work with in getting catering for half of our wedding. Due to having a mixed cultural wedding, we had our venue provide half the food (your typical boring wedding food) and Salem's did the Indian half of our food (delicious oh so goodness!).They gave us an absolutely full tasting with all of the aunties and uncles there too. Oh man, their chili chicken is sooo good (the hem of my wedding dress will agree because it got to taste some too when I dropped a whole bunch on it... whoops!). They were great and negotiating specifically what we would need and even gave a staff member to stay with the kitchen down there to direct them on not mixing halal food with non-halal food utensils. Instead of a Pittsburgh cookie table, we had a baklava table - it was a GREAT SUCCESS. Needless to say, all of our friends absolutely loved having this as our catering. Even if you're not Indian or Middle Eastern, you should definitely think about having Salem's cater your wedding or event if you want a very memorable meal!"
"4.0","Lunch decisions are often difficult in the US Steel Tower. If you work or have ever worked there, you understand the difficulty of getting anywhere at lunch time. With people everywhere and long waits for elevators, the lunch hour is basically over by the time you get your food if you choose to eat anywhere in the building. That being said, Craftwork is worth the wait and the lines! Their staff is fast and they do a good job of keeping the line moving and turning orders out in just a few minutes.I have tried a number of items here and everything has been fresh and full of flavor. My current favorite is the buffalo chicken sandwich. Instead of the usual fried slab of chicken drenched in buffalo sauce, their version is filled with chicken that has been shredded and coated in sauce. The sauce itself is spicy and has a little more flavor to it than your typical wing sauce. If you're a buffalo chicken lover, this won't disappoint.They also make amazing fries! The sandwiches are big, but you need these fries so find someone to split an order with or just get them on Friday (because it doesn't count on Fridays, duh). You can get them just about any way you want, as far as sauces go, but I recommend getting a side of the chipotle mayo. It's creamy and spicy and will make even the worst of days right.It can get a little pricey, but that seems to be the case with just about every establishment in USX. I would still much rather support an independent option than one of the equally expensive chains in the building."
"1.0","Came in because I was feeling a fish sandwich and didn't want to go to the strip. I haven't visited the oyster house in a few months but I always enjoyed it when I have. I came in, sat at the bar and waited for about 2-3 minutes before the bartender even took a moment to greet me. She wasn't busy and walked past me a few times. She quickly asked if I wanted a menu followed by 'do you have cash? This is cash only' I told her my bank was across the square at pnc and could order and walk over and get cash out. She said you need to pay before you order. Perhaps this is policy and it's understandable that she would make me aware of that. However she was very rude, and didn't seem to address any points of customer service whatsoever. Even Pbros which is considered fast food in my opinion, does a better job at greeting customers than this lady."
"5.0","10/10 for the friendliness and welcoming-ness of this place. Awesome bald guy who worked the register offered me a cup of water while waiting and we talked about the olympics for several minutes while i waited for my pizza. Pizza itself was delicious - and im from Long Island / hard to please. Was really greasy and that is a drawback for me but a little napkin dabbing did the trick! Wish i could order from them again but they dont deliver to my area!"
"5.0","My my my I cannot find enough words to describe this place maybe because I'm stuffing my face at this moment but let me pause for just a moment. I experienced a flavor explosion - I mean from the first bite I was hooked. Food crack is what this is I'm addicted not only is the food good the environment is authentic but welcoming. You don't have to be any particular race culture or anything to enjoy this food there is something for every one. Prices are fair service is great it's a place I wished I lived closer too there is a grocery store connected and there's even an event hall Salem's deserves 6 stars. Love love love this place."
"5.0","Excellent happy hour specials! Friendly staff! The bartender made a really tasty Moscow Mule. My friend and I each got a meal and 3 drinks and our tab was very reasonable! Definitely recommend!"
"5.0","A bit small so if they are busy you won't be able to get a table. Love the bubble tea and the Korean fried chicken is amazing!"
"3.0","Ehhhhh I expected a lot more from Ki Ramen and I guess would give 3.5 stars if yelp allowed but everything was so average and the service was below average. I can't quite fathom why they have MSG on the table but, makes me wonder how much is in their soup... I had the veggie curry ramen it was decent. The Bao bun was the best part of my meal, I don't feel like I'll need to return."
"2.0","Pittsburgh really needs an izakaya, but a good one. I was disappointed with the execution of the food during my visit. Karage is much better at Chaya than here. It should not need gravy, especially the type of gravy that goes over mashed potatoes.Fried oysters were over done and hard. Not delicate at all like I would expect a panko fried oyster. Pork belly was also overdone.All of the flavors leaned toward being sweet, and were flat.  Definitely a let down, especially considering the price."
"1.0","I really tried with frank's on troyhill. Giving it a second, a third, then a fourth chance. This place is horrible, it honestly taste like it was made with hate. I've never been hung up on before when I  stated it was delivery, or asked 'what' when my call was finally answered. The pizza is practically  inedible. I felt like I was eating the pizza box with dried ketchup as I forced myself to eat a slice. Do yourself a favor, eat your actual cash it might be more satisfying. I will  not be ordering from franks ever again unless some serious changes are made, hopefully new management. Troy Hill really needs a good food spot, Franks is 100% not it."
"4.0","The food here was pretty good. Large portions. My sandwich needed something to make it better just not sure what. I'll have to go back and see what I can add. The place is clean but very small. They only take cash which I thought was ridiculous. They do have an ATM so you can get cash but then you have to pay all the ATM/bank fees. I would definitely try them again."
"5.0","Omg the best burger and our waiter George is the best so knowledgeable and great service thank you !"
"5.0","Just can't ask for anything better than a vegan café with delicious food, amazing coffee & excellent friendly service.When I walked in around 11 am on a weekday I was greeted with a smile and a choice of places to sit. The place was busy but there were still several empty tables. I had a seat at the counter.I started with a café Rico latte...flavors of orange and cinnamon with house made almond milk...delicious! I wanted everything on the menu so it was very difficult to decide...I finally ordered avacado toast and lentil soup. There was a strong lemon theme with preserved lemon on the toast and chunks of fresh lemon in the soup...which I loved...so good! There was lots of avacado on the toast and the bread was the perfect blend of chewy and toasty. The soup was a great lentil soup and so bright with the bits if lemon as I mentioned.It was such a treat to have a meal at B52 and I can't wait to return!"
"4.0","Tired of ordering the same old catering for a business meeting luncheon so I gave Cafe Raymond a try and I am so happy I did. Everyone was very impressed with the Mediterranean Salad that consistedSpring mix, feta cheese, roasted red tomatoes, olives, capers, kalamata olives, cucumbers, red onions and Raymond's house lemon vinaigrette. They did not skimp, so if you are not a fan of any item, ask them to go light especially the onions since red onions are quite strong.  Nice assortment of signature sandwiches. Chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin and red velvet cookies were very fresh and quite the hit. Order was delivered on time and accurately."
"5.0","Over the years, we've stopped in several times. I must admit that I was a bit put off learning their parent company is the same one that owns the Olive Garden and Bahama Breeze, but look: I've been to multiple 'upper echelon' local eateries. The places that have an instant aura of pretentiousness and fresh-faced head chefs who believe they're the best of the best. None of those places seem to deliver for me - expensive, but average food flaunted like culinary masterpieces. This pattern is one of the most prevolent and disturbing in modern dining for me.On the flip side, the Capital Grille has always had consistent, delicious food with attentive, friendly service. Yes, it's a chain and, yes, you're going to pay a bit more than an average night out. The food here is so worth it though! Personally, I don't have an issue splurging if the experience is worthwhile and, for me, it certainly is here. The steaks are fantastic! The sides are fantastic! The service is fantastic! I really have very few negative things to say about The Capital Grille.I guess my only gripe would be the other patrons. They do attract some high profile types; maybe some you'd call yuppies. Generally, people keep to themselves - I had a few people cut in front of me in the coat check line. I guess those big shots had some big things going on - haha! The staff certainly isn't uppity or rude. They are extremely accommodating and attentive.If you're looking for a great meal downtown, give The Capital Grille a try!! You'll pay a little more, but you'll go home happy and fulfilled!"
"5.0","Food was delicious even at closing time.  Prices were reasonable.  With an appetizer, 2 entrées, and tip the meal was $40. The staff was professional and hospitable and I look forward to many visits in the future."
"3.0","The restaurant is really cool, it's a old house converted into a restaurant. The area inside is small but sufficient. We didn't know Sunday lunch time was only buffet, we saw the dosa pics and went in for dosa and had the buffet. Luckily plain dosa is included in the buffet. For 10 dollar there isn't much to complain. The food was good but the options weren't traditional, they didn't have a single paneer dish on the buffet that day. Taste wise I would give the food a 6.5/10. Service for the dosa could have been quicker. The naan was too chewy but a decent place to grab a meal."
"5.0","Really excited to discover this new place in Lawrenceville that seriously rivals BRGR and Burgatory.  Excellent farm-to-restaurant freshly ground burgers, locally sourced everything.  Everyone was friendly, food was delicious!  Definitely will return soon!"
"4.0","Coca Cafe is definitely a go-to for a great brunch in Pittsburgh.  The ingredients are always fresh, dishes imaginative, and staff can always keep their clientele comfortable during their busier times.A few tips before you go:1. You should always expect a wait time of at least 20 minutes.  It's a pretty buzzing place.  Once you arrive, you get to add your name to waitlist. Since it's a BYOB, I typically head up the hill to Arsenal Cider house (about a 6-8 minute walk) to grab something to have with brunch.  If you're lucky they even call you a little sooner.2.  Try to get there early.Because everything is fresh, more popular dishes run out towards the end of their open-hours.Whatever you order, I'm sure you won't be disappointed.  My boyfriend loves the corned beef has dish (which has been sold out a few times that we went).  I think the smoked salmon omelette is pretty good too.  In our most recent visit, I tried out their lunch menu.  I ordered a mushroom soup and a grilled cheese with 4 cheeses, tomato, and caramelized shallots.  The sandwich itself is pretty large since it's on sourdough, but as far as taste I was surprised by how average it was.  The soup however blew me away.  The mushroom soup was cream based, but not too creamy and filled with fresh mushroom pieces.For the price, quality, and portions.  Coca Cafe is a definite win for the Lawrenceville area."
"2.0","It seemed that The Yard had some changes in the kitchen and the menu- and not for the good. They changed the traditional sweet potato fries to waffle fries and they were flimsy and greasy. In fact, the 'battered' French fries were not battered and again were limp and slimy. My caprese grilled cheese didn't have enough filling to cover the entire sandwich and the bread didn't have any toasted color to it, it seemed like just stale white bread. After I complained about it the waitress told me everything looked normal. The tomato soup was too thick and tart. The food on this visit is nothing like I've had during several different times doing here over the past year.  I'm not sure if there was a change in staff, management, or everyone is just getting lazy. Disappointing."
"4.0","The place-I felt like a VIP, sneaking in the back door, leading myself up a staircase, following the sounds of a live DJ on a Thursday evening at 7pm. This little hot spot is full of vibes. Good vibes. Hipster and non hipsters alike unite under the dimly red lit skinny tables. The staff is well oiled and put together, the open kitchen is fun to watch from afar - the expediter being key to shipping out dishes in a timely and orderly manner.The drink-Large drink menu, limited by a night out prior, one of us had a cocktail and the other had a Lone Wolf & Cub (8 oz beer and sake pour). Both were above par delicious and creative.The food-I tend to shy away from most food on a stick, but was convinced by my dining partner to at least share his robatayaki. Boy am I glad I did, the wagyu beef tenderloin was melt in your mouth fantastic. Chicken skin, crisp and salty. And the bacon wrapped quail egg was a burst of breakfast satisfaction in my mouf.Just as we finished those, the octopus balls appeared. Highly raved about online, they were octopus fritters with large pieces of meat in them with a parade of sauces over, under, around and through. They were delicious nuggets and great to share. Next up was the savory pancake - cabbage, brussel sprouts, bacon, yam and dried tuna flake highlighted this number, cooked crispy and covered in more mystery saucy goodness. It is a large 'small plate' be aware. To finish the meal came the pork & shrimp shumai. Served at the perfect temperature, filling with a satisfying mouth feel, these may have been my top choice of the night (sans wagyu stick). They came with a dumpling sauce and each had a single edamame tucked into it's hat.The sweets-Fried ice cream, not your traditional Chi-Chi's set up. But vanilla ice cream encased in mochi then coated and fried. I didn't realize that would be the arrangement and I am not a fan of mochi in general - so I can't fairly judge the dish. But a lot of people were ordering it!What would give it 5 stars? Knock a buck off cocktails, make the smaller plates smaller and cheaper, but otherwise, nicely done! I think I found a new date night hang out! Thanks Umami!"
"4.0","I stopped by here a couple of Friday's ago with my wife for dinner.  We were attending the Nutcracker later in the evening at the Benedum and so I got on a computer to find a place nearby and Yuzu was one of the places that came up.  We both like ramen and other Japanese foods so this was the perfect place.  The inside of the restaurant here is pretty large with a bar on the left side and then seating on the right and behind it.  Our host originally tried to seat us near the bar area but since it was around the holidays the bar was pretty crowded and so we had to ask her to seat us further in the back.  The inside of this place definitely has a Japanese feel to it with the Sakura hanging around, the anime like art on the bathroom doors and the mural of a cherry blossom tree.As others have mentioned the happy hour here is pretty amazing and since we had arrived during it, my wife and I took advantage of it.   So for our appetizers we went with some takoyashi as well as some sat and pepper tofu.  The menu describes the takoyashi as 4 fried octopus croquettes with spicy mayo, nori eel sauce, katsubushi and sesame seeds and describes the salt and pepper tofu as fried tofu with garlic, scallion, jalapeño and garnished with fried red onions.  We enjoyed both of them and while I thought that the takoyashi was going to be my favorite of the two, I was wrong.  It was the golden brown tofu with the perfect amount of seasoning on it which I really enjoyed.  Then for my dinner entree I went with the spicy seafood ramen while my wife went with the karaage curry ramen.  My dish was described as having spicy seafood broth, lemongrass, mushrooms, pei mussels, shrimp, tomato and scallions.   It was an ok dish but for something that was described as spicy, I don't think that mine was particularly spicy.  Since the broth helps to make the dish that was a bit of a letdown although I did enjoy the ramen noodles themselves as well as the shrimp and mussels.  My wife was a much bigger fan of her dish even though we had to look up what karaage (tang fry) was before we ordered.The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Yuzu has some great prices during their happy hour and my wife and I enjoyed almost everything that we tried."
"5.0","I ordered this today for delivery. Absolutely delicious. Took about an hour from order until they got to my door. I live about 15-20 minutes away so I think that's pretty reasonable!!!! Highly recommend you try this food out."
"5.0","There is only one steak, and its name is ribeye!  Can't beat the ribeye cooked in the 1500 degree oven at CG.  What do you need for a good steak?  Quality meat, the right cut (and I go ribeye), minimal seasoning, and technique with a good hot oven!Started with the calamari, Rodney Strong Cabernet, spinach and bacon salad, finished with that great ribeye!Remember, its all about the marbling!"
"5.0","My favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Sushi is fresh (my personal favorite is the ikura nigiri) and anything on the tayaki is delicious. I love the pork belly and bacon-wrapped quail egg from the tayaki menu. My hubby always does the sashimi bowl which he enjoys and is always very fresh. We got to enjoy happy hour this past week with a great drink selection and small bites options. The veggie tempura was fried to perfection, light and crispy, but packed with the perfect amount of flavor. Prices for the happy hour menu were on point. We've walked in on occasion and have had to wait about 20 min or so to sit at the bar in front of grill--I highly recommend getting reservations in advance, especially with a bigger group, since this place gets packed. It will not disappoint. P.S. If you like old fashions, try the Old Osaka. They use Suntori Toki whiskey, and it's amazing!"
"4.0","I'm a big fan of the custom personal pizza concept and this place seems a good version of that. I can't speak for others but the staff was nothing but polite to me. Pizza was tasty and the price was right. Roasted garlic is a potent but excellent addition post cook."
"5.0","Great food! Really loved the brisket hash! That was delish. It was a little different to stand in line, order, then sit down. Definitely worth it. Wife's blueberry ricotta pancakes were very good too."
"5.0","Best patio ever ! I had fig and brie FT . Love it  coffee is strong ! Service was great and owners  are so friendly and they gave me free desert best breakfast place in town. You have to check it out !!! Thank you guys!"
"1.0","I should have known something was wrong when the restaurant was locked and the host had to come and let us in, in the middle of the day.A co-worker and I went there for lunch. We sat down, got our drinks and menus right away. We put in our order fairly quickly, but then proceeded to wait for 40 minutes for our food. I got mine right away, but the server told my co-worker that they didn't have what he ordered.  They didn't tell us in the time that we waited that the grill was down and it was an extremely limited menu. He requested the menu again and proceeded to eat his side salad. After waiting 10 minutes for the menu he decided not to get anything else because he didn't want to wait another 40 minutes and be late. Other tables were also quite upset with service. Another individual ordered steak rare, but came out burnt to a crisp. Another table ordered appetizers shortly after we sat down, and did not receive them until after we got our entrees. Not only that, they ordered the sliders, and were not told that they were unavailable due to the grill being down until after they received their wings as apps. Never once did the servers ever seem to care or try to improve their attitudes. I would have been understanding with the grill being limited as long as we were told ahead of time, or if they actually seemed to care about the us.After waiting another 20 minutes for refills and the check, we finally left and will not be returning."
"3.0","The good things to start with. One of the few places still open after 9pm on a Sunday. The patio is great - as well as the location right in the Market Square. The beer selection is great too. Service was ok nothing special. One of the guest went in with a dog - and a waitress was touching the dog every-time passing by - but I haven't seen her washing or disinfecting her hands. To start with we ordered the Mac&Cheese with black truffles to share. It was ok but it had not really a truffle taste (not even from a truffle oil) and I could not find any black truffles. I had a fish taco - this was ok and quite big. My wife ordered the mushrooms risotto - which was really catastrophic (sorry) - but you couldn't eat the stuff it was sooooooooo salty - I think the whole salt dispenser got into that risotto by accident. We let the server know - with no immediate reaction. But surprisingly he had taken the risotto off the check. So location 3 stars food not more than 2 stars - I'm ending up giving 3 stars because the server took the risotto off the check without saying."
"4.0","While in town I stopped here to eat some dinner and watch a game on one of their many tv's. The game I specifically wanted to watch wasn't showing but the staff was able to quickly accommodate my request.I enjoyed an order of dry dusted wings, some tater tot nacho's and a few Lite beers from Miller. All good and as expected. The service was good, lots of games to watch and overall a good atmosphere."

"4.0","I stopped in here to grab a falafel wrap before a hair appointment, and my goodness, that was easily the best falafel wrap I've had possibly ever.  It was fast, filling, and delicious.  Not too much sauce--just enough to moisten the contents--and even then, without it, the falafels would not have been too dry.  I really hope I get some more time to come back and do a full sit-down and really see a good spread."
"5.0","Salem's in the Strip District serves up authentic Middle Eastern fare, cafeteria style. The cafeteria has long tables to enjoy your food at and you order from the line in the back. They have a pretty large menu of those Middle Eastern staples you'd expect to see, including shawarma, tikka masala, curry, gyros and tandoori, and a bunch of sweets. The market adjacent to the cafeteria has fresh butchered meats which are undoubtably used in the cafeteria, so rest assured that you're getting authentic and fresh meals no matter your choice.Goat Curry- 4.3/5I don't think i've ever had goat so i wanted to give it a shot. Not a huge fan of the meat in general. The flavor of the curry was spot-on, though.Chicken Tikka Masala- 4.5/5This stuff is really good. The sauce is near perfect, but the chicken was a tad overcooked. I typically avoid getting chicken from restaurants because it's never cooked like i like it (obviously cooked to temperature but i always feel like it's dry), but it could just be this particular batch. This is their staple dish and if you're looking for a great meal, I recommend. Spinach paneer- 4.8/5Okay. So you get a side with your meal and if you do not get this spinach, you better get back in line and redo the whole order. You can basically see the butter incorporated throughout, and what isn't good with that much butter, but wow. Just get it and agree with me, you'll see. Our total was only $21 for the goat curry and tikka masala meal, a gyro and fries, and two drinks. And the portions are immense. I can eat and I will be having this for lunch tomorrow as well. Go to Salem's and enjoy something different, or go outside of your comfort zone and try this amazing cultural cuisine. I'll be back!"

"4.0","A small restaurant tucked away in the residential streets of college town by the university, this place provided a quick and delicious Indian meal to satiate my curry cravings. I ordered for takeout over the phone, no hassles, and picked up my food, no hassles.Vegetarian samosas: delicately fried with a fairly flaky exterior and absolutely delicious interior! I really enjoyed the balance of potato, peas, etc. that was fluffy on the palate. I feel that the exterior could have been crispier, but honestly was a solid samosa.Chicken tikka masala: a bit sweeter than what I'm familiar with. I appreciated the strong tomato flavor as well as a kind of smokey caramelized sugar possibly as a result of a sweeter base. One other thing I really enjoyed was that the chicken was very tender and very tasty! The one criticism is that the dish was overall a bit saltier than I preferred.Overall a very good Indian meal!"
"5.0","I'm going to start with the bottom line for this place: Awesome. Affordable, delicious, and saucy entrees provide both filling and tasty meals. The beef and broccoli has a liquidy, mouth-watering sauce that is soaked into the broccoli and meat, providing an amazing experience for one's taste buds. Whats even more awesome, are the daily lunch specials. These give you a regular entree, along with your choice of rice and your choice of soup or egg roll, for only $8.50 or so. ALL of the food is cooked well and never failed to please me. With the extremely affordable price that can sometimes be cheaper than fast food, and the absolutely wonderful food selections, Chinatown Inn makes a spectacular meal that can't be missed."
"5.0","Incredible food. Completely elevated bar food. My favorite food in Pittsburgh for the specified price point."
"4.0","Cheap beer and great ramen, what a combination. One of the beers they had was a cream ale that was $2, and I asked the waitress if it was actually alcoholic cause I couldn't believe that they would sell real beer for so cheap. (It was, and it was delicious.) The ramen can come with different add-ons. The butter bomb didn't really add much to it unfortunately, it seemed like just a gimmick, but I do like to get the chili paste on the side. I definitely recommend adding an egg!"
"5.0","I've visited the Yard multiple times, but most recently for a girl's afternoon out for brunch. Came in on a Sunday morning on a barely needed reservation on OpenTable and were seated immediately at some high top tables. Our waiter was great (wish I remembered his name). He kept the drinks flowing but let us have the space to chat. As for the food, I went for the chicken and waffles sliders. They were to die for! The chicken was well seasoned and just greasy enough to satisfy. The gravy was well balanced and the home fries were perfectly crisp! I'd definitely recommend this spot to anyone."
"5.0","I cannot believe how much food I got for $9! At least 2 meals worth! So good too...chicken tikka masala and spinach paneer. I can't wait to go back and try more!"
"5.0","Great neighborhood spot with delicious cocktails and bites. They have a lot of board games that you can play with friends and a great vibe with the music and staff. Short walk to the overlooks on Mt Washington so it makes for a great date or a stop with friends while showing off the city! I got the Leona cocktail and will be back again!"
"5.0","overall extremely good quality tacos never disappointed and always great music on every time I come in! Cool hip joint and cheap!"
"2.0","Price to portions is not equal.Sure this place has good food, but so do tons of restaurants in Pittsburgh. Don't believe the hype and go somewhere else where you can get your dollars worth and not feel looked down upon by the elitist setting."
"3.0","I was excited to see this place open up.  Having lived in San Francisco before, I was a big fan of pupusas and felt dismayed that they are not easy to find in Pittsburgh.  I visited Colonia specifically to try the pupusas.While I was excited to finally find somewhere that served them, they didn't quite measure up to my expectations.  The outside tortilla was thicker than I preferred, and though the fillings were tasty, the pork pupusa suffered from a lack of cheese that the potato pupusa contained.  The prices were also higher, with a single pupusa going for $4 or $5.  When I go back to Smallman Galley I will more likely try a different restaurant than coming back to Colonia.  But if a day comes that I feel the need to specifically get pupusas, at least I know this is here for now."
"4.0","We had to stop when we saw their Bloody Mary topped with soft shell crab, shrimp, and bacon! It's nice because you can build it however you want so you don't have to get certain toppings if you don't want them. Their standard Bloody Mary is $11 and then +$2 for shrimp and +$11 for soft shell crab. Then you can add different spice levels for +$1. I chose the medium spice level which was a perfect spicy taste but didn't give me a burning cough. These bloody Mary's are awesome and the add one are well worth it!"
"4.0","Not the run of the mill HGI bar. Decent beer selection, and friendly staff. Lots of options outside the hotel, but this place is handy when your to tired to venture out. Bartenders are attentive, accommodating, as well as capable. Pleasent surprise!"
"5.0","Fantastic neighborhood market! Excellent variety of items from beautiful fresh produce to locally baked breads & ice cream to salty snack foods.  Incredibly friendly staff as well.  A true asset to Upper Lawrenceville."
"5.0","We stopped here for dinner after a full day in the Strip and were told it'd be 45 minutes for a table for two. Fortunately it only was about 5 minutes!! Our server was very friendly and attentive. We ordered the catfish bites and lobster bisque. The catfish bites were disappointly not crispy on the outside, though they were still good. They would have been better crispy instead of rather floppy and soggy. The lobster bisque was yummy, but for a giant bowl we only got one little 'crustini' I believe it was called. Two or three would have been better for the size of the bowl. My husband and I shared the two dishes, and it was plenty for us. The portions were great, and the prices weren't bad at all. I recommend it for sure.An added perk was Robert Wholey (the owner's father) stopped by our table and talked to us for a minute. Later he offered us some oyster.  It was a great addition to our evening to get to say hello to him and meet the face behind Wholey's in the Strip!!! He was very kind!We'll be going again!!"
"4.0","Stopped by after a couple hours at the Heinz museum. Very good sandwiches! Would stop in again when visiting Pittsburgh!"
"4.0","I absolutely love Panera!  I like the pick 2 that they have on the menu. I usually get a salad with soup.  I would recommend trying out the steak and blue cheese salad.  I'm not a fan of blue cheese, so I ask them for feta cheese instead.  The cream of chicken and wild rice is really good too!  I have yet to try the broth bowls, but if you go on their website and watch about 2 videos that are 2 minutes in length then you get $5.00 off of the broth bowl!  Hopefully, it's still on the website!  Check it out! :)"
"4.0","Peppis .. well known sandwich shop in the burg.   I just started a new job in the North Side so couldn't wait to go back to Peppis.  I remember visiting the strip district location often many years ago. I stopped in and ordered a steak hoagie.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  Cash only - no credit cards.  There is an ATM in the restaurant just in case you don have any cash handy.   I was surprised at the very little meat on my hoagie especially by the price $6.75.  I might just order double meat next time.   Another surprise was that there is a burger called '#7 Roethlis Burger' which I love the idea although I have never had .. but ketchup brand offered is not 'Heinz' brand.   I love the menu .. so many different types of sandwiches, salads etc. there is something for everyone.   These were just observances.. my steak hoagie was good and satisfied with the great customer service.  I just visited recently during lunch time at Noon.  As soon as I got there I regretted it but soon realized 'it was all good'.  The staff was so cool and calm and on the ball.. it was a zoo and the line was out the door."
"5.0","One of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. I frequently have Silver Palace deliver food to me and I have dined in before. I love the food (especially the curry chicken) and the staff is genuinely friendly."
"3.0","A lot of people complain about the food, but I don't think it's that terrible.The food could be spicier, but I'm a spice freak when it comes to Indian food. I expect my tongue on fire after leaving. The selection isn't that wide either, but for Indian buffet's it was okay. The price wasn't worth the quality of the food. :/**I've only ever been to the buffet so I have no comment on the quality of the food on the menu."
"1.0","Disgusting! Would give a zero if I could. Found a grasshopper in our meal, staff was unapologetic. Check health department records!"
"4.0","Note: I've only been a patron for lunch; I'll update my review after I visit for dinner.We ended up heading over to Sausalido for lunch since it's always been on my list of restaurants to try and I was in the mood to enjoy a full meal instead of the quick drop-in for takeout or a sandwich.Upon arriving, we noticed we were the only patrons of the restaurant at the time (around 12:45 PM).  Yes it was a bit unexpected, but it meant we got the full attention of the waitress and we could be seated anywhere we liked.  While we looked over the menu, she brought out a bread plate with a white bean dip drizzled with olive oil, balsamic vinegar and topped with red peppers.  The dip was delicious and we had no problem finishing everything.  Later she brought out three freshly made bowls of seafood chowder, compliments of the chef.  She noted with a laugh, 'one the perks of being the only customers right now.'  The seafood chowder was chock-full of fish, scallops, mussels, and shrimp.  The base of the soup itself was flavorful and light, not like traditional chowders bogged down with heavy cream.  My two companions decided to start out with two more cups of the seafood chowder while I opted for their Capon and Ditalini soup, a chicken noodle soup offered every day.  My soup is freshly prepared with their house chicken stock with wilted spinach and topped with cheese.  I preferred the seafood chowder, but I have to note that the chicken stock had multiple layers and many subtle flavors.For our entrees I ordered their gnocci, and my companions ordered their crab cakes and their flank steak.  My gnocci is advertised as 'house made', but realistically it was brought in from elsewhere.  It was served with braised lamb in a tomato ragout and topped fish fresh basil and freshly grated cheese.  The flavors were all there, but I like my gnocci with a bit more of a bite to it.  The braised lamb was a bit tough and ended up detracting from the dish as opposed to improving it.  The crab cakes were pretty good, but would've been slightly more epic if the lump meat was a bit larger.  It's a pretty small portion, so do make sure you order a soup to go along with it.  The flank steak was served medium rare topped with a horseradish creme fraiche with smashed potatoes.  The steak was excellent; cooked well and flavorful from being marinated and seasoned properly.  The smashed potatoes were a bit too cheesy for my liking, but I like how smashed potatoes have lots of textures going on with mild lumps of potato and potato skin in the mix.Sausalido is BYOB, so you can bring your own bottle and you definitely should ($2 corkage fee per person).  Lots of entrees from the lunch menu have encore presentations on the dinner menu; however, there are new dishes as well such as a duck breast, scallops, and a pork chop.There aren't too many seats in the restaurant, so for dinner I'd recommend calling ahead for reservations just to be on the safe side."
"5.0","Second time here. Came in for the #7 'Roethlisburger' and it didn't disappoint. My kids loved the environment and reading the stuff in the walls. My son recommended a sandwich and they said they might make it and name it after him. While we don't expect it, what a cool thing to do. We will definitely be back!!"
"5.0","Outstanding Tacos!After hearing my wife rave about their tacos and nachos for months I had to see what all the hype was about for myself. The inside is fairly small which is a shame as in order to really enjoy their tacos you need to eat them freshly made. Maybe ten seats wrapped around the cooking area and maybe another three or four seats at the window. Lucky for us, the evening we went the place was almost completely empty at the time we arrived but filled up quickly after.As far as their taco choices go they offer about six different tacos. Carnitas (pork), Pollo (chicken), two types of ground beef tacos (Carne Molida and Americano), a Vegan taco and a Special Daily Taco Special each for $3 each served on either a flour or corn tortilla. On my first visit I went with a Carnitas, Pollo and Carne Molida taco. The Carnitas taco features slow smoked pork, Mexican Slaw, Pico de Gallo, Mexican Farmers Cheese and Cilantro & Lime. The Pollo taco features marinated chopped chicken, Avocado, Cholula Crema, Pico de Gallo, Mexican Farmers Cheese and Cilantro & Lime. The Carne Molida taco features Spicy Ground Beef, Bell Peppers, Jalapenos, Cholula Crema, Mexican Farmers Cheese and Cilantro & Lime. Of the three the Carnitas was my favorite by far! The perfectly cooked pulled pork was so flavorful. It was melt in your mouth tender. The Pollo taco was a close second as the marinated chicken was very flavorful as well. The Carne Molida taco was good but not as much of a stand out as the other two.On my second visit I had the Carnitas Nachos which for $5 is a stellar bargain as I was completely stuffed after I finished them. Some of the best nachos I have had in a long, long time. I usually don't frequent The South Side or Carson Street very often, but Doce Taqueria will be changing that for sure!"
"5.0","We treated ourselves to lunch today, in grand flavors, at the Capital Grille in downtown Pittsburgh.  I ordered and enjoyed the lobster roll ($22.00), rich juicy chunks lightly seasoned and my lunch date enjoyed the Blue Burger ($18.00) rare and seasoned fries.  Both were so tasty, the service was wonderful."
"4.0","First time here and it did not disappoint! It's a larger establishment than I thought and to my surprise wasn't crowded on this rainy Saturday evening. The service was great; very fast, friendly and attentive which always makes for an enjoyable experience.  Our server had another sever in training and she did a great job! We started with the fried goat cheese bites. They were so good and melted in your mouth! I had a beer (White Lightning) and my BF had a Dark and Stormy. Their beers they brew were all $1 off, which was cool. I had a 'Liberty' burger which was a cheeseburger with a special sauce and a side salad. Delicious! You can tell this is organic beef and I love farm to table and locally sourced restaurants! We also shared hand-cut french fries with rosemary, which was a nice flavoring. Well done, Burgh'ers!"
"4.0","I love this place. They have few seats outside and on the first floor, but there is more seating upstairs. They have some really nice photos of (bagels, of course) that get you in the mood. They even have a cute window with a nice view up there. The whole place is really cute!"
"5.0","4.5/5. Best pancakes I've ever had. Service was great and the wait was nonexistent when we went. Wasn't a huge fan of the turkey sausage, but my dining partner said the normal sausage was fantastic. I had the banana chocolate and it was amazing! Will always be a Pittsburgh favorite."
"4.0","Thanks to Tamarind, I think I've found my new favorite Indian dish: Saag. It's like an indian version of creamed spinach.YUM!"
"5.0","There's 'always something' going on at Siempre Algo which is the meaning of the name of this New American restaurant and bar on East Ohio St that opened up last week.Occupying the space formerly known as the Garden Cafe, Chef Brian H converted the building into a 2 story restaurant along with a bar. Having made a reservation, I learned that they open the bar at 5 but serve dinner at 6. When I arrived at 5, I was unaware of this practice but they were willing to oblige me anyway and let me order from the menu.I had a very friendly and informative waitress who told me that the plants that decorated the tables came from her own home. All food is farm sourced and they support small businesses. I was given a complimentary prosecco wine which I observed they give to anyone who comes in here.As we went over the menu she explained that the first part of the menu which they call 'snacks' are meant for sharing. However, they would be happy to box up whatever I couldn't eat. I inquired about gluten free and vegetarian/vegan options. I learned that a few items on the menu are gluten free and one entree and one snack is entirely vegan.I was debating over getting the carrot salad or the Bavarian pretzels as my snack but after learning how big the salad was I settled for the pretzels. They are made from scratch using sourdough covered in sea salt, and served piping hot. They also come with whole grain mustard. Believe me the one was so good I had to really control myself from eating the other one because I had ordered an entree. I decided to have as my main course the Eicher's Farm chicken which is a roasted chicken breast with winglet. The entree is served with chicken liver bread pudding, English peas and mushrooms. I did have to wait a while to get it but when I did I could tell the chicken was moist and tender. Please note that you will find a chicken bone near or on the winglet so be careful with that part but it was sliced so nicely it was easy for me to cut. I thought the pudding was very good and as my waitress told me this was a filling meal. The only downside I must mention is that they do not serve bread here. It took a bit of maneuvering to finish the peas and mushrooms with my knife and fork-yes she took away my spoon before I was served the entree so I was without that as well.Even though I was fairly fully I had to see the dessert menu. There are three items on it so I decided for the chocolate mousse with tart cherries and a sprig leaf. Although it was small it was very rich and very dense! Was a good ending to a great meal!The downstairs dining area is small but features an open kitchen. The bar also isn't that big but by the time I was finished the bar was fairly crowded. Therefore, I would strongly suggest making reservations since the place is small and serves quality food. Expect to pay over $20.00 for an entree. Snacks are usually under $10.00.  Couple your meal with a cocktail or wine and you are set for a delicious dinner. They do have WiFi-passcode available upon request. They did take my suggestion to add bread to the menu so it would be easier to enjoy the sides. I did get to take my other pretzel home along with some extra mustard to share with the family and believe me they loved it!  Located on East Ohio St near Arnold's tea, metered street parking is available."
"5.0","Their bbq is absolutely fantastic. The right amount of smoke flavor, falling off the bone meat, no gristle or fat. The fries were tasty and crispy. This was my wife and my first time trying here. We ordered through UberEATS. Uber screwed our order up the first time by not sending it through. After calling the restaurant, they were extremely helpful and got right on our order. The cons, for me, come down to my preference. I personally like a thicker red beans and rice, and a little more bbq sauce on my ribs. But that's me. Everything else was perfect. I hope one day they have brisket. It's been a very long time since I had a good BBQ brisket, and I feel like they would knock it out of the park. We will be ordering from them again. Amazing!"
"5.0","Love this bar! knowledgeable bar staff, great cocktails. I had the make-believe tea it was amazing. Definitely check this place out if your in Bloomfield. I only wish the kitchen was open later so I could try the food."
"4.0","Completely chill environment. I pretty much always get the chicken quesadilla which is awesome, so I really can't comment on anything else. The prices are good and the service is quick."
"5.0","Great great Indian/ Middle Eastern food. Excellent meat quality. Good, quick service! And big portions!"
"5.0","Great variety of sandwiches and all day breakfast. I had the buffalo chicken wrap and my wife had the Verona (turkey breast, smoked applewood bacon, cheddar, lettuce and tomato on ciabatta) The wrap I had was delicious and my wife enjoyed her sandwich but they forgot the cheese on the Verona. Fret not, customer service was amazing and when I mentioned the missing cheese after a hostess asked how everything was they offered a free pastry! Chose red velvet and wow moist not stale and sitting out for days- very satisfying. Visiting from DC but when we move to Pittsburgh will definitely come back for the all day breakfast cause it looked just as amazing!"
"5.0","This was the bright spot during my day of jury duty. I had arepas in NYC a few years ago, but I bet most Pittsburghers have no idea what they are. This is a great lunch for about $10. I had the Best Friends lunch special with a can of pop, which was $10.88 or $0.18 more than I earned for sitting on my rear all day for jury duty. The shredded beef empanada was warm- spicy, not too hot for my midwestern palate. They have a small seating area and it was perfect for watching the traffic go by, except for one aspect: I smelled a bit like the fryer for the rest of the afternoon, so if you are headed back to the office you may want to get takeout. Don't forget the sauces, I had to choose only one, but they have a lot of options. You may ask: What do they go on? I have no idea - they went with both my arepa and empanada and no one judged me."
"5.0","Finally, I find a place with croissant breakfast sandwiches! For breakfast today, I drove a half hour to get a heart beat juice with: beet, orange, ginger, parsley and carrot. The juice was well balanced, cold pressed, unpasteurized and raw-although I didn't see an organic label. The breakfast sandwiches are create your own- I chose croissant, egg, sausage, roasted red pepper, onion, cheddar and spinach. The croissant was buttery, warm and flakey. I was very impressed with the quality, service and atmosphere. I'll be back!"
"5.0","Their bubble tea is awesome! Its worth a drive from bridgeville. The Bubble the was just right not too sweet."
"5.0","I've had my share of steak and cheese... Peppi's just made the top of my list... fries are pretty damn good too!!"
"2.0","I like the atmosphere, and in a hip portion right on Butler, interior seating in three sections of different elevation.But everything about the food was lackluster. Cauliflower appetizer had a slight peanut flavor but was mostly bland, and our two ramen bowls were not up to par. Dragon ramen had an undercooked egg compared to what is expected in Ramen, and mine was far too salty.  We will be back to try more of the options and give Ki Ramen another chance, but the first time through was a disappointment."
"4.0","The food tastes great. The portions are more than ample. The staff is friendly. What a nice surprise for basically an impulse visit. Our friends at the Pittsburgh Winery made the recommendation. We are glad we listened."
"2.0","The food is good here, but and its a big But, Service can be terrible.  It's not that the servers are rude, they're not.  But when it takes over an hour to get your breakfast, that is a bit much.  And the tables by the front door on a cold day can be miserable.  And no food, however good is worth an hour of miserable."
"5.0","This place makes Vegan food so much fun! Many vegan restaurants I have tried, the food is a selection of mashed baby foods. Onion Maiden puts a spin on some of your favorite American comfort foods, Asian favorites and even charcuterie. The best by far are the pastries of which I always want to take half a dozen home for later. Their ability to mimic cheeses are better than anything in the grocery stores. I'm not a true vegan but do have a fairy allergy, so getting to have anything on the menu without fear is fabulous. I am having cake and eating it too! Gets super busy because the hours are minimal but worth the effort. The atmosphere is funky and the staff is so down to earth. Highly recommend."
"1.0","Not the worst Mexican food I've ever had.  But the second worst.  (The worst was El Toro Taco in Homestead, FL.  I actually joined Yelp so I could write a review of that mess.) At both places I would have been better opening a can of Old El Paso and eating it cold.I am STILL angry I spent $27 on absolute cr*p at this dirty place.  And that's the first time I've sw*rn in a Yelp review!P.S. I only ended up here because I was visiting Pittsburgh.  Ended up downtown, starving, and couldn't get a signal on my iPhone to consult my Yelp app. to help select a place.  I will never go cold turkey again!P.P.S.  The server was actually very nice.  But how could she have lied to me and told me the food in the restaurant was good?  How could she have even called it food?P.P.P.S.   I knew from the first bite it would be a mistake. The chips tasted like they were cooked in old oil.  The guacamole was crusted in brown (sent it back).  And the salsa?  Just tasted like good old sodium."
"4.0","First time eating at a Thai place--success! I had the thai fried rice and my fiance had the pad thai. Both were hot and delicious. We had plenty of leftovers to have a couple more meals out of it too! It's small, but they have places to sit and our server was very attentive."
"1.0","So I ordered the Ranchero Burrito, and as per the description it says it has sour cream and guacamole, i kid you not! Those two are nowhere to be found in my Burrito, all i see is Rice, beans and the chicken if its not with the sauce the Burrito is completely dry like a concrete. I dissected my Burrito to see where is it, and its so expensive for such a plain dry food. So disappointed!"
"5.0","I've eaten here all through undergrad and grad school.  I am in love with their deep dish pizzas; they're on the pricier side but are simply delicious and are large enough that the small will be enough to last me for 3 meals.  I also used to buy a large regular pizza and would have enough to reheat (this pizza reheats remarkably well in a toaster oven) for days afterward; Little Nippers has seen me through more finals than I want to remember!I've also had the steak salads here that are served in the 'Pittsburgh' style (i.e. loaded with fries and cheese on top) and am a fan.  It is a bit pricier than the other pizza shops in the area that cater to the students but it is definitely worth it."
"5.0","I haven't lived in the Northside of Pittsburgh for 19 years, so when I'm downtown and hungry...Peppi's always comes to mind and never a bad decision! From the guys that work behind the counter, the atmosphere, and the best cheesesteak around-I love it. If you haven't treated yourself to a good 'cheat day' for a while, I recommend!"
"1.0","Traveled to this establishment through busy downtown event traffic seeking oysters. Sat at the bar. I ordered a Corona with lime and it was given to me promptly and it tasted fresh and cold. Soon after that I was informed they were completely out of oysters. An oyster bar having supply issues like this is completely inexcusable, especially one that operates in a high profile location like Market Square. Also, the bartender seemed very unhappy, and was having difficulty fulfilling his duties. He was having verbal conflicts with the waitress who was attempting to order drinks from him. When another guest had an issue with a dish that had been served to them, the staff yelled up the stairs to what I assumed to be the kitchen for someone to come down and resolve the matter. Very unprofessional atmosphere. The tension among the staff was palpable, it just didn't seem like any of them really wanted to be there, which made me not want to be there. The supply issues and the way the employees were operating leads me to believe this place is poorly managed. I paid for my drink and left, not wanting to risk putting in a food order to the overwhelmed staff for a dish I didn't come for anyway."
"5.0","A great place for a romantic dinner... Street parking close by... It was a little difficult to find, but I'm so glad we did... I wasn't aware that it was downstairs... We were seated right away... Got menus and drinks quickly... The menu was short & precise & included a daily special... Our meals were all fabulous... The bean & sausage soup was so flavorful... I ordered the penne pasta with sausage & I've never had a better Italian meal... My family ordered the Lobster Ravioli, Gnocchi, and and the Chicken pasta & they all said how fab"
"3.0","Went with a friend for lunch before a holiday performance. We arrived a few minutes late for our reservation, but they had our table prepared and ready. After waiting a few more minutes than I thought we should have, our waiter acknowledged us and, from there the service was fine - attentive without being intrusive.My friend ordered the salmon beet salad and thoroughly enjoyed it. The salmon was cooked to the desired temperature She was pleased with how the citrus worked with the other elements of the salad. I had the crab cake sandwich. While the flavors were good, the middle of the sandwich was refrigerator cold. Hopefully, this was an isolated incident and not a matter of overall inconsistency. I would go back again to give the restaurant another chance."
"2.0","I had a table for four last evening. We were thanking someone for help that they provided us all year long. I made a reservation about three weeks in advance. I typically thoroughly enjoy dining here. On this evening, not at all. We were seating in the lounge right next to the doorway. The foyer area was packed which allowed the bar and lounge to back up with unsafe crowding. The table was not a normal sized table for four. The waitress had to yell when speaking to us. There was little opportunity to have conversation with the noise level. I had countless ass in my face from people standing near the table. Constantly be bumped as well. At 6:30 pm they were out of shellfish platters and augratin potatoes. How can that happen? I can't afford to come here but once or twice a year. After spending about $440 with tip all I got was 'it's really crazy tonight. Come back another time, I'm sure it will better.' Guess what it will probably be a long time. Again the food was good. But I come here for the full experience - no excuse was going to be acceptable. There are other overpriced steakhouses. Very disappointed!"
"4.0","I eat at Kassab's quite frequently.  They have wonderful Sleek.  The prices are very reasonable, the food is freshly prepared, and everything is quite delicious.  The wait staff have always been very attentive and friendly."
"3.0","One of the popular steakhouses downtown. If you're looking to have a special night out and splurging a little, this is the spot. Service quality is great but expect long wait times during the popular lunch and dinner hours.Although I've heard great things, as a vegetarian diner, I was not overly impressed. They offer two off-menu vegetarian dishes: pasta with tofu/veggies or a rice dish with tofu/veggies. You get to select the vegetables and how your tofu is prepared. It was disappointingly bland and dry. The rice must've been sitting out for a while because it was crunchy by the time I got it. I had to ask for a sauce to drench over the tofu to add some flavor. It was like biting into styrofoam. The truffle fries saved the meal because they were delicious. Although they didn't have a house aioli, our server whipped up one last minute and it needed up tasting fantastic. We ended with ice cream for dessert that our server loaded up with berries, chocolate syrup and whipped cream - plus it was on the house for their Valentines' Day special. Everything tastes better if it's free."
"1.0","Nice location. Good service. Except the bathroom cleaner poured out my ENTIRE drink while i set it down to take a bathroom break, when i came back to the sink he ran away when i asked him why he poured it out!! I went to the second floor bar to find compensation, and the asian bartender told me he did not believe me. Poor service no trust. No way to treat a respectable customer who bought 4 drinks"
"3.0","Sadly, the fish tacos that my colleague and I ordered for dinner were arguably the worst I've ever had to date. You could ask me why I ordered fish tacos in Pittsburgh but that's a conversation for another time. Point is, if it's on the menu it had better be good!So, the majority of the tacos were left on the plate.I did not hold back and let it be known to the waitress that I was disappointed with my entree. She asked me if I wanted to talk to the manager, and I declined.The reason why they get 3 stars is because the restaurant decided to not charge us for the tacos, which was the right thing to do.Moral of the story, if it's less than 4.5 stars in Yelp, Buyer Beware!"
"3.0","Eat'n Park is way different from when I was growing up. The food is OKAY. The staff was just there, nothing special, no smiles. The service was slow. This just wasn't a great experience and it's sad because I was looking forward to it as there are no eat'n parks around my residence. I could go the rest of my life without going back although the cookies are still delicious and soft."
"4.0","Really enjoy this place for a quick breakfast or lunch.  It is nice to have a somewhat healthy option when you are in a hurry.  I say somewhat because even though they use fresh ingredients, many of their meals are not the best calorie and fat-wise.  Either way though they are delicious.  On top of that the workers are all super friendly and helpful, even when you are asking annoying questions at 7am.My favorite breakfast item they have is the spinach, mushroom, and goat cheese egg pocket.  This is actually a pretty healthy item, but you would not know it by the taste.  All the flavors come together perfectly and it makes for a great and filling breakfast.  For lunch my favorite is the buffalo wrap.  It comes with greek yogurt ranch which is very good."

"5.0","We are definitely going to be return visitors to Station!Station's space is great--the restaurant divides neatly into a bar area with a few high tables and a quieter dining space. Since we dined during Little Italy days, the bar side was a bit crazee, but the dining area was pretty quiet. The place was tastefully decorated, although we heard that it is still unfinished. One thing we noted is that the hanging light fixtures over the tables were at just the right height to be right in the waiter's face when delivering or removing items from the table. Awkward. Our waiter sheepishly admitted that he'd been clunked in the head more times than he cared to admit.The cocktail and wine lists were small but carefully curated. The wines we tried were really nice and between $8-$13 a glass. Our waiter was very informed about the drinks and ingredients and attentive to the needs of the table. We took all of his recommendations for dishes and were not disappointed. The menu was really attractive--again, small and well thought-out. Many of the dishes looked delicious but our party decided on the Chicken Liver Mousse and Heirloom Tomato Salad to start. The mousse was incredibly---great smooth texture, wonderful crunch added by the breadcrumbs, acidity from the red onion. Our slices of bread were a little on the burnt side, but still very good. The tomato salad was also very good--some sweetness added from the corn, acidity from the dressing, skins removed from the small tomatoes to remove any bitterness. Our entrees were all aggressively seasoned--so beware that dishes you identify as likely to be salty are going to be REALLY salty, like the Tagliatelle with Smoked Pork Shank. However, all dishes were tasty. The pasta was cooked perfectly and even though it was definitely a heavier dish, there were no ill effects after eating it.  My least favorite of the entrees was probably the Charred Eggplant and Yogurt Ravioli. While the ravioli itself was awesome (never thought of adding yogurt as a filling and the slight tang was great!), the bowl itself was a semi-unattractive mess of oil and breadcrumbs. The winner at the table was definitely the Crispy Skin Chicken Breast & Leg that came with an incredible your-mom's-Thanksgiving-like bread pudding and this delicious buttermilk vinaigrette. We'll definitely be back to Station and hope that as it settles into its new spot, it keeps the clarity and focus on ingredients. Even though the head chef was not in during our dinner service, the food was great, so there's definitely quality control and talent in the kitchen."
"1.0","Terrible. On a mixed veggie dish I asked for tofu to be steamed instead of fried and they sent me a giant container of just steamed tofu. When I called the woman refused to give a refund and said I could pick up the veggie portion of the dish the next day. Lol. GrubHub refunded my money (ps the rest of what they did deliver was obviously defrosted- never again)."
"4.0","Visited a few weeks ago with my husband. Everything I tried was great. The meats were all wonderful (as I'd expected). My favorite dish was the octopus. My only complaint is that there was no bread. I'm used to tapas restaurants having tomato bread and there wasn't any bread in sight on the menu."
"5.0","Consistently the best food truck at festivals. Friendly staff, delicious food, and bulgogi bowl is truly my go to food truck meal."
"4.0","What a great dinner!! A group of 7 of us went there to celebrate my birthday, so of course,  I was predisposed to have a great time - but the food delivered!We had appetizers of Salted Cod fritters, the Mozzarella appetizer.  Everyone had various entrées - which everyone loved!I had the PEI Mussels with Fettuccini and saffron cream.  The rich sauce was delicious and complemented the mussels perfectly.  I'm so angry because in the post-dinner-celebration my leftovers got lost.  Or stolen, now that I think about it, most likely stolen.Others at the table had the Duck breast as well as the Gnocchi.  I sampled both and they were great.For dessert we ordered a couple of options, but the Nutella Mousse sticks out as amazing.It is BYOB, making a very affordable DELICIOUS meal.  I can't wait to go back again."
"5.0","Fantastic addition to Bloomfield! Yummy food, friendly customer service, adorable interior. We will definitely be back!"
"4.0","I can't believe more people haven't reviewed Sorrento's! I love this place!I lived on Atwood Street over the summer and ate here probably twice a week. $5 large pizzas, but they are actually GOOD. No, this isn't your authentic Italian pizza or New York style pizza, in fact I'm not sure what exactly it is. But I do know that the crust is crispy yet chewy, the sauce is good (not too-sweet or too-heavy), and there's tons and tons of cheese. I had a friend who worked at a couple different pizza shops in town who said that Sorrento's used the freshest ingredients that he had seen, which probably accounts for its deliciousness. Just go on the earlier side of the $5 deal to miss the bulk of the drunk student crowd.Also their handwritten sign denoting 'Free Wi-Fi' cracks me up every time (yeah, it doesn't take much)."
"5.0","Love it, great beer selection, great food, awesome 6 pack and 12pack deals. Great place I come here a lot now that I live up here. It's becoming once a week at least which is fine by me!!"
"1.0","No air conditioning in restaurant!  Food was good but they shouldn't even be open on a 90 degree day!"
"5.0","Good Food. Outstanding Service. A Classic. Alexander's is an old-school family restaurant/pub in all the best ways.The three of us (me, my wife and our son) arrived to a crowded restaurant that seemed to be filled with people who know each other. People hugging, laughing and talking. I assumed they were all together but it became clear that it was staff talking with various regulars - everyone seemed in a great mood. We sat and before we even had a chance to look at the menu our son was asked if he would like a plate of his own little meatballs. He was super excited about this idea. We were off to a great start. I ordered the chicken parm with a side of pasta. My wife had wedding soup with a make your own pasta combo. The kiddo went with buttered noodles with sauce on the side and the aforementioned meatballs. Everything was quite good. My chicken was crispy, but flavorful and the sauce was well seasoned. The real star of the meal was the Marfredo sauce - a combination of alfredo and marinara sauce. Its crazy delicious. I had it on my pasta side, the wife had it on her meal. Our son ended his meal with a bowl of ice cream and my wife and I split the Tiramisu. The tiramisu wasn't a traditional slice but more of a parfait. It was quite good. A lot of tiramisus are either drowning in brandy or the coffee flavor is overwhelming - this blended them both wonderfully. But while the food was good, the service was simply outstanding. Attentive, friendly and knowledgable staff.Give Alexander's a shot when you're in the mood for an old-school high-quality Italian meal."
"5.0","If one says you eat with your eyes first, you will eat a ton here. The place is great. The food looks warm, fresh, and tasty. Had the Parisian sandwich and was really well-fed for $6. I also took a lemon tarte to go and ate later after dinner. Also delicious. I am already planning my second visit."
"4.0","Nice cafe with unique outside seating. I recommend if you're looking for a casual brunch spot in the area. One thing I wasn't a big fan of is how they served water from mini Costco​ water bottles, but maybe it was a temporary​ thing. I ordered the Mediterranean​ omelet​ and it was delicious. The outside seating area is fun, it has a bunch of rainbow umbrellas​ hanging above to block the sun. ​"
"2.0","I'm guessing this place is under new management and they're struggling to get their footing because my recent experience was a disaster. When we were able to get the attention of the server / manager / whomever, he was super friendly, which is the only reason I'm giving this two stars. The selection has decreased drastically, the draft beers taste as though the lines haven't been cleaned in months, and everything was very slow despite not being busy. I'm bummed, because this was one of my favorite places to just chill. I'll try again in a month or so and see if they have a better handle on things, but I'm not terribly optimistic."
"4.0","I've loved this place for as long as I can remember. Sad it's all the remains of Pittsburgh's Chinatown.For the longest time I haven't been able to get back here and now that I'm wishing walking distance on a daily basis I'll get to make up for that.It's got such a serene atmosphere and it's really a nice way to enjoy a relaxing meal, especially when ducking in from the hustle and bustle of weekday downtown life.Dinner is a nice time as well, relaxed and peaceful. Even if it's super busy at lunch or dinner it's still peaceful.The food of course is the best part. While we have several places in the city and surrounding areas for Chinese cuisine, Chinatown Inn ranks at the top of the list."
"1.0","Extremely slow service waiting for a simple bubble tea to go. Over 10 minutes!  It seems they forgot the order, after getting the payment."
"3.0","Went back here yesterday, seated in the back area which is really nice. Beer was fine. Our waitress seemed to have a chip on her shoulder, she was not very friendly. She was very slow too though I guess she had most of the booths in the back. We had the pierogis which were okay and the buffalo chicken rillettes which were not very good. The presentation of the food is great but in the two times I've been there, the food has been pretty average at best. Will definitely be back but food and service could use some work."
"4.0","Had the chicken sadoko omg it was really good perfectly seasoned and spicy just how I like it! The only thing was the chicken was very dry I think they fry it and it seemed over cooked. Would have been much better with some fresh grilled chicken!"
"4.0","My nephews birthday celebration was my reason to get me into the Azorean Cafe at his suggestion.  I was impressed by the decor and the thought put into it.  Very restful and calming.The food was new for me.  My nephew had the cod casserole which came with roll and it must have been great because I never heard a word out of him and only saw the top of his head until he was finished!As a new-comer, I opted for the American breakfast which came with a side of Chorizo sausage which is never a bad thing.  The eggs were perfectly cooked to order and I had those great homefries which have a bit of spice to them with the onions and the spicy red peppers.The coffee came in huge mugs and was always filled.  The service was pleasant and courteous.  They spoke about their cuisine and explained the origins and resources for their dishes.  It was a great experience and a first time exposure to food of the Azores.  I will be back."
"5.0","This is the best place ever!!! I had some regular spaghetti and it was so good! I recommend this by google maps and I'm so glad! My dad has a pizza and he loved it! It's very friendly and I would recommend this to everyone! This place is like pizza/pasta paradise! The good ol burg has a good restaurant called Little Nipper's II! If you see this tell then your pal mike sent you! Thank you for your food Little Nipper's!"
"5.0","The best Italian in Pittsburgh's Bloomfield area! I love the fact that they make their own pastas to order and my fav is Calamari over choice pasta! Delish fresh calamari not frozen hand breaded and sauce is superb! Like MAMA's! Last time I had restaurant Italian was in Brooklyn NY! This place reminded me of there! My fav desert is Cannoli but didn't see it on menu! I had small Italian coffee w shot of Annisette made whole dinner since it was cold outside! It took me 45 min to get their from SHills by access van but I used to live in Shadyside and would walk to Alexander's in the cold snow for Their pasta! You can make it yourself go buy all ingredients slave over stove but won't be same! Wish we in SHills had this other than Olive Garden which Id never will eat that phony food!"
"5.0","Tried Edgar's at a food truck rally. The tacos were amazing. It has become a goal to stumble upon this food truck again."
"5.0","Very pleasantly surprised by the quality of all the ingredients. The falafel was so well made and I have frequented many NY and LA falafel joints. I couldn't believe there wasn't any cream in my Matcha tea until they explained that they make their own almond milk! It was so rich and guilt free!! We will definitely return to try more!"
"4.0","This is one of those places - it's been there forever, it doesn't need your approval or your patronage, it will outlive us all, the end. We were on our way to the Pirates game and our locals told us it was the thing to do so, even though we were still full from a late lunch, we went there, got some beers, way too many fried oysters, and got the hell out of the way when the check was settled. If you actually are going expecting to enjoy the food - be aware that an order of three lightly seasoned breaded oysters is the equivalent of three White Castle burger-sized oysters (cause they've been pounded flat) smothered in about half a cannister of 4C breadcrumbs and then fried. I think 'stick to your ribs' is an adequate way to describe the sensation I was wrestling with on my way across the Roberto Clemente Bridge. It's also one of those places where if you're trying to eat healthy and you order the salad, you get a styrofoam plate with iceberg and a couple anemic slices of tomato on top. Also, I recall there being some sort of a deal where, if you join the birthday club, you get a Rocky Marciano poster on your big day.So yeah, I'll totally be back!"
"1.0","The 'make your own Bloody Mary' bar might be a good deal if you're good at making bloody mary's. If you're like me, and you suck at making bloody marys, it means you're overpaying for a crappy pour of vodka and are stuck trying to practice alchemy with old/warm/exposed ingredients."
"4.0","Pretty decent New York style pizza, with quick delivery."
"4.0","I don't like seafood. At all. But I like this Pittsburgh landmark. I've been going for years. Why would someone who doesn't eat fish do this? I'll tell you why, because I love the chicken tenders and fries!! Yes just like a kid, I love them. There's nothing unique or fancy about this meal but something about the way it's cooked up makes it delicious. Maybe it's the pride the employees seem to take in what I call job well done. Can't go to Market Square without stopping in."
"2.0","As a person who can rarely turn down Indian food, we swing in here after grabbing some tacos next door at Las Palmas because we wanted to give it a try. They were anything but thrilled about us not wanting to do their buffet. After reluctantly giving us a menu, we split an appetizer because getting anything else would have been much more expensive than both of us getting the buffet (making it look like a good deal). It was good and flavorful, but not a 5 on the spicy scale like we asked for. I never really know how scale the food, especially with Indian, clearly I was very off. I felt uncomfortable the whole time as if we were inconveniencing them despite being the only people in the restaurant. I really wish I had for my place to fix my Indian food craving (that happens way too often) but I will have to keep looking!"
"5.0","I've been here four times in the past week I've been in town for business. This review describes my experiences over the course of my visits. Three times were at the bar, and I had excellent service and food. I had the shaved brussel sprout salad, the French onion soup, a filet mignon, a bone in ribeye, an the salmon on my visits to the bar for dinner. I also bright my wife here when she visited me this past weekend. We sat in the main seating area and had a superb experience. She had a filet mignon, I had a bone in filet. I had my salad and soup for starters and the augratin potatoes and brussel sprouts for sides. We had ice cream for dessert, and it was really good. I highly recommend this place, as you have a very high probability of success for your experience."
"5.0","If you don't like this place, then I don't like you.Amazing food, amazing service, amazing atmosphere.  Get the made to order mozz and everything else."
"3.0","I should start my review by saying that being a vegetarian might not be fair to review this restaurant but in any case for fellow vegetarians, I was somewhat disappointed by lack of flavors in the food. The food lacked umami flavor! :-) service was nice and friendly and I had a very good sake. Another problem with the place was cleaning material with strong chemical odor which was being used constantly as we ate which is really not all that pleasant.  Not sure if I will go back."
"5.0","I love Salem's. The food is excellent and the employees are fantastic. Their service is quick and I am always satisfied with my experience."
"5.0","Great atmosphere, excellent service, must stop before any event at the stadium. Reasonable prices, great food and a fun, party atmosphere.  Football themed menu and decor of course. Bar staff is knowledgeable and helpful."
"5.0","Great little spot.  Not a lot of seating so not for large groups. The guy behind the counter, I wish I caught his name, was great!  He moved quick and took orders quickly he did not slow for a second till everyone was take care off.  The food was fantastic!  3 delicious tacos and a drink for 11 dollars!  It was a cheap and fun date night for us. I suggest walking down to the milk shake factory after for chocolate. It really topped the night off right for us!"
"3.0","I really liked the outdoor seating. The chicken kebab was well prepared, but everything would have been much better with a little bit of yogurt or something else to dip it in. That includes the complimentary pita bread, which was hesitantly given to us by the waiter after request. Beware -- the peppers are very spicy."
"2.0","In my opinion not so good...Huge portions just don't make up for so-so food in my book. I'm always disappointed"
"4.0","A decent spot in Bloomfield. The restaurant space is a little dated and there was an odd smell when we were there. Staff was friendly and service was good. They gave us an oil/pesto mix with our bread, it was fantastic. I had the pasta with the 'Marfredo' sauce (a mix of marina and afredo). The sauce was great and the meatballs were just okay for me. The pasta portions are definitely enough to split or to have some leftovers. Worth checking out."
"1.0","Once again a bad experience.The service was super slow and when we said something the owner/'manager got very defensive.I find the attitude of the staff to be super pretentious.   This place could be nice but the team ruin it."
"5.0","My husband and I shop in the strip district a lot. This is our absolute favorite stop. Everyone is always so friendly, Kevin is always there is is always friendly and so helpful!! This is a must stop for anyone who LOVES a good Bloody Mary it's delicious you have to add the bacon and shrimp to make it complete! The food is always great, consistently great no matter what we get. We went in during restaurant week and had the best fish tacos. Today we stopped in and had the she crab soup and oysters. They know seafood!!!"

"5.0","Walking in the door we were warmly greeted and seated. The place is romantic, cozy and inviting. The craft beer list is on point!! We enjoyed fries with 4 dipping sauces and watching people play games from the Summits in house board game collection. Really really cool place :)You can trust me, I'm in the business ;D"

"4.0","I was thrilled when I learned that Morcilla now offers lunch on both Sat and Sun between 11-2 pm. I was anxious to try out the food from Chef Severino who also is the chef at Cure in Upper Lawrenceville.Although I had made a reservation when I arrived the place was virtually empty so the hostess seated me immediately. As I walked past the bar area I noticed that the montaditos were encased for full viewing which would help me decide which one I wanted to try. Montaditos are various cured meat toppings on toasted bread.My waiter helped me interpret the menu and told me about the more popular dishes. I wanted the main course of bacalao which is salted black cod that came with cauliflower catalan,and capers and other items. Since I wanted to try I dessert I opted for a lighter motaditio which was sobrasada. This item had spreadable smoked salami, with apple and hazelnut. Since I love ice tea I was pleased when they offered me their version which is made with red rooibos, saffron, and caramel for flavoring. While I was waiting for my food I could see the hanging meat at the bar area. My food was served very quickly and I was told what it was upon presentation. The sobrasada was very spicy and had a smoked taste to it. I got my bacalao next. This meal was cooked to perfection good! It also had a bit of a smoked taste to it.Portion sizes tend to be small but this is what I would expect in a higher end restaurant. I noticed that dress is very casual for lunch.The place has that Spanish feel about you. After I had finished my main course I opted for dessert. For $9.00 you get a choice of either churros or frozen crema catalana. I chose the latter since my waiter explained that it would be like a frozen creme brulee on top of a pine nut cookie. It was so good I was scraping the sides to get every morsel of it!Many of the meats that are served here are raw so please note that when ordering. It is also noted on the bottom of the menu.  When I completed my meal they allowed me to take the menu home to show my family for a future visit. The staff is both knowledgeable and professional. My waiter made me feel very welcome here.This is definitely a place where you can run up a high tab if you're not careful, however, for me I usually like to frequent places like this for lunch over dinner since lunch prices tend to be a bit less. Morcilla is located in lower Lawrenceville. Metered street parking is available."
"5.0","My absolute favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh!  Great staff and amazing food!  A must stop destination in the Strip. Kevin my server is great!"
"4.0","A Walnut Street gem! We visited with a large group on a Tuesday night for my friend's birthday. The recommended coming later in the night so we arrived at 8:00 and were seated right away. The restaurant is small so be prattled to wait if you do have a larger party and want to visit around 7 or 7:30. We started with the mushroom bruschetta. Great dish to share. Each entree comes with soup or salad. The dinner salad is really large and flavorful. For dinner I had the spinach ricotta ravioli - delicious! The only downside is the portion is small, but the with the mushroom bruschetta it was enough. This well worth making the trip to Shadyside. The food is delicious and the intimate atmosphere makes for the perfect date night."
"4.0","The food is excellent and the portions are generous. Beware if you modify your order though- it comes out wrong more often than not. Still, if you're going to order straight off the menu, it's the best Thai place in Bloomfield."
"5.0","If you are in or around Pittsburgh and want delicious snacks... immediately find your way here! The service is great, the food is absolutely amazing, the owner is the sweetest, the beer is cold, you won't be sorry!"
"4.0","In the past 6 months I have come to the Yard three times and I had the same waitress each visit. She alone makes my visit here wonderful with her funny jokes and her attentiveness towards her customers. It could be borderline overwhelming how attentive she is, but that's being modest of the great service. The place itself is lively with the jukebox right in front of the door, but for anyone who is looking to chat with a friend or do business, don't be alarmed. The music does not get carried over immensely to the dining area. What really attracts me to the Yard of course is the GRILLED CHEESE! For an average of $11 to have a huge gourmet grilled cheese, tomato soup, and your choice of fries is a bargain. Not to mention they have DAILY specials! We came in on half off wine and $4 whiskey. It was definitely worth every penny I spent. For any BBQ lovers the Smack Yo Mama grilled cheese is heavenly sweet and the pulled chicken has a nicer texture than pulled pork. Lastly the Cause We Got High dessert is hands down one of the best desserts to get if you're a huge chocolate fan, willing to get diabetes, or to have as a sweet topping on a nice evening out drinking."
"5.0","I'm not sure why this place has terrible reviews, but it was excellent. Also my boyfriend is Chinese, and he went with me---so not white washed review. The noodles were excellent, and served hot. The pork buns were delicious. The pork belly sandwich was ok. I didn't really enjoy it because there were too many chives in it for my taste, but my bf says that's how it's served. We had fast and good service. A couple minutes after seating, she took our order, gave us water and utensils just a couple minutes later. We got our food promptly despite the restaurant being packed. Unlike other reviewers we had a completely different experience. Will definitely return!!!"
"5.0","Rialto has never let me down.  We've had pizza,  sandwiches pierogie and various sides and appetizers here over the years and have never had a complaint.  Delivery is fast and takeout is always ready when they say it will be. My only complaint is that they don't have a second location on Butler."
"5.0","AMAZING Food and great service. We stopped by during a conference with a medium sized group and we're treated very well. Will return."
"5.0","For me, this is one of those places where I want go around to each table and ask randos if I can taste their dinner, just so I can try everything! It's delish, it's super affordable, it's quiet (and you all know how I love quiet), and the staff are so wonderful.The BF and I have been going her for years. Why I haven't written a review is beyond me, but we went for dinner and I thought...I really have to share this place. The food is absolutely phenomenal, and I mean PHENOMENAL. I have never had anything here that didn't make me want to run in the kitchen and start licking the pots and pans. As a rule, I usually get the Pad Thai, because, well, it's Pad Thai, possibly the best dish on the planet. But I have tried other things here, and if you like different curries, this is place to get brave. The pumpkin curry is so out-of-this-world. Pumpkin Curry! Yeah. I never thought I'd say that about a pumpkin curry, but it's true! It's now one of my favorite dishes. The stir fries -i.e. eggplant basil, basil leaves- are both awesome as well. We've tried almost all the apps and sometimes I dream about going and just ordering all the apps. Well, maybe two orders of fish cakes. Yeah, fish cakes! The old me would have never even tasted something called a fish cake, but here I am, salivating at the thought of them. This place has truly changed my idea of what delicious is."
"4.0","Pleasantly surprised! Great food and service. My only complaint is the same as other people have said, the wonton soup. The broth is good however, the wonton's are not stuffed with anything so it's basically broth with wonton skins. Everything else was great! Highly recommend if you are in the area."
"1.0","My parents and I came here after my dad had boasted about how good there food was and that he would bring his HP customers here for lunch. Upon arrival we immediately were ignored so we ended up seating ourselves. The place was unacceptably dirty, our table was dirty the floor was dirty, heck even the walls seemed to have a layer of grime. Both the waitress and the bartender were extremely  rude. My mom and I got a beer and my dad tried to order a martini, immediately we received dirty looks from both the bartender and the waitress, they said they didn't have them so my dad asked for straight vodka in a glass to which she brought a shot  of vodka instead. I understand it's not a full bar or a classy place but to serve alcohol and react the way the servers did was ridiculous! I ordered a grilled fish sandwich that lacked flavor and was horrible greasy, the fried scallops were disgusting.I understand that the restaurant has seen better days but wow, will i be going back, methinks not!"
"1.0","Working downtown, Redbeards is a go to happy hour spot for me and my co workers. We called ahead as we always have and requested they reserve tables. We had a large party, about 15-20 ppl coming at various times. On the phone they said okay, as this has never been a problem. Well today we get there at 3:45 and as we walk up the steps a gentleman in a blue button down shirt who i assume was the manager starts shooing us back down the stairs telling us we cannot come up there until 4pm. This has never happened. When they finally let us upstairs they had ONE table with about 8 chairs even tho we told them ahead of time how many ppl we had. There were several empty tables surrounding us but we were told we couldn't take them because they were reserved for other people as they expected to be busy due to the pirate game. This was odd to me because we were paying customers and they were making us stand when there were empty tables available? Well no one ever came to occupy them so we ended up just sitting there because standing was getting old. Our waiter did his best considering but the manager was SO RUDE and it ended up being chaotic. I think we'll take our happy hours elsewhere."

"4.0","Bringing me back to college days- Marios is the less dungeony cousin to the old Playwright in New Haven... Actually I feel that the entire Carson st. street is very similar to the crown st. area in New Haven. My first time in Pittsburgh led me to conclude the following-A. Big Big folksB. Friendly folks smoking cigarettesC. Jag-off is a word equal to the NYC Guidish term 'haahd-On'D. These people love bridges almost as much a cigarettesE. People can recognize Johnny Rod from W.A.S.P.F. Dont order a Vodka tonic and expect to talk to chicksG.

"4.0","SETTINGExtremely spacious with an earthy feel. Wooden floors, wooden chairs and tables. Mostly small tables for two. There is a couch/coffee table in front of a fireplace and larger table in the back. Free wifi. This review is mostly for Arnold's atmosphere, since I was here to do some work. This place just opened, so it was not crowded at all. A great thing for me, but I'm sure they will get busier one word gets out. Shhh! I almost had the whole place to myself! For now, the non-busy and spacious feel of Arnold's Tea is what makes this establishment special. That and the soft smooth jazz (I love me some sultry sax and laidback jams) playing in the background. Exactly what I needed.DRINKSI had the 'Arnold on the green' which was green tea and lemonade. I liked how light and refreshing it was. Not too sweet and exactly how I imagined it would taste like. They also have a selection of sandwiches and pastries. On the back wall is a shelf of jars with tea leaves where you could buy tea leaves that ranged from your typical ones to the more exotic.IMPRESSIONSI would come back to study and do work here. Again, the big open space and jazz music sealed the deal for me. You would never see me studying at Starbucks, Crazy Mocha, or the other chains because they are the complete opposite--crowded and noisy. Instead of sophisticated jazz, I hear unsophisticated gossip and obnoxious laughter. On repeat. Worst playlist ever. Arnold's is the antithesis, and a small business. I respect that. Despite my desire to keep this place hush hush, so I can have this place to myself again, I encourage you to check it out if you need a place to lounge and get some work done."
"4.0","Of the several places to get bagels in Oakland, these bagels are the best. Really fresh and tasty and they taste homemade.However, I wasn't crazy about their bagel and egg sandwiches."
"4.0","My boyfriend and I were craving Chinese food while we were in town for the weekend, and boy, am I glad I found this gem! It's on a random side street and not very close to anything else in downtown and from the looks of the outside, I was skeptical of the place. But from the service to the food, it was delicious enough for us to go back AGAIN before leaving Pittsburgh! We started our order with fried pork dumplings which were pretty good. Not too doughy and ample meat inside. Then we ordered the Mongolian Beef which was fantastic, the sauce alone was tasty enough to just eat by itself with some rice! We also got Pork fried rice which was probably one of the best I've had ever (and I eat a lot of Chinese food)! I also got the General Tso's chicken which was a HUGE order and I felt so bad we couldn't take the rest home since we were staying at a hotel! The second time we went back, we got the Mongolian beef again and Pork Egg Foo Young. The only thing I wish was improved, was the gravy for the egg foo young. I'm used to having the creamy brown gravy and they serve it with a watery dark brown base which took away from the flavor I'm used to. All in all, I would recommend this place for an inexpensive and quick fix for your Chinese takeout cravings!"
"3.0","It's not in the middle of anything but I liked the old school feel and they had a good pizza special. The pizza was really good I would probably stop there again if I'm in the area. It actually feels like your in NY with the decor"
"5.0","This bakery was a very good surprise. I'm very happy to give this excellent bakery 5 stars. I went here to get dessert for friends and everyone celebrate stop talking about how good the dessert was so it was a great success for me. I got the apple pie which was simply amazing. Strongly recommend you get this. If you take it home, I recommend serving it with vanilla ice cream. In addition I got 2 almond croissants. The filling was generous and the croissant itself delicious. You could really taste the butter but in a good way. Definitely will come here again. Only wish they were open on weekends. Bottom line, If you get the chance do yourself a favor and stop here."
"4.0","Visiting Pittsburgh for the first time, Yelp pointed us in the right direction towards Pamela's for breakfast.It passed the 'parking lot' or rather waiting room test and was packed to the the brim on Saturday at 11am... Perfect, this means we are at the right place for a good breakfast. Only a short wait later we were seated comfortably at a table.Great signage to say that they were a 'CASH ONLY' establishment. Thanks for not making it awkward at the end....Overall the food was excellent. I had a Hotcake with Walnuts and Bananas... I wished it came with some sort of side because I was still hungry afwards.  My friend had a omelet with home fries which she said was delicious as well.It wasn't life changing and innovative, but the food was excellent for a brunch location in Pittsburgh. Loved Walnut street as well. Beautiful location for a breakfast spot.Parking wasn't so bad either! See you next time Pamela's!"
"4.0","My favorite bar restaurant in shady-side! Liked my food overall and the atmosphere is good. My only complaint is the music gets a bit loud at night, but otherwise I like the feel. Best to go during afternoon, before the music gets too loud. The staffs are friendly!We like sitting at the bar - and it helps when they have my favorite drink on tap, bumble berry from fat heads!In terms of food, their pierogi with bacon bits are delicious! Gives a nice and flavorful taste to the pierogi. Also, the shrimp appetizer is pretty good, but the dipping sauce is nothing special. If you are okay with eating unhealthy, the soft pretzel is not bad, but be warned, it is literally deep fried! Out of everything we've had, the chicken sandwich however, is nothing special. Regardless, I would love to go back again to try more food with my beer.Before I forget, they have some nice big miller light (i believe) drinks for a nice deal at night. Unfortunately I don're remember the details. But I will be back, and hopefully find out next time."
"5.0","I really enjoyed Burgh'ers Brewing! The night I was there, they were collaborating with Pizza Talarico (I think?) so we could eat pizza or burgers. I thought this was such a cool concept. I'm pretty plain so I went with a bacon, egg and cheese mini burger, and I got a side of cheese sauce and dipped the burger into it. It was so good. I definitely suggest dipping it in the cheese if you're into that. The fries were a treat- super crispy. I was really impressed."
"1.0","The only thing worse than the ticket times in this place is the attitude. If you want to wait an hour for eggs and still not get them, then get screamed at by the staff for leaving, this place is for you. Save your money and go elsewhere."
"2.0","Have downsized their pizzas, though not their prices. I have been ordering regularly from them, but now I need to find a new place, because this last experience was not good. They did make their 'Medium' into what used to be 'Small' - so less for the the same price. And when it arrived, it was extremely thin on toppings. Still tasted fine, but clearly a move is on to reduce the value that you get from them."
"4.0","A limited menu but a stellar showing on the items we tried. The coffee was mellow and tasty, and offered a pleasant accompaniment to our breakfast. We shared a shrimp croquette (creamy, shrimpy, crunchy), cod bites (tasty potato and cod morsels), and the bacalau. Everything was very rich but also quite tasty. We aren't big pork eaters, but their menu has lots of pork options. Also, with an obligate GF diner, they were extra careful and checked on all of the menu items (the shrimp croquette wasn't GF, but everything else we ordered was!). I'll be back when I'm craving some tasty Azorean fare."
"4.0","This Pamela's has a much different environment than the one in Oakland. This had a much more intimate feel and was a lot smaller and less 'diner' -esque. The morning after breakfast special was pretty good with 2 large hotcakes (important sidenote: if a pancake and a crepe had children I would imagine this is what their child would look like, the outside and edges are crispy but it's thick enough to be considered a pancake). The eggs were also of epic proportions but the bacon was quite scarce. A measly two and a half pieces...The jumbo tossed salad was built for a king - it was brought out in the large mixing bowl that they tossed that sucker in. I asked for cheddar and dressing on the side and it was quite scrumptious."
"4.0","I went here after an art crawl. It was beautiful outside and they had the side doors open to the air.My waiter was very helpful and knowledgeable. They gave me a water decanter on my table, but when my glass was empty they still came to the table to fill my glass.The menu changes seasonally.  I ordered ricotta gnudi appetizer. It was a rolled and stuffed cheese with apple butter and seasonal ingredients,  it was good.I also ordered the Bacon and Egg pizza with maple syrup. It tasted like breakfast! I sat by the window and people watched in the open air. Very relaxing.This is the second floor of 3 floors of Sienna Mercato."
"1.0","Corporate look and feel. Acts the part. Bad music. Staff wasn't friendly, took them forever to clean our table, seat us and even longer to take our order. Won't be coming back."
"4.0","I go here before Pens games or shows. Drinks are amazing and so is the food! Sometimes it's hard to get the bartenders attention...sometimes you have to walk around and find her/him. Overall, it's a cool place to come before or after events at Consol."
"5.0","Not having ordered anything from here other than breakfast or burgers (which I highly recommend--though they're only served outside in the summer), I treated myself to the 'Porkgasm' sandwich today.  I was disappointed when my sandwich was handed to me, as it felt a bit lighter than the sandwiches I get elsewhere.  However, when I got back to my desk and had my Porkgasm--er, ate my Porkgasm sandwich--I was more than okay with trading volume for quality.  It was a delicious sandwich and I'll be back to sample the rest of the menu.UPDATE:  Craftwork started grilling tacos outside recently and these are also AWESOME.  I'm a taco traditionalist, but I enjoy the hell out of the Pescado Baja (Mahi Mahi) tacos as well as the Carne Asada (steak) and Pollo Tradicional (chicken).  Yes, these tacos are pricier than the Qdoba variety, but also much, much better."
"5.0","All I can say is that I will never be eating at any other restaurant in what's left of my entire life. The food is just THAT GOOD and I'm not even vegan. I usually base my food choices on 'is it piping hot' and 'does it have a lot of different awesome sauces that aren't mayonnaise' and the answer here is yes to both. I did have a little wait, even though it was an off-peak time and not gonna lie a lot of the staff has this kind of felinic vibe that pretty much dares you to get them to care but they get the job done, aren't always in your face and kinda warm up to you in the end. I got some sort of pick-three pita dish and I feel there was enough food for two really hungry people or 4 somewhat hungry friends. there was plenty of warm pita in a covered basket and the hummus did not look like a cat just threw up which being realistic can happen some times. I took about 1/2 of it home, went to work a hockey game and then realized I still had some left over so pulled over to write this review in praise. If there is one bad thing it is the carry out containers don't stay closed when you close them or stay open when you open them but they looked biodegradable so I'll give them a pass and bring a rubber band next time."
"5.0","I have always liked meditaranian food but its very hard to find a place that serves authentic and delicious."
"5.0","Probably the BEST pancakes and hash we have ever had!!  The combination of blueberries and ricotta was amazing.  Do not pass this spot by---"
"5.0","Came here during lunchtime after stopping by the post office across the street. I ordered a lamb kabob sub and was pleasantly surprised by how good it turned out to be. Idk about the other reviews but the lamb was definitely good quality meat and their service was fast and reliable (~10 min to make the sandwich)."
"3.0","I wish I could give Ki Ramen a better rating. The  environment was warm and inviting. Our server was pleasant, informative, and attentive. The reason I'm only giving a '3' rating is that I was disappointed with the actual food. We shared the vegi Bao and enjoyed it. It had just the right amount of heat and good flavor.   We also shared the  Dan Dan ramen.  Ramen is all about the broth. Even though we ordered the added 'butter bomb', which supposedly added richness and flavor, I found the broth bland and lacking in the 'mouth -feel' that you expect. The ramen noodles were just sort of 'there.' The tofu was rubbery and flavorless, and the additional ingredients (kim chi, scallions, sprouts, and nitamago were skimpy. The dish just didn't cut it. The price, $12 wasn't terrible, but if you added a few of the add ons, Ki Ramen started becoming expensive for what you got. I'll probably give Ki Ramen another chance because I really love ramen.  But if my next experience isn't significantly better, I'll cross this place off my list"
"4.0","very nice Nepali food.. must try MOMO. usually people get confused with Nepali and Chinese food. though they are having similar dishes, it won't taste like Chinese food since it has some indian influence. i would highly recommend this place as Nepali food and not to compare with Indian or Chinese food. this is the most authentic Nepali food..owner is very humble, doesn't care much about money. I've seen him many times charging me less than what he supposed to  (may be because i eat there often)."
"4.0","Have I just been completely unobservant, or do they purposely make their buffet an inside secret that only regulars know about? We came here near closing time on a Friday night, wondering if we could get anything before they closed. We casually asked about lamb shank, and the guy told us that we can get it when the buffet starts. Now the heating counters at the back made sense! So I guess they do this buffet on Friday nights after the regular closing time--whether this was a special event or one that is more regular on other days, I have no idea. I don't recall seeing any other signs or reading other Yelp reviews about this.So we stayed and waited about half an hour (they didn't officially get started until past 8:20), and people kept pouring in over the next hour until the place completely filled up. At $15 a person (they price by the pound if you take out), it really was a good bargain. Most of their items are the same as on the regular menu, but what really stuck out was the lamb shank that we originally wanted. Huge bones with a lot of flavorful attached meat. What more can you want? Some of the chicken items were pretty dry, so I'll probably avoid that for future visits. They also bring out some soups, desserts, and a salad and fruit bar. So this was a pretty standard (but awesome) buffet."
"1.0","Service was absolutely brutal, there was one person giving obviously minimal portions to save money, and she attempted to over charge us. Just don't go here or sucks"
"1.0","Saddest brunch I've ever had. Ordered chorizo scramble with no onions, got onions. Happens to me all the time when i go out and I just assumed it was premade with the pico and rolled with it. However my date and her friend ordered chicken and waffles, this is where it was basically bad to worse. Starting off with the 3 saddest pieces of chicken I've ever seen. One girl actually offered the other some of her chicken but she really didn't have much to give. Worst part was when my date reached her last bite to find what looked like carpet fiber. Mortified obviously because who knows what she DIDNT see. The food also took forever but the waitress was nice. Probably won't be going back, $65 for that experience just doesn't cut it. Manager or whoever just kinda shrugged it off which compelled me to write this. Douche."
"5.0","Definitely the best breakfast I've had in Pittsburgh so far. Highly recommend. Great menu and fast service!"
"3.0","Love this place. Have met the owner(s) who are also super hospitable and down to earth. Cool art on the walls. Really diverse menu with options for all walks. Blending of Asian-influenced meals to classic dishes. Freshest squeezed juice in the city too- and at a reasonable price. Their bloody mary's are on point above par. Unfortunately had a terrible experience, which heavily skewed the review. Waited 38 minutes between ordering and getting plated. The beef in the bimbapbap was actually inedible. I had to remove it from the dish, basically paying $15 for a rice bowl. It was not busy but we were forgotten about with no water or coffee refills. Then when asking for a box, they threw out the only meal worthy of boxing to go. They graciously didn't charge for the 2 coffees...That said, I'll still continue to visit and patronize them. Who knows what created that mess- a redemption is deserved though. Hopefully the staff is not the same next time."
"1.0","DISAPPOINTING. First, and last time, stopping here for lunch takeout. I ordered the 'super burger' which was the worst burger I have ever eaten in my life. Shouldn't say eaten, because it was full of gristle and I had to throw it away."
"4.0","I really like the atmosphere of this place. The beer and drink selection is great, and I have always enjoyed the food! There is always a good crowd of people there, but the wait has never been too bad. I was just there for dinner the other evening and had the chicken tacos- they were pretty good-but I previously had the barbecue chicken salad-and would def recommend that! Despite it being crowded and our server being pretty miserable, the food and drinks were all served pretty quickly."
"4.0","Had a get-together here. Loved the beer and the atmosphere. On the rooftop there is a clear roof that opens and closes above you, so if its rainy you can still chill out and drink. Very cool!"
"5.0","Thank you Yuzu for serving your ramen take out. I've eaten in a few times but don't want to deal with parking and eating downtown. Been waiting for PIttsburgh to replicate the ippudo kuro-obi quick service bars in NYC I ordered take out twice this weekend and both times it was complete perfection. Ive tried both chicken ramens and love the shoyu tare preparation the best. My husband loves the rayu. The leftovers heat up so well and this is def my favorite place in Pittsburgh right now for this type of food."
"5.0","A nice warm bowl of ramen is exactly what you need on a cold winter night! We've been wanting to go to Ki Ramen after hearing great things about it and finally had the chance last night. I started with the beet Kim chi because I love beets and man, was that delicious! I ordered the shoyu ramen bowl and my husband got the inferno bowl. The bowls were delicious but we did wish there was more ramen to soak up the rest of the broth. No complaints though, we both loved them and next time if we're real hungry we'll get extra noodles. We also finished with the donut bao's and I could have eaten like 5 of those, they were so good! Ki Ramen also carries local brews and cider which is always a nice thing to see, plus we had great service. We will most definitely be back!!"
"5.0","Best food on carson street! And a wonderful atmosphere. The service is always amazing. The food is always fresh and the portions are huge. One of my personal favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh."
"3.0","Very dissapointing, i love the original Primanti Bros, but the booth at PNC park is not in the same league, i suppose the sandwiches are bulk made & kept under a heater, just not that great, but stilll better than average ballpark fare..... Served with IC lite, possibly the worst beer in America."
"2.0","Note to self.  Take Mexican off the cuisine types to have in Pittsburgh.  Nothing can ever compare to the authentic, cheap, and just plain good stuff in the Mission.  I went into the dinner & drinks with low expectations because I was excited to see friends.The margaritas are overly sweet and syrupy, but the bartender that served them is HAUTE!We started the dinner off with chips & guac, and the guac was definitely the blandest I've ever had missing the core elements of salt, lime, flavor.  I brought it to the waitress's attention and requested salsa to spice it up.  We incorporate the lime wedges from the margaritas and some salt, which made it edible.For our entree, we ordered 2 rounds of tacos.  The fish was ok, batter was very flavorful, but much too heavy.  The carnitas was over cooked and dried out.  Just not good.Service was decent, and the prices weren't bad, but I would never return.  Even for the HAUTE bartender."
"5.0","Great happy hour here. They have both drink and food specials. We had the fried pickles which were great! I would definitely go back here for their happy hour."
"4.0","I have been meaning to try out Coca Cafe for some time now, and my friend brought me here for an end of the semester brunch celebration.  Yay for finishing my first year of graduate school!There is no atmosphere to Coca Cafe, which I would have expected from the hipster-ish menu.  It's what I would refer to as upscale Yinzer atmosphere.  The tables are too close together so people will continuously run into you, and there will be children screaming at the tops of their lungs while their parents ignore them.  However, there are some really unique food options and the servers are pleasant enough.I ordered an omelette with pesto, tomatoes, and feta.  It was presented very prettily, and there was a cute orange slice to give it some more color.  I wouldn't order this again necessarily, as it was too salty for my taste.  I did enjoy it, but I would prefer to try something else next time.  My friend got shrimp grits, which she raved about.Overall, I totally prefer Coca Cafe to Square Cafe is Regent Square, and I would say that is the closest equivalent."
"5.0","The homemade Italian is very good. Authentic. We go quite a bit. We sit outside often with our dog. Ask for Delaney or Steph. They do a great job waiting on us. Try it."
"4.0","We came here on a Saturday night, where there was only one server on duty. But she was attentive. The place has a great ambiance. We really liked our food. I had the best whiskey sour I've had in a long time. We'll be back!PS There are games available for the customers!"
"5.0","Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. Staff was nice, facility looked brand new and super clean. Highly recommend."
"5.0","Best food and service ever! I have never tasted hummus so delicious! The lamb just melted and tender - clean- nice atmosphere"
"4.0","I enjoyed this place. It's a simple setup and a straightforward Mediterranean style menu. The entrees don't include hummus, but if you order it as an appetizer you'll have enough to last at least three people through their meals.The pita is served warm too. Which I know is something little, but it's a nice touch that makes a big difference to me.Service was good too. We got our food reasonably quick, and our waiter was very courteous and attentive."
"1.0","Customer service is terrible.  Wanted to charge me 15$ for a medium pizza, when a large is 7.99.  Manager actually hung up the phone on me.  Place is a dump, and they have screwed up orders in the past"
"5.0","YUM! The people here were very friendly while we ordered our tacos, and the massive range of vegetarian options is fab! Instead of just one veggie taco option (like beans and cheese) they had a soyrizo option to compliment the omnivorous chorizo taco.SOYrizo. Get it? It was quite good.These tacos are super messy, so don't trick yourself into thinking you can eat and drive with these guys... take a seat nearby and enjoy!"
"5.0","A true hidden gem. Excellent service, fantastic international food with a broad variety ranging from Far East to South American to a fresh take on local favorites.  Relaxed atmosphere. Well-balanced cocktails."
"3.0","This location offers good food and seems rather clean compared to other locations I have been to.  You can't go wrong with a Frisco Breakfast Sandwich for a quick cheap breakfast while on the run.  I reccommend this location if you are in the area."
"5.0","A wonderful vegan cafe with a Mediterranean theme, great food and attentive service. All the food is prepared fresh. Although mostly Mediterranean cuisine, the chef uses some creative tweaks to keep the food vegan. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu, and passionate about the food. The were no missteps common to a brand new opening, except the restaurant is more wildly popular than they could have thought and by the end of the day they were all out of soup.Pittsburghers have been looking forward to more vegan and vegetarian food, I'm sure they will embrace this marvelous new cafe."
"1.0","No cleanliness. Came at 9 PM on weekday, already started cleaning (closing time was 10). They said they will still serve. The person doing the mopping didn't wash hands and gave me menu card and then water  I left the place."
"3.0","I agree...parking nightmare.  Would be better if you walked here.  Also do not attempt to go here on a Saturday or Sunday if you don't like long lines."
"5.0","This. Place. Throws. Down! Its been one of my go to spots since they opened. Literally everything on the menu is great. Theres somethin for everyone, whether you want to play it safe or try something new. The chicharron and broccolli rabe are both one of the best sandwiches ive had. Good beer selection and good drinks. Really cool design concept as well, paying tribute to all the streets surrounding carson. If you eat here, you will not leave dissappointed"
"1.0","So first time here and ordered a cappuccino and veggie omelet. The waitress brought my 'cappuccino' that looked more like a latte. I asked to confirm this was the cappuccino, and she said 'yes that's how I make my cappuccino.'.....Next, my veggie omelet came and I expected the cheese to be melted, but it was not. I guess they do things very differently at Caffe Mona La Bistro. The owner was generous enough to comp our meal. Thank you but it's a no for me."
"5.0","I'm a Chicagoan, so I'm not gonna give you the Official Pittsburgh Line™ that you have to go to Primanti Bros. Yes, P-Bros is an Experience, and my life is greatly improved for having had said experience. But when it comes to the better corn beef on rye, it's Sammy's hands down.The quality of the ingredients was off the charts good. Even the pickle on the side was unbelievable--and from the same local producer since Sam first opened up shop 31 years ago.Its exactly what you want in a neighborhood bar, down to the neon signs in the window, the nostalgic mix of old timey black and white regional photos and Penguins and Steelers memorabilia plastered across the walls every 3 inches, and complete with the aloof but still affable owner, counting money and slinging beers behind the bar.tl;dr: I highly recommend anything that comes with a pickle."
"2.0","We wanted to love this place. Out trying new places. We ordered spinach and artichoke dip to start and I've never had more stale chips and the dip was ice cold... we won't be back!"
"5.0","I came to Caffe Mona on a weekday during the summer, and sat on the back patio. It was really tranquil and lovely - I sat, read my book, and enjoyed a savory mushroom crepe for lunch. It's small and cozy, and it kind of seems family-run, which only further endears itself to me. I don't know what it's like on a weekend (possibly much busier), but on a weekday during the summer, it was just what I needed."
"4.0","Been there many times with friends who live in south side...on of the better bars iv been too...just wish they would ban smoking in Penn..."
"5.0","This place is my favorite bar in all of Lawrenceville. It is not uppity or pretentious at all. It is one of the only old time Lawrenceville bars in the area. When I was unemployed I came to Hambone's ever day to use the free internet, order a cup of tea, and maybe an appetizer. The waitress/waiters were friendly and nice, even though they knew that I wouldn't be ordering much. They even offered tips on where/how to appy. Everytime someone comes to visit me I try to take them to Hambone's. The atmosphere is just fantastic. Yeah, it might be a little run down, but that is the best part!Drinks and food are cheap and good! They have live music and comedy nights throughout the week.Stop in, you won't be disappointed."
"5.0","Favorite Thai in the City of Bridges. What would I recommend? Everything. Just spin the menu and throw your finger down. Whatever fate has in store will make your day. But I guess if fate is taking a day off I would choose any of the salmon or eggplant or pumpkin varieties. They never pique me."
"5.0","Have eaten here a handful of times and have had excellent service each time with the exception of once.Week night, small crowd, older waitress who I never saw working there is out front talking with people, sees me walk in, and proceeds to chat until a bigger group of people stroll in. Doesn't acknowledge me, takes their orders first, so I left. Ehh, whatever (maybe I should've spoken up).Came back a few days later for the awesome cinco de mayo special and everything was back to normal. Keep up the good work guys (just try to pay attention when customers come in).Probably the best tacos in the burgh if you're looking for a quick bite. Wish they served alcohol and had seating to accommodate more people but then again, they're surrounded by bars so I can appreciate the dedication to serving up some great grub.Again, keep grinding... I see a lot of potential to expand and prosper.Update: The service and food here continues to be excellent. When asked where to grab a great taco in the city, I always point friends and familiy toward Doce. Five stars."
"3.0","As a Pittsburgh person with limited Mexican cuisine experience, Las Velas is good solid Mexican food.I've been pleased with my lunches.  You have to get there quick though, otherwise there will be a line and a wait."
"5.0","incredible amounts of flavor in everything we ordered.  Really warm atmosphere and staff....  As a bonus, later that night: best leftovers ever.   I need to go back with a team of 6-8 friends so I can taste everything on the menu"
"5.0","We discovered this place in the past year and have been back several times.  We have yet to order an item we did not like/love.  The meat is always super tender.  So many of the items we have tried are phenomenal.  Some of the items I highly recommend include (but not limited to) Hungarian Goulash, Stewed Beef, and Chicken Paprikás.  Check if they have any Lángos available (it's a special) and give it a try as an appetizer. We have yet to experience any of the events they offer but plan to do so.It's not a large place but does have room for a larger party if that's what you plan.  I've been there for lunch or dinner and will recommend either.  In and out for lunch in under an hour is not a problem."
"2.0","Great Bar, Great bartenders, great food, NO AC DURING FOOTBALL GAMES AT THE BAR!!!  3 people left already because of t, people complained so they opened the door, lol, 90 degrees outside"
"5.0","This is a review for the 'private events' floor of Cafe Raymond! My friend graduated from law school and hosted a graduation party on the second floor. This room appeared to be specifically designed for private events. The space was large enough to fit 50-75 people, yet cozy enough to create a warm, intimate feel. The highlight of the space was the attached balcony seating that overlooks the Strip District. It was the perfect place to admire the hustle and bustle of the busy streets below. The food was delicious - a wide variety of sandwiches, fruits, pasta salads, bacon covered shrimp etc.It was the perfect location for a celebration. I would highly recommend booking this location for future events"
"4.0","My friends are vegan and are taking me to vegan cafes. This is pretty great place except they close early which I experienced several times."
"2.0","Got the braised pork belly over rice dish to go for lunch one day - the pork belly is overly fatty and salty and there is way too much rice compared to other ingredients. Not terrible but it put me to sleep right after so I will probably not order it again. A good price for lunch though and I was able to avoid the automatic service charge people seem to be getting."
"4.0","Always great wings. Prices are comparable to their other locations. No fear, the wings taste great too. Just as if you were in a full service location."
"5.0","What a find!  Possibly the best burger in Pittsburgh.  Locally sourced ingredients, really delicious burgers in perfect proportions, amazing fries, and fine in-house brews as well as the best local beers.   Also features excellent service and plenty of non-burger options.  You can find larger burgers elsewhere but not a better flavor profile and reasonable prices. Spread the word about this gem in Lawrenceville."
"4.0","This is the third Ruth Chris I've been to. The steak was delicious as usual, but the service and overall atmosphere was a little off. The other locations I've visited have been located in casinos and I have to say they are more laid back and comfortable. You didn't feel like you had to whisper to your dinner mates. The only food complaint I have is that the asparagus was very large and barely warm. But luckily the bread and potatoes were more than enough to go with my steak. Parking here is free if you can find the lot. There was no mention of the parking online or when I made the reservation. So we paid for parking and had to walk a few blocks."
"4.0","I went here because I wanted a nice light and healthy lunch. I chose the make your own salad. I chose my salad base, for add ins I ordered garbanzo beans, beets, been mix, and edamame and goat cheese.  You also get a nice slice of bread with it. To drink, lime LaCroix for $1."
"2.0","Terrible service. Hostess takes us to our table but does not give us menus.  Server finally decides to show up and asks if we are ready to order LOL.  Um maybe if we had menus. Then the menu we get have old items in them that you can't order.  Server doesn't know why they don't have new ones.  It's been this way for a long time.  Nice. I order a chocolate martini with whipped cream. Drink was good but the whipped cream is 'flat' by the time I get it. Takes forever to get our meals.  Another table saw how ticked off we were getting (same thing happened to them) that they grabbed the manager on their way out. Pasta with shrimp was just ok.  Shrimp was good size where my husband had shrimp Alfredo and they basically gave him salad shrimp.  We complained (which I hate doing but they were the same price !!). They took his off the bill."
"5.0","The whole experience was wonderful. I was a little worried when we got there because we asked to be seated somewhere else and the hostess was definitely not happy about it. When we pay good money for a meal I expect the best of service. Our waiter, Travis, was the best. Very knowledgeable and courteous. I would love to have him again when we return. We had their speciality pineapple vodka soaked cocktail. Delicious. We ordered two appetizers, the crab cakes and calamari with spicy peppers. Both tasted wonderful. I would suggest eating the crab cakes first because the peppers from the calamari slightly took over my palate. The bread basket they served was elegant and the butter very fresh and tasty. Dinner was tenderloin with lobster tail with two sides of creamed corn and bacon and the roasted mushrooms. Simple, tasty, and went well with the meat. We finished off the evening with coffee (was SO happy it was piping hot and strong) and dessert, flourless chocolate espresso cake and the coconut cream cake! Both were absolutely to die for, and a must have. Great evening."
"5.0","This is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Must try the momo and sadoko chicken! You will become addicted. The service is lacking mostly because they do not usually have enough staff. But I believe as this place becomes more popular, they will fair better in that area. Still 5 stars, in my opinion, because of the food. I have taken many friends here and everyone was always impressed."
"4.0","Great dining experience, but order the sushi NOT the ramen. The first time I checked this place out this summer we received really great customer service. We were seated at the bar on a Wednesday night because the wait for tables were an hour long (Be sure to make a reservation in advance!! This place is so popular) The vibe of this place is fantastic. I'd love to come at night sometime for drinks. We ordered a few appetizers and two bowls of the tonkatsu ramen. The ramen took over an hour to come out so we flagged down our waitress and she apologized profusely and brought us drinks and another appetizer on the house. The ramen however, once it arrived, was so so salty. I cannot emphasize how salty I found the ramen to the point I couldn't bring myself to drink the broth at the end. They are generous with the pork but be aware that it's not tonkatsu! (although still good) Just a big fat pork rib. I returned a second time for my birthday last month and ordered the chirashi bowl. The sushi tasted really fresh (loved the scallops) but honestly I was still so hungry afterwards because the bowl was so small (lol). I attempted to finish my friends ramen and then could not be I remembered how salty it was. Loved the vibe + drinks but for the price and the hype, the food honestly not so much."
"2.0","Can't comment on food since I was just in for beers.  Okay crowd, friendly bartender, okay beer selection, but it's pretty tacky, and not really in a good way.  Looks like the last time any money was put into the place was maybe 1979."
"2.0","Food was amazing, crab cake was phenomenal. We ordered the calamari, mussels, three rivers sushi entree, Maui mahi taco, mini crab cakes.Everything came out great and tasty, except the mussels, while it tasted delicious, there were multiple dead and stinky ones.A older gentleman walked around and talked to customers, and he asked how everything was and I told him. He said it would be taken off, however the manager (different person) took off 50% for the dish after we told the waiter that brought our check at full price. Now I don't care about the $7.50, but it's more about customer service. I've managed restaurants also, and I wouldn't ever refund for a dish if there was no problem and it's just the customer being difficult, but the mussels were dead and there's practically nothing inside, except for the lining of the mussel. Don't tell me you'd refund me for the dish that you made with dead mussels and then not do it. It's a matter of principle, the money is not an issue.This is the first time visiting Pittsburgh, and I heard good things about this place. Food was good, customer service, not that great. And customer service/experience is a big part of my dining experience. Waiter was good though."
"4.0","Made reservations for a group of six friends before enjoying a night out. Once seated, our waiter seemed very distracted and took a while to take out drink orders. By the time he did, we were also ready to place food orders. Having never been there before, I had a few questions about the menu. The answers provided by our waiter were short and he didn't seem to have interest in helping guide our meal decisions. He wasn't rude, but most likely just too busy to allow for more. We were seated for over three hours, which seemed to be a little long. But most importantly, the food was delicious! Tried the Brussel sprout salad special and the bolognese. Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals. Overall enjoyed my time and meal!"
"1.0","Didn't make my Lo mein spicy like I requested and didn't give us any silverware. We're in a hotel and we don't have silverware here...you practically gave us inedible food. The review is too short to be a full post so I am still typing to make it more visible so that everyone can see this!"
"2.0","Fake Indian food. Adopted for westeners's palette it deprived of spiciness and falvour you expect from genuine Indian cuisine. Presentation is nice but service is terrible. You'd better off with a generic  Indian food truck."
"4.0","The 5 best things about Rialto Pizza.1. The veggie pizza practically comes with a salad on top: fresh, crisp and plentiful.2. A seriously delicious Italian hoagie. Darn near everyone does them, but Rialto is a cut above.3. The Rialto Giant (28 inches, 49 slices) is too big to fit in my front door, but if you're having people over for a game or a party it's perfect. Tip: Use it as an incentive on moving day. You'll have more help (and more pizza) than you'll know what to do with.4. An admirable selection of decently-priced beer means not having to make two stops on the way home.5. If there's no game on t.v., guaranteed they are playing some basic cable reality show (which is the television equivalent of eating pizza)."
"2.0","I came in to grab some lunch before I went off to work. It was nice and sunny outside. Pittsburgh nice, at least (30s and sunny). Still....I looked over the menu and its short and to the point. A handful of fried seafood things, a small collection of non-seafood sandwiches, and some more various fried things. I settled on their special, which is two crabcakes plus two sides. I got the fries and the onion rings. I also orderd an 'original oyster' which is actually a gigantic hushpuppy with a very tiny oyster inside of it. I was pretty bummed out by that because the two crab cakes were really just basically hushpuppies with a few pieces of crab meat and an occasional piece of krabmeat. Definitely a bummer. The fries and the onion rings were cold. Also a bummer.Everything tasted okay, I guess. Lots of salt in the crab cakes and oyster. The onion rings, if they were fresh and hot, would have been great. They're freshly made, crunchy and you can actually bite through a piece of the onion and not yank the whole onion out.The service though...well..it sucked. The bartender ignored me the entire time I was there. I had drank through almost all of my soda before my plate arrived. And yes you yinzers, I said soda, don't act like you've never heard that one before. After I was done eating, I asked for a refill of my soda. He then disappeared for about 10 minutes, which is just long enough to finish a cigarette and cell phone conversation. Hey, I used to be a waiter, too. I know what you're doing. So after he comes back, he hands me my bill. Then he remembers I asked for a soda 15 minutes ago and finally refills my cup. This is approximately 25 minutes after my plate arrives and my cup was dry the entire time.Other than that, the place is a dive. I like dives though, so this is no thing. They have a good handful of beers, if that's your pleasure. They only had one type of wine, much to the dismay of those seated right behind me. The food's alright, would have been better if it was hot. And I'm sure if I had just kept it simple and gotten a fish sandwich or fish on a dish, it might have been a decent meal. I probably won't be going back. Its in an inconveniant location, the food is barely even par, and the service is horrible.Also..they do not accept cards. Though they do have an ATM (Mack Machine, whatever the yinzfolk call it), outside."
"2.0","We have been here twice in last couple months before Heinz Hall events.  First time (before Blue Man Group) was so slow we were up against it to make the performance on time.  Food was fine but hard to enjoy when you keep looking at your watch to see if you have enough time to finish.....no, not overly crowded but under-staffed.  'Can I have a check...NOW?'Second visit before Foxworthy and Larry the Cable guy we allowed PLENTY of time  Twelve patrons in the restaurant and four staff on the floor....32 minutes from drink order to when food served....and if we weren't concerned about time we would have sent it back as it was 10 degrees above room temperature.To get a check I approached a couple waiters who said, 'Oh they are...',   I interrupted them; 'I need a check; go find who has it; we got a show to go to.'If you appreciate slow service and luke-warm food.....this is your place."
"4.0","Excellent wings.  Just what I was looking for.  Buffalo hot sauce is right on the money. Blue cheese was great, wings skins were crispy. Great place to grab a beer, watch a game and feast on wings."
"5.0","Delicious vegan food, great service. Great ambiance. I'm not a vegan or vegetarian but I would highly recommend to anyone! It seemed family friendly also"
"5.0","Wow!  Fantastic.  I just happened to stumble upon B52 while buying a plant at a nearby shop.  I am not vegan or even vegetarian.  The very helpful employee helped me with the menu.  I ordered the Kofta Tofu Scramble for breakfast.  It was incredible.  The atmosphere was welcoming.   I can't wait to go back!"
"5.0","This place has been on my radar for some time now.  I have heard people talk of it for a long time just making my wait that much longer.  It's like when you want something, but you just can't have it and having it rubbed in your face.I like this place and the way it looks.  It's sleek, and minimal.  Nothing flashy about it, so modern like.  The day that I came here it must have been between busy hours which afforded us the chance to just walk in and sit wherever we wanted.  We chose the bar which made for quick service all around.  The menu is straightforward.  You basically pick what you want, the description is point on which leaves nothing to be questioned.  Which is probably why I had a hard time deciding exactly what I wanted.  But I did end up making a good decision.  I went with the Morningside Burger, that's another thing to love about this place, all the burgers are named after the many different neighborhoods in the city.  More of a play on words than the neighborhood, the Morningside Burger is basically what it sounds like.  Plain and simple, bacon, egg and cheese.  Add some mayo and you got yourself a pretty amazing burger.  A perfectly smashed burger, seasoned so well and when those toppings are there, it's amazing.  A tip if you do get this, go with the dippy egg.  When that yolk breaks you get a little extra added bonus.  As for the side, just go with the fries.  There are other sides you can get, but they won't be like these fries.  Pierogies, mac n cheese, rosemary fries, slaw, mixed greens salad; push them all to the side and go with the fries.  They are definitely hand cut.  No two fries are alike as they are cut literally by hand.  You may get a small fry but the next one may look like a steak fry.  Reminds me of doing something like that at home.  And who could pass up a cold one with this meal?  Not I.  I had the 1890 draft.  This thing tasted so light to me.  Smooth and easy going.  Coming from nearby Zelienople it is a house brewed beer.  One thing to also note here is that they do deliver, with a small fee."
"5.0","Everything is solid but if you have an addictive personality, stay away from the hotcakes...they are ridiculous. Don't forget-CASH ONLY!"
"5.0","One of my favorite restaurants!!About the buffet:I've only had buffet here once or twice. It is not very flavorful to me because I LOVE spicy food. But for that price you can't really expect more. Other food:I always order chicken tikka masala-- it's a MUST! It is the best tasting curry I had in Pittsburgh, or ever! It is spicy and creamy at the same time... I don't really know how to explain it but you have to try it! I always order plain naans with it. I've also tried out other curry but to me nothing taste better than chicken tikka masala. I don't like the rice at all but I guess it's caused by cultural difference rather than bad cooking. My friend has no problem with it.Service:The waiters are very polite and friendly. I rarely have to ask for more water, and when you are eating Indian curry, not having water is the last thing you want. After going there a couple of times, one of the waiters remembered me and would give me and my friend a cup of soda every time we go there. I've never had any issue with the waiters there. They have very good manners. Environment:The restaurant is very clean and well organized. I also like the Indian music they always play in the background. The restaurant is comparatively quiet.All in all, this is a really nice restaurant especially considering their price is a fraction of other Indian restaurant I've been to in Pittsburgh. I've been eating here for about 4 years and the experience had always been very enjoyable. Now that I moved to LA, I really miss this place."
"4.0","Our meal was great and the service was excellent. We visited on a Sunday for lunch, while on a visit to CMU. More authentic choices than the too typical American Chinese menus found throughout the US. Some adventurous dishes available, some Sichuan for those who like heat, noodle soup and congee choices, as well as some dishes with which most folks are familiar. Worth the visit, for sure."
"4.0","The pizza and hoagies here are absolutely amazing. I do, however, recommend picking it up as delivery can sometimes take a bit long. Understandably so, the food is great!"
"5.0","There were so few vegetarian joints but lately they have been showing up on the grid.  I remember being a vegetarian for years and felt as if there were barely any options out there..but after finding out about this place this had completely changed my thoughts! The pork bun dish was sweet and tangy, I forgot that I wasn't eating any meat!  Not only do they have tasty treats, small bites, and delicious dishes but the ambience is super sweet.  It's got a rocker vibe to it and lots of artwork.  The scene is very cool.  The people are even better! Definitely try out this upcoming restaurant !"
"5.0","Amazing Food! Very popular place, even during weekday evening. Call early for reservation!"
"1.0","This is easily the worst pizza I have ever eaten in my life.  I ordered 2 slices.  Rialto 'heated' them (read: practically burnt to a crisp) so much that the cheese hardened to the point that it literally chipped off when I attempted to eat it.  How does cheese that is supposed to be melted manage to chip off?  The crust was so dry and crunchy, I'm surprised I didn't lacerate my throat trying to eat it.  Not to mention that the cost of 2 slices was more expensive than an entire 4-cut personal pizza.  Will NEVER go there again."
"5.0","Super yummy vegan food! Such a cute little place! The staff is also great and friendly! Highly recommend!!!"
"2.0","Stopped in with Classy Mike and Pittsburgh's own Mr. Matt-boto during Mike and I's road trip from New York to Los Angeles.I could have given Pamela's three stars but I gotta be honest with y'all...Pamela's needs a shot in the ass to find that fire again.  Yes, I  understand that being endorsed by the friggin President gives you some mighty laurels to rest upon.  But Pamela's, y'all ain't tryin'.The pancakes are good.  Maybe even really good - probably 19 stars on my patented 25 star rating system.  But Pamela's just doesn't give a damn about anything else.  Aerosol whipped cream, Minute Maid sold in a tiny glass at a huge markup, and frozen fruit that's been sitting out for who knows how long.  C'mon guys, the endorsement of the President is something to live up to - not an excuse to cut corners.Food: 18/25 starsAmbiance: 13/25 starsService: 20/25 starsBathroom: 17/25 stars (you have to go upstairs to a separate shop)Probability of going back: 20%"
"1.0","Ok, this is going to be a very mixed review; I'm going to split it in two sections and explain my poor rating. I legitimately feel bad about giving one star, but, I hope all that read understand why.  I seek to write honest and forthright reviews based on my personal experiences without outside influence.  On that note, I'm sorry to write this review. I arrived with a party of six on 'take your kid to work day' in the 'Burgh.Here we go:The Good: the food is pretty decent fair, but it does not warrant the prices.  But, that's ok, it's only a few bucks more than everyone else and offers a superior environment. The wait for food was exceptionally long, but, the restaurant solidly acknowledged that and discounted our food without request. I have to give them a lot of credit, it was incredibly kind and considerate of them to take care of us in such a manner. Kudos to their waitstaff and management.  Rarely will an establishment adjust a tab, without request, for the sole purpose of keeping patrons happy so they come back again. Very cool!The Bad: When ordering, I explicitly stated that my six-year old son could not have cheese on his kid-burger as it would immediately be sent back. Well, it showed up with cheese. I get that, it happens. I used to serve tables too. It was sent back. When we received it back a few minutes later we realized that they had taken the burgers back and hand-scraped the cheese off of them.  Particles of cheese were duly noted by my kid and I. You can't do that. You cannot do that EVER. RESPECT DIETARY REQUESTS; FAILURE TO DO SO CAN HURT PEOPLEFood Safety Fail = 1 Star Rating"
"5.0","I always hear so and so has the best tacos or you have to try their tacos... let me just say this no thanks.... EDGARS FOR THE WIN!!!!! Hands down THE BEST tacos in Pittsburgh. When you are within a 2 block radius of Edgars and you smell something drawing you in and you say to yourself 'What is that amazing smell?!?' It's Edgars, I can assure you! Edgar has a little stand next to Pamelas diner in the strip. The taco selection here is amazing. He always has specials which are highly recommended. I always get tacos, it doesn't matter what type, but make sure you get tacos! Once they grace your lips you will understand why Edgars is rated 5 stars across the board on yelp! I also recommend getting a horchada drink as well, best I've ever had. If you have ever had horchada you know how delicious it is, if you've never had horchada then Edgars is the best place for your first ever experience. I am literally licking my lips drooling and my stomach is rumbling just from writing this review thinking about Edgars tacos even though I just ate. I will be heading there first thing in the AM! PLEASE do yourself a favor and put Edgars on your list of must have tacos in Pittsburgh!"
"5.0","Very nice place. Decor is beautiful and they have a loft with a large table where you can play games with your friends. Staff was very nice!!! We only stopped in for drinks after dinner somewhere else. Husband loved the beer! I had a cider that wasn't made in house. People next to us at the bar ordered food and it looked excellent. They commented on how good it was. Menu looked very interesting and I will be back to try it.  I'm super excited to try the brunch because it sounds soooo good! Great addition to Lawrenceville!"
"5.0","I had a fantastic experience at Morcilla. I met a couple of friends for dinner here on Friday night, as I was moving out of Pittsburgh the next day and wanted to eat somewhere special for my last meal in the 'burgh. Given all of the great things I had been hearing about Morcilla, I made a reservation--and it did not disappoint!The menu is broken down into a few categories depending on the type and size of the dish. Some items consist of just a few bites, then there are some larger plates, and even a few platters meant to be shared by the table. My friends and I took the approach of ordering a bunch of items and sharing/tasting them all. We were a little unsure of how much to order, but our waitress was very helpful and knowledgeable.A few favorites were the beef tartare (on crusty, thin bread with cured egg yolk and vegetable escabeche--basically pickled veggies), the salt cod with crispy capers, fried garlic chips, and lemon, and also the lamb meatballs with with raisins, sumac, and leek. The tartare was possibly the best I've ever had, and was absolutely packed with flavor. The lamb meatballs were juicy and also full of flavor, and the sumac yogurt was a fantastic pairing. I also enjoyed the chorizo with crispy potato and brandied prune. The thick prune sauce was unique and a flavor combination that really stood out to me. While some items definitely stood out, everything was enjoyable and I loved the ability to experience so many different ingredients, textures, and flavors in one meal.The service was also great. Dishes were brought out with timing in mind, so at no point were there more than two or three items on the table. Each dish was also explained as it arrived, which was also helpful since it's easy to forget exactly what was ordered when it comes to small plates.It's also reasonably priced, especially given the quality--for ten menu items and three cocktails, our total bill (for three people) came to just under $100. Overall I really enjoyed this meal and would love to return whenever I'm in Pittsburgh visiting."
"4.0","Went for lunch with my niece and her husband.  Just as we were served water and bread(delicious)  he was called back to work.  Service was excellent and they prepared his steak at the exact time for us to take it back to him at work. He said it was delicious.  I had crab cakes and expected them to be better but shouldn't I have just ordered a steak?  I also ordered a Pinot Grigio,( Margherita)which I know cost 18 dollars a bottle for which they charged $17/glass.  All the same, it was an enjoyable experience and except for the wine I felt that the the prices were very reasonable.  I would just be more careful about what I order.  It really is a lovely place"
"4.0","Neat little cafe--good sandwiches, friendly owners, and lots of desserts. The Da Vinci sandwich was an inexpensive and quite filling lunch option and paired well with a strawberry lemonade. Will go for the ice cream next time as per their name!"
"5.0","As a fanatic of Justin Severino's other Pittsburgh restaurant, Cure, I knew I was in for a treat when visiting Morcilla. What I didn't expect was for it to pass Cure as my favorite spot in Pittsburgh. My dinner experience could not have been better. Morcilla is a Spanish, tapas restaurant with an emphasis on cured meats. The chef is renown in the US for his curing ability and it shows in every dish. The space itself is unique but fits the food. You almost feel that you are in the family dining room in a Spanish Villa.Like Cure, the bar staff are exceptional the drinks are phenomenal. I did not have a bad drink and tried four throughout the night. If you'd like something off menu let them know what flavors you appreciate in a cocktail and they will do their best to make a unique drink for you. I ordered the Family Feast with my girlfriend. At only $45 per person for a full four course meal, it is the best prix fixe experience in Pittsburgh. Not only is it four courses, but there are a large number of plates per course. All in all we shared all of the following: MANZANILLA OLIVES - citrus, rosemary, olive oil, MARCONA ALMONDS - lavender sugar, sea salt, extra virgin olive oil, WARM BREAD - olive oil, MORCILLA ACHORIZADA - pork salami, pigs blood, piquillo pepper conserva, PIMENTONE CHEESE MONTADITO - mahon, idiazabal, manchego, queso de cabra, fermented iberian chili, piquillo peppers, cucumber, dill, OCTOPUS A LA PLANCHA - sesame yogurt, cucumbers, crispy pickled chickpeas, merguez spice, CHAMPINONES A LA PLANCHA - oyster mushrooms, egg yolk, shallot, bread, ARROZ CON PITU DE CALEYA - cider braised chicken, calasparra rice, herbs, BRANDADE DE BACALAO MONTADITO - salt cod, caramelized crab, lemon oil, CHURROS with chocolate hazelnut fondue.We could barely finish 2/3 of what the brought us and had to take home some leftovers. After trying every dish it was almost impossible to pick favorites. The first course offers the most dishes and largest variety of flavors. The cured meats were salty and full of spices that complimented the meat perfectly. The lavender almonds were also divine.The small and large plates were absolute perfection. The meatiness of the octopus was cut perfectly by the yogurt sauce, the Championes A La Plancha blew me away. I didn't expect that amount of savory flavor to come from a seemingly simple dish, but it was one in the top of the night for me. The chicken was another dish that seemed simple but is accompanied by a rich variety of flavor that elevates it beyond normal chicken dishes. I cannot wait to go back, the food is unique in Pittsburgh and could not be more perfectly executed. TLDR: Order drinks, order the prix fixe ('family style') and gorge on delicious savory, salty flavors in unique dishes that you haven't experienced before. Enjoy some of the finest dinners Pittsburgh has to offer."
"1.0","The butterfly shrimp are the best on the menu, and with that said..... Everyone is nice except for the hag'd out older server. If you have a problem here don't expect them to fix it...instead u will be treated like shit. And if you are black, dont come at night unless u want to hear the N word pouring from the kitchen all night. And the crab cakes are imitation.....award winning my asshole."
"4.0","Great crepe and omelette. French toast was not decent but I won't be ordering it again. I'll definitely be back to try more crepes though! Tons of options and very good portions. It was a little warm inside though."
"5.0","This is definitely one of the best places to eat in Pittsburgh! Went here for lunch with my husband and we loved everything! Pretty great service as well!"
"4.0","This is a fancy place for special occasions. It's clearly an expensive restaurant, but the quality of food and service matches the price. The filet mignon was perfect; I savored every bite. And for dessert, the flourless chocolate espresso cake was rich, but not overly sweet. I wouldn't go here often, but if I did end up here, I know it would be a wonderful experience."
"3.0","I really want to like this place because they have a great location and a sweet TV set up and a great open concept but every time I go I'm always disappointed. The service is consistently below satisfactory and the quality of the food never matches how much my bill is at the end of the meal. My friends and I know better than to just put one drink order in at a time because if you only order one you won't see your waitress/waiter for awhile."
"4.0","Came here for dinner on a Sunday around 7pm. It was packed!!! It was quick to order and we were able to find a table. They give you a buzzer and you set it on a locator on your table. I thought that was neat. I ordered the chicken salad (no heat) and a side of fresh fruit. My husband ordered the chicken and waffles (also no heat). My salad was huge and really good. The chicken was not chewy at all. My husband said his was good but not enough chicken for the portion of waffle. I would definitely come back and try another item. I liked that the menu was limited. It's stressful when there are too many items to choose from."

"4.0","It was that time of day where you wanted lunch and a coffee. Well, I wanted lunch and a coffee. I'm a frequent flyer of Starbucks since it's close to my house, but I'm also a huge fan of local businesses. I've never been here and the first time I passed it I assumed it was an ice cream place. The parking situation kind of sucks because it's along that main strip where there's construction and turning lanes. All you really have right there is curbside parking that's usually quick to fill up. I found a spot though!Upon entering I noticed it was bigger than I imagined and the space was inviting/clean. There were tall round tables to the right and near the window there were two to three spacious tables situated. They have a lot going on in terms of menu items. There was breakfast with extremely friendly prices, sandwiches, coffee, muffins, buckeyes (I got three and they were huge and delicious!), lemon bars, cupcakes. They of course have ice cream as well, but I didn't see or sample any this time. There were two friendly ladies helping two of us out.I grabbed a bottle of water, got a tall vanilla latte, and a Milano sandwich. The total for all three was $11. I really enjoyed the sandwich and my vanilla latte. The combination of flavors was just right and the sandwich itself was a good size cut in half. I'd love to try their ice cream. There were only two things I wasn't a fan of: When you walk in there is a noise to let people know someone walked through the door. It wasn't like a ding...a bit lengthy and annoying. Another sore spot was the steamer whenever someone ordered a latte due to how obnoxiously loud it was. Maybe it appeared loud because it was quiet or something with the space being smaller, but I don't recall ever hearing anything so loud when coffee is being made. Just my take though and not something that would take away from the great spot."
"5.0","This was seriously the best Japanese food I have ever had. Everything was so fresh and delicious. Moreover, the service was just perfect. She came by just enough to make sure we were OK, but not enough to not disturb our meal. She was very sweet.I love you the homemade ginger salad dressing. The tuna roll, chicken yakitori and dumplings were delicious. Definitely returning here when I come back to Pittsburgh."
"5.0","This was my first time eating Nepali food and it was such a great experience. They had great vegetarian options, very large portions, for very affordable prices. I had the vegetarian Nepali platter, it was filling and delicious. Our service was also excellent. Highly recommend."
"3.0","Ok so I've eaten here several times. And the food and service have been decent. When I came in on a Wednesday am at 9:30 with some friends for breakfast I didn't think it would take an hour and a half to get in and out. The latte was delicious. The food decent. I shared the eggplant Benedict and avocado omelette. It was a nice size portion for both. But the service was super slow. We were convinced the server was also the cook. There were only a few other tables in the restaurant as well. And the window literally fell in behind the cash register! Thankfully the server wasn't there at the time!"

"3.0","Buca di Beppo Restaurant in station square is pretty good. I've been there 3 times now and I think it's gotten better each time I've gone there. First off, the place is cute and very Italian looking and decorated lol. There's a lot of seating and every time I've gone, I don't believe we had to wait. We've gone for my birthday about three years ago and I think that was the best experience. We had one of the rooms upstairs to ourselves. The food is served family style so whatever you order, it gets shared. It can get a little pricey. Overall, I'd recommend it!"
"5.0","This is my favorite of the high end steakhouse chains in Pittsburgh. Drinks are always great and the bartender is always friendly. Steak is always on point and side come out perfect as well."
"5.0","I've been here a few times and all I have to say is how amazing it is. Highly recommend the veggie dogs. The menu prices are super affordable. Also so one loves to bake because the cheesecake of the week is always worth the try. The ramen is also a favorite, oddly it is colored purple. The curry is strange and a tad extra spicy but definitely delicious. The neighborhood isn't the greatest and the restaurant is tiny but the service is always incredibly nice. They even have apparel for the heavy metal vegan lifestyle and a heavy metal record store next door. 100% recommend for vegans, vegetarians, pescatarians and meat eaters alike. PS Get the sautéed kale. It's amazing"
"1.0","Even a 1-star rating is an overstatement given the fact that I threw up (literally, not metaphorically) after eating at Umami...My bf and I went there on Saturday night. We ordered Takoyaki (octopus balls) to start with, which was pretty delicious. We then had a special roll with spicy tuna and eel, which was decent (albeit overpriced at $18), and a number of robatayaki (pork belly, chicken thigh, shrimp, chicken heart, mushroom, and eggplant). The 'highlight' of the night (which we sincerely thought would be the highlight) was a grilled whole fish (red snapper). It came out slightly burned and just wasn't that delicious. We didn't finish the entire dish since neither of us liked that dish much, and both of us started feeling nauseous immediately after eating it and especially after we left the restaurant. After I got home 20 minutes later, I literally threw up... My bf didn't throw up but he had to rest for 2 hours before he started to feel normal again. We have no idea what could have caused the sickness; we both eat a lot of seafood on regular basis, raw or cooked. I also have a pretty strong stomach and the last time I threw up was years ago when I had food poisoning... Maybe this is a coincidence (I do hope that is the case), but we would NOT return to the restaurant again..."
"2.0","I really wanted to like this place but I was disappointed. The cucumber salads with sour cream was the best item I had. My Puszta Steak was surprisingly tasteless. It felt like a grease bomb. The Smashed potatoes were much better than the tasteless dumplings. The ambiance is dingy bar. Unlikely to return. The menu looks good but the taste is uneven."
"5.0","Maybe I am starting most of my reviews as ' it was my first time' Yes for that place it was my first time. I never been in Pittsburg before and My significant other and I were watching the youtube videos about thing to do in Pittsburgh and we saw that place and added my bookmarks right away. I can't describe how much I love desserts and couldn't imagine without that. I am located in New York and I never been any bakery like that. if is there any option I would like to give 10 stars for La Gourmandine Bakery.The Decoration of the bakery was nice and it was so clean in there.I had vanilla cream chocolate chip croissant which is so delicious and fluffy. They have so many Because of that I couldn't wait to go back there again. Comparing the pricing New York, I am so surprised and we paid $9.90 for two Croissants, black tea and I iced coffee. I highly recommend that bakeshop. Can't wait to go back there Thank you"
"5.0","We have come here a number of times for weekend breakfast and had a fantastic experience every time. This is one of our favorite breakfast sandwiches in the city and they also have amazing vegan/vegetarian options. The staff is also wonderful!"
"5.0","One of the better Indian restaurants in the Pittsburgh area. My experience at Tamarind was great. All of the food was very fresh and flavorful. The restaurant is nestled in a cute house in Oakland and the inside has pretty decor. Our server was friendly and gave us many recommendations for what to try. For appetizers, my dad and I split the ethnic sampler which comes with fried hot chili peppers, samosas, and vegetable pakora. We also got the lentil patties. The fried hot chili peppers were amazing, because they had a tiny bit of heat to them! The samosas were flaky and crispy, and they weren't dry. The lentil patties were served with various sauces that each had a unique flavor to them. For the main course, I had the lamb vindaloo which was so yummy. The vindaloo sauce was almost like a thick tomato sauce with some spice to it. It was a generous portion that came with vegetable daal and basmati rice. Also, the entree came with garlic naan, which definitely hit the spot. The naan was soft and chewy and had the perfect amount of garlic. I want to come back to Tamarind, because everything was outstanding and satisfied my Indian food craving :) I would highly recommend."
"1.0","Called to see about making a reservation and whether or not they talk walk ins. The guy who answered the phone told me I could 'come to the door' and then hung up on me.Guess they were busy, but that turned me off from wanting to try the restaurant."
"4.0","My husband and I tried out Sausalido as we were searching for a rehearsal dinner spot, and it was solid. Not a terribly interesting menu, but the owner and service were friendly, the food seemed predictably good, and the value was good as well. On the other hand, the interior is slightly dated and our window table in the window was so cold that I had to keep my jacket on.We started our meal with the roasted sprouts - which didn't really taste roasted (outsides weren't caramelized) - but were covered in cheese, so were still pretty good. We had the pork and the steak for our entrees, and while they weren't notably amazing, they were cooked and seasoned well...and the portions were enormous. I'm not sure if we would make Sausalido a destination, but I would eat here again if I'm in the neighborhood and want a nicer meal."
"4.0","SETTINGClean interior with tables positioned close together in a tight space. Loud chatter and background noise during a Sunday brunch.FOODUnique and tasty brunch offerings, which is the main reason I like this spot. Pancakes and waffles are delicious and all, but occasionally my taste buds crave something more exotic. Coca Cafe does the job right. I've always gotten the Fried Eggplant Benedict. If this is your first time here, get this now and thank me later. Not a huge fan of eggplant? Don't worry, it doesn't have an overwhelming taste. Two servings of fried eggplant and poached eggs on top of its own english muffin, topped with roasted tomatoes and doused in--wait for it--BASIL hollandaise sauce. Tasted a bit like pesto mixed in with hollandaise sauce, and let me tell you, it was heavenly.This time I ventured out and tried a new dish. The Smoked salmon omelet was solid, but it felt like something was missing...maybe some sort of sauce would have taken it to a new level. Along with bits of salmon, the omelet also had a generous amount of goat cheese, a bit of dill, and a few sliced baby tomatoes inside. I'm pretty sure it was a typo on the menu because instead of 'smoked' salmon, it was 'cooked' salmon. Still good, but it wasn't what was advertised. If it had some sort of sauce to add to the texture and provide a sort of moistness, I think it could become a very good dish. For now, I'll stick with the Eggplant Benedict.SERVICEI've never waited so long (on premise) for food before. Put our phone number down and was told 1 hour 15 min. After waiting the full length of time, we went back to check on our status. Apparently they wrote down the wrong phone number or something since they claimed they called but we never got it. After finally being seated, it took another 20 or so minutes to get our food. Total time we waited from putting down our name to food on table was 2 hours!!! NOT COOL. The atmosphere seemed kinda of hectic. Lots of movement, loud chatter from other nearby tables, and long waits. This is probably the main reason I don't come that much, but if I do, I go right when they open. IMPRESSIONSAt first thought, 'adventurous' and 'comfort food' don't seem to go together, but neither do Leonardo DiCaprio and Rihanna. I was wrong, on both counts!  You know a certain dish like the Fried Eggplant Benedict is special when you only associate it with the one restaurant, and you can't seem to muster the courage to order something else every time you visit. Just make sure you come early. Or you might be waiting 2 hours :("
"5.0","Amazing food. We got all of the mains and shared them as a group. Incredible salted cod dish, tender baked octopus. Spotless restaurant with impeccable service. Definitely a must-try restaurant!"
"5.0","This place is the bomb diggity. My roommate and I come here whenever we are in the mood for good food. Everyone is always so friendly! We especially come here for the kadak chai!"
"3.0","My wife and I came here on a freezing cold late Saturday afternoon.  We found street parking and rushed to get inside.  It wasn't too busy when we first got here.  We were greeted by the hostess and sat right down at a two seater. We had looked over the menu a little bit before we came here so we sort of knew what we wanted.  Our waitress was nice and she came over to ask us if we had ever been here before and if we would like her to explain the menu.  We let her and she did a good job explaining everything to us. We ordered their Meat Bao bun that had Oyster in it to start us off.  For our main dish I ordered the Shoyu Ramen and my wife got the Inferno Ramen. Our Bao came out within 10 minutes.  It looked good. Our waitress said that if we were sharing it they would cut it in half for us but they didn't but  no big deal we cut it and shared the bun.  The actually bun was good but we felt that it needed more filling.  It was a lot more bun and less Oyster.  It was good but we have tasted better. Our Ramen came out about ten minutes later.  Our dishes looked really good and we were hungry.  My wife liked her dish and you can read her review on her Ramen.  My Ramen was good but not great.  The noodles were really good.  The broth warmed us up and was good but I felt it needed a little more salt or something to bring out more the flavors in my Ramen.  I'd give it a six out of ten.  I like the vegetable in my Ramen but the chicken looked a little funny to me and tasted funny too.  The Ramen filled me up and I was satisfied.  Not the best Ramen and maybe a little over priced but if your in the area and it's cold out this is a good spot to try out."
"1.0","Was busy when we got there. We waited for over an hour and a half after we ordered our food. When we decided that we had had enough and cancelled our order, they exclaimed that the food was ready. Pressed for time and not wanting to be rude, we said we would take it away. They then proceeded to make us pack it ourselves (which would be fine if it wasn't for the fact that the food was served in still hot cast iron skillets and we had no cutlery). When we got home - we realized they served us 1) Overcooked meats (fine)2) Severely undercooked eggs (poor form especially since this purports to be a brunch place) 3) Raw sausage (OH.GOD.ITS.SO.RAW) Disappointed to say the least. Will return when I feel the urge to punish myself."
"5.0","From beginning to end this meal was fantastic. Atmosphere of this restaurant was fancy, but casual at the same time. Wait staff were very friendly, had great knowledge of the menu and worked their tails off to make sure my table and the tables around us were taken care of. My date and I had sushi, the mahi mahi tacos and the Baja shrimp and day-boat scallop dish. Our food was phenomenal. That's all I'll say about our food. My date and I are looking forward to going back soon. Great experience!"
"4.0","Pricey but really good dogs & fries, and about a bazillion kinds of beer. On street parking or a pay lot across the street only."
"5.0","V3 has great atmosphere. It's fast, hot and delicious! BYOB overall a great pizza joint. The flatbreads are fantastic."
"2.0","I came in with high expectations and was disappointed. Both myself and my wife didn't like our meals. The place is cool inside and I did have a good old fashioned with dinner but the food was disappointing. It also seemed somewhat overpriced to us."
"5.0","The Capital Grille NEVER disappoints! From Vegas to Pittsburgh- Exceptional service specially on such a busy night! From right when we walked to the minute we left! Always perfectly prepared food, lovey atmosphere, staff was on point, Our server Horcho was so professional and knowledgeable I can't say enough! Thank you so much for making our Christmas Eve dining experience unforgettable, always one of our favorite places to dine. (If not my number one favorite) Capital Grille you've done it again! Bravo!"
"5.0","Located on the second floor above Emporio the meatball joint, it could be considered a step up in more ways than one. We were here for restaurant week, and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the restaurant week menu features the same dishes as the regular menu. Same size, just a few less options. For RW you get an appetizer, main and dessert for a set price. I think it was $35pp. The popular choices were Lobster pappardelle pasta for a starter and either the bone-out pork chop or shrimp fra Diablo for the main. I went with the pasta for both, which was only a minor mistake only because I couldn't finish it all. Both were generous servings. Honestly I could have stopped after the appetizer and left full, especially because we added the charcuterie board before ordering. The Lobster pasta was fantastic. I couldn't believe how much Lobster was in there! The pasta was phenomenal. Onto the main, the pasta was like a shell shape in a red sauce and the shrimp was plentiful. Dessert was a scoop of vanilla ice cream with peaches in a crepe. Very nice. I would definitely recommend this place and will return!"
"2.0","I want to like this place. Sitting outside near the river, the potential for the smell of flowers, great drinks, decent food, friendly staff, but they throw it all away to cater to smokers. So at some point or constantly, depending on who's nearby, you'll smell cigarette smoke while you eat, drink, and 'enjoy' the outdoors. I get that it's outside, but skunks are outside, teargas is outside...in other words, it doesn't matter if it's outside. Go non-smoking and cater to the 95% of people who enjoy the outdoors without smoke. You'll gain customers and only lose those who aren't willing to walk 30 feet to leave the restaurant grounds."
"4.0","Love the Wednesday night trivia, which starts at 9 each week! Tap selection is decent but doesn't change much week-to-week. Atmosphere is warm and service is always spot-on.  I only ordered food here once, and it came out cold, but I still give this place 4 stars, as the server that night noted our barely touched food and offered to get us something else or comp it."
"4.0","I have never had anything I didn't really really love, this is by far my favorite Vietnamese restaurant. It isn't a magic trick, it is good honest food."
"3.0","Fun experience. I ordered the Chicken Thali and my friend had the vegetable cheese dish. We shared the pan fried vegetable momos.  Momos were tasty, the sauce had a spicy peanut type base. It had more of an Asian flair with heat. It was neat to try the different flavors of the Thali dish. The rice was central to the platter with savory and sweet items filling the serving dishes in the periphery. I had no idea what each item was as the waiter did not explain but it was an adventure in testing each one and taking a guess.  The masala tea and mango lassi were also decent.  Service was really slow as there were only two people working in the restaurant doing everything. Worth a try. It was neat to see how they changed what was an after hours club to a restaurant."
"4.0","For a quick lunch this place is a great spot.  You get in and get what you want and go.  Especially if you hit it at just the right time.  I was surprised that it wasn't busy when we showed up, but that just made for filling my belly a quicker time.I know that the name says corned beef in it, but I have to admit that I didn't partake in a sandwich that had corned beef.  I cannot tell you why, but every single time I end up in a deli type of place I get myself an egg salad sandwich.  There's something about that sandwich that is simple.  Also something about it makes it quite the quick meal to down in a hurry.The sandwich was plentiful, I was not upset by that fact.  Two long slices of bread filled with egg salad and my choice of toppings.  I just went with lettuce as I wanted a little bit of a crunch.  I enjoyed every single bite of that sandwich.  Definitely a place I will stop in again."
"5.0","My boyfriend and I came to the Capital Grille for restaurant week and it was FABULOUS. For $35.18 a person you got a choice of a soup or salad, for the second course steak, salmon or chicken, and then two desserts to choose from. I got the field green salad with parmesan vinaigrette, an 8oz filet mignon medium rare, and flourless chocolate espresso cake for dessert along with a cup of coffee ($4 extra).Let's just start by saying the parmesan vinaigrette was AMAZING, and the salad to dressing ratio was perfect. The vegetables and lettuce were fresh and crunchy as well.My steak was cooked perfectly, and had a delicious 'crust' on the bottom that had a delicious seasoning. The sides we were given were mashed potatoes and green beans with heirloom tomatoes. Both were delicious and my boyfriend and I finished both between the two of us. Finally, dessert. This was insane. The flourless chocolate espresso cake was extremely rich and decedent, and literally melted in your mouth. It was a smaller piece of 'cake' but with how rich it was, it was the perfect size. All in all, this was one of the best meals I have ever had, and the service was amazing, especially for a night as busy as restaurant week. Would recommend to anyone!!"
"4.0","First of all, despite the fact that Rialto has indoor seating, it's not exactly the type of place that you'd want to hang out in.  They have TVs that are usually tuned to sports, but they're more for the staff than for you.  Rialto is the type of place you order your food for delivery or you go and pick it up.That being said, they have some of the best and most creative pizza in Pittsburgh.  Their steak and fries pizza is always one that we get when we have friends in from out of town.  The Giant, while being a little more costly per square inch -- yes we did the math on this -- is always impressive when you bring it home to a group of ravenous friends.  The pizza is well done, not overly greasy, and generally a good price.  If you're someone who lives in Greenfield or Squirrel Hill you owe it to yourself to check them out (actually, if you're in Greenfield, they're the best pizza in the neighborhood)."
"3.0","I personally like the food here. The meat seems higher quality than Orient Express, and nothing is too greasy or salty. That said, Little Asia's not without its flaws. First, the price. It's Pittsburgh and I'm not trynna drop $12 on dinner most nights. Service is slow and not particularly friendly. They won't adjust orders or meet special requests in my experience. The portions are also extremely meat heavy, as in, 50% meat 50% rice. I really wish they would throw some vegetables in there to mix it up.But despite these gripes I keep coming back. It's a good location and one of the only 'hot food' spots for a quick dinner on Craig. Love to hate it."
"5.0","I placed a to go order for Tom Yum soup and Pineapple Curry with chicken. It was ready in less than 5 minutes and the portions were huge! The soup was perfect and the cilantro was really fresh. The Pineapple Curry was a delicious blend of spicy (I did 7 out of 10) and sweet from the pineapple. I highly recommend this family owned authentic Thai restaurant on Liberty Ave in Bloomfield."
"4.0","This place is one of my favorites for delivery! Their pizza crust has a great flavor and is cooked perfectly. The pizza has yet to be greasy at all. I also like their salads alot. I was worried their garden salad was going to be a container of iceberg lettuce as you often get at pizza places, but it actually had vegetables on it and was green lettuce, not iceberg! The only reason I give them 4 stars and not 5, is there are limited choices and when ordering a salad you do not get a choice of dressing, although the dressing that came was great! I highly recommend this place for great delivery!"
"3.0","I was super excited to try out this new spot in Bloomfield - It looks cute inside and also has a couple outdoor tables. But - I don't think I would go back. It is a Portuguese restaurant, however, the food really just tasted American to me.. It just wasn't 'different enough' as lame as that sounds. Maybe it's what we ordered, but it was a let down."
"5.0","The first time I walked in Hello Bistro I was so overwhelmed by the salad options that I ordered a turkey burger (Which was great by the way).  Ever since that first visit,  they've been consistent with the quality and customer service. The ingredients are great and every time is just as great as the first time. My only complaint is that the salad portion size is ridiculous. I don't go unless I feel I can consume such a huge amount of salad."
"4.0","So flavorful and delicious. The waiters were well versed in the entrees and drinks. Perfect tapas, a little pricey but amazing flavor and ingredients. Had a great time. Not sure how often I'd go again"
"3.0","Hard to believe this Eat N Park has never been reviewed being one of the oldest in the history of the franchise. Eat N Park is a local franchise, the corporate headquarters are located at the Waterfront in Homestead. A Family restaurant, the menu is extensive, appetizers to salads, burgers to sundaes. It's all here. Who hasn't come here on the weekend to gorge themselves on the midnight buffet? Admit it, we've all imbibed a bit too much and needed something to make the morning hangover less painful. The grilled bearclaw is a Pittsburgh favorite, sweet pasty dough, cinnamon gooey icing, grilled in butter, served hot from the griddle, with coffee or a large glass of milk, this has been my choice meal after many nights of extreme alcohol consumption. The Super Burger is their version of the Big Mac. Only made better because it comes served on a dish and not in a cardboard box. With fries, this was a favorite meal when I was growing up. Breakfast is where Eat N Park shines, they make some awesome blueberry pancakes. Light and fluffy, stuffed with tons of blueberries and warm syrup, this is one of my favorites. Who can resist a smiley cookie? An awesome sugar cookie with glazed icing, they come in a variety of colors and even Pittsburgh sports team colors when it's playoff time. The famous strawberry pie is another favorite of Pittsburgers. Everyone looks forward to the very berry month of May. Eat N Park isn't for everyone, but when you crave a bit of the past or need a meal 24 hours a day, Eat N Park will be there."
"1.0","If I could give this place 0 stars believe me I would. My family and I decided to come here to grab food before a Pirates game this past weekend. We were thoroughly disappointed. We got seated right away, we had a party of six. A waiter, who never even introduced himself, came up and said that their dishwasher had broken and they needed to wait for glasses. After 15 minutes he brought out 4 waters, all in plastic cups, and didn't even realize he forgot two. Right then and there we placed our order for 3 alcoholic beverages, 2 sodas, an appetizer, and 6 meals. 10 minutes after placing our order the waiter told us 2 of our drinks were unavailable, it took 15 for him to bring out all of the drinks. After this we did not see him until 45-50 minutes out when he asked if everything was okay. We had no appetizer, everyone's drinks were empty, and we still didn't even have silverware. He went into the kitchen and made up our appetizer himself, chips and queso, frankly it tasted as if he didn't even heat it up because it was hard and cold. We eventually got our food 10 minutes after this and it came out cold. Don't make people wait almost an hour for cold food. Definitely a mistake choosing to eat here and I definitely won't be doing it again"
"4.0","I live so close that I recently decided to try for breakfast and I really liked it. It is nothing fancy and is pretty cozy as opposed to all of the other places on Walnut. This was fine with me as I like a simple diner style breakfast. They always have soccer on in the mornings/afternoons on Saturday, so that's pretty cool if you're a fan and can't find a place to watch. Their breakfasts were simple but good - I always get eggs, toast, and home fries. I was surprised to see they had shredded hash browns as their home fries which are my favorite and hard to find! Our waitress has been the same every time we visited and she's very nice and attentive. Overall, cheap no frills spot (you even have to butter your own toast, lol! Not complaining though) with good food and service."
"4.0","HAPPY HOUR for the WIN! Best happy hour around. $6 strong, crafted, creative drinks. Discounted prices for food. Board games. Garage Doors. Fun atmosphere. You can't go wrong with The Summit during their 5-7PM M-F happy hour!"
"5.0","five star review for the restaurant, one star for the reviewers. I have no idea why the reviews for this restaurant are so low!I just wanna point out that one of the bad reviews is, like, someone who ordered UberEats on Thanksgiving and was upset the food order was slow/slightly wrong lol.................. I'm sorry, but who does that?? And to clarify on the 15% gratuity, the owner isn't trying to scam you or anything... I actually missed that the first time I came here and tipped on top of that, and the waitress brought my check back to my table so I could correct it. If you are mad because you wanted to leave less than 15% you are evil lol grow up.The food is good and the inside of the restaurant is nice because I'm a sucker for high ceilings. The service is fine-- it's not like five star hotelier restaurant service, but I don't need the waitress to smile at me to know that she is cool with me, and you are a baby if you do. The lunch special pork belly over rice is soooo good and a really decent price. It comes with seaweed, some fish and also an egg. The mapo tofu is pretty good too. The sweet mango sago dessert soup is nice, but I personally like the one at Love Ramen (nearby in South O) the best."
"1.0","Il Tetto is a great spot for drinks with a beautiful view of the city, however the logistics and drink service leave much to be desired. Getting up to Il Tetto is an awkward elevator ride up (after waiting in the queue downstairs depending on how crowded it is) ... and the same awkward elevator ride to get back down. The service has never been great, but my most recent visit was by far the worst experience. The bartenders were flat out rude and seemed inconvenienced to even take notice of us as we sat at the bar. One of the bartenders aggressively grabbed the (filthy) menu from under my friend's arm as soon as we gave our order.  The entire staff was so wrapped up in themselves and their own conversations that they barely took notice of the customers. Safe to say I will not be returning to this establishment anytime soon."
"4.0","Love the food here. Wasn't real sure about the 'healthy' menu, but have been quite surprised. No, it's not a fancy place --- it's a cafe, not a full restaurant. Have tried a variety of soups, and sandwiches, been pleased with everything.(how is it possible to make a vegan Reuben that tasted better than the real thing?)"
"4.0","This place is so tiny you might never notice it tucked into a tiny storefront on Liberty. But sometimes those hidden spots are hidden gems, and this is seriously one of those places.I worried when I tried to call in our order and got a message that the mailbox was not in service. After double and triple checking the number, I actually thought the place must have gone out of business, except there were reviews from just a week or two ago. I decided to walk over and check it out, and am glad I did. The place was pretty busy for a random Sunday evening, but the take out was made quickly, and was some of the best Thai food I've had in Pittsburgh. The peanut sauce with the summer rolls was everything I wanted it to be, my partner's prik noodles were awesome, and my red curry was fiery and delicious. This place will take your heat requests seriously - order a ten at your own (and your intestines') risk. We'll definitely return."
"2.0","It was good, not great. Here's why: Our waiter forgot about us; the homemade mozzarella had no taste; my beet pasta had only beet water and no beets whatsoever even though it was labeled as beet pasta; the Caesar salad was not a true Caesar salad. We would not return."
"4.0","Great place for tacos! It's small and cozy. Perfect for a quick bite and take out. I had the carnitas and pollo tacos. To my surprise, they had a big selection of hot sauces. I'd recommend the mango habanero! Will visit again!"
"5.0","Honestly, never been here, but I want to give a shout out to this particular Eat N Park. My friend recently visited and here is his quote:'We had a fantastic hostess at enp who happened to have his pronouns on his name tag to allow for his identity while in transition! Glad enp is open and allowing its staff to be who they are!!!!'Thank you Banksville ENP for rolling with the times!"
"3.0","For a cafe attached to a museum/attraction, Cafe Phipps is like a 4.5, if not 5-star establishment.  In comparison to eateries in general, the food is fine but not outstanding.I love that the cafe uses local, in-season ingredients, and that it composts much of its waste.  Currently, it's one of two Pittsburgh eateries certified by the Green Restaurant Association.  Right now, the cafe has Friday happy hour, from 5-9 pm, which it calls 'Agave Nights,' in honor of the giant agave plant now at the conservatory.  $4 for margaritas, and $3 for beer, and popcorn shrimp or chicken nachos as food specials.  You can also order off their regular menu (which changes seasonally) up until 7 pm.  The falafel which is currently on the regular menu comes like a burger--as a single patty, on a bun.  The bun would have been better toasted.  I don't know how I felt about the blue cheese dressing on the patty, as opposed to a more traditional yogurt sauce or tahini sauce.  The cole slaw side was good in that the cabbage and carrot were fresh, but overall the slaw was too liquid-y and the random pieces of fruit (pineapple?) was rather strange.  I've also had a mushroom sandwich of some sort in the past here (not on the current menu), which was sort of bland.I wouldn't eat here unless I was also visiting the conservatory (which I really do recommend), but this is also one of the healthiest places to eat at in Oakland, and probably has the nicest atmosphere of all Oakland food places."
"5.0","Exceptional Bengali food.  Having lived in Dhaka for 3 years it hard to find good bengali food in the States.  This restaurant is the real deal!  Great food cooked by Bengali people!"
"5.0","One of my favorite brunch spots in the city! It is surely a popular one and they don't take reservations unless you have a large group so I would recommend going early or being prepared to wait a little!The food is absolutely delicious, I've never heard anyone with one compliant about their meal here. I've only had breakfast food here, but I imagine their dinner is just as good! The Eggplant Benedict is probably my favorite, but the Shrimp and Grits is a close second. They also have a bunch of juices and house sodas which always intrigue me, as well as a lot of different coffee drinks as well. Definitely do yourself a favor and check this place out! You will not be disappointed!!"
"3.0","Loud as hell... Didn't bother me until someone else mentioned it. But I can't even speak to the server or the person I'm with without having to raise my voice. It's not the music just voices. LolWent in on a Friday for happy hour. Super busy took a while to be seen and to get our drinks. When food came it was a little cold. Didn't really have a horrible experience but not the greatest. Happy hour prices aren't really that happy. The girl who was training to be server was very nice and polite, she'll do just fine!"

"2.0","Went here with a party of four.  They did not have enough seating due to reservations but could seat us at two two tops.  Upon leaving reserved tables STILL weren't taken (1.5 hours passed).  Someone should be supervising the seating a little better if they want to make more money and serve more customers. Dinners took forever and tables sat well after us were served before us (same meals).  Food mediocre.  Friends fries were ice cold.  Hubby had potatoes with his dinner and the portion was disgraceful (should've taken a photo - was the joke of the night). Drinks were served all to wrong people and each person was asked as they were served what they ordered - we fixed it after tasting each beer (bad mistakes for server for guests to straighten out the orders). Good thing we can taste the difference between an IPA and a sour beer!   Not worth the money to stop here for a mediocre meal and be served a beer that isn't correct - unless you want everyone in your party to sip it and tell which beer goes with which person.   Good thing we are all good friends but overall service and food just is unacceptable.  Also they cannot provide enough menus for food and beer to tables without waiting for other tables to finish using them.  Again good thing we were friends and could share menus upon finishing using them. For an establishment to not have an adequate amount of menus when they are not full and busy is strange.   Seems like a simple investment when you have paper beer menus and could invest in a few more food menus.  Just a thought if you're selling food and beer.  Hate to leave bad reviews but give credit where it's due.  This place could use some improvements for service and basic needs for customers."
"4.0","We thoroughly enjoyed lunch at Huszar on Thursday. Based on the recent positive publicity this homey Hungarian nook has received, I think lunch is a perfect option. The food was delicious, the folks were friendly, but it was very chill - we snagged a booth and relaxed. My dining companion and I both had Uborkasaláta (cucumber salad w/sour cream). Flavorful! I had the delicious Chicken Paprikás - creamy, comforting, with just enough paprika for a little kick. Dining companion had the Marhapörkölt (stewed beef) - it was restorative, after a very stressful week. But, oh my - the homemade dumplings! Reminded me of spaetzel. Delicious with both of our dishes, but I bet those little pasta pillows would be delightful with just butter and salt. It is as of a corner Pittsburgh bar with great Hungarian food time traveled from the 1950ies to today. But better!"
"3.0","The fucking workers there were bitches who do dishes but the chicken tho, that was good as balls"
"5.0","Been looking for something new for a breakfast place and came across this Bloomfield gem. We got French toasts and they were delicious! It was really hard to pick though because everything sounded really good lol. Also, the atmosphere is really lovely, so is the staff. We will definitely be back. Highly recommend!"
"5.0","Have you ever finished dinner and immediately started fantasizing about eating it all over again? Yeah, me neither. But if I ever did, this would be the one.Food: Beyond Excellent! I immediately had my eye on the 10 oz. Filet Mignon steak and ordered one cooked medium. Our waitress recommended various marinades and rubs, but the Kona coffee with shallot butter one piqued my interest. Well, it turned out to be 'I'm going to chew each and every bite of this ever so slowly so this lasts forever' kinda delicious, tender and juicy.We also all shared an order of the Lobster Mac 'N' Cheese, which was one of the best side dishes I've eaten in a long time. I probably could have just eaten a couple bowls of this and been happy the rest of the night. Dessert was Creme Brulee topped with blueberries, strawberries, raspberries and blackberries. Words cannot express what a delightful epilogue this was to the entire meal.Service: Top-notch! Our waitress was over-the-top friendly. Although slightly animated, she was knowledgeable, prompt, friendly and resourceful the entire time. Our water glasses never dipped below half-full and she even comped one of our desserts and our post-dinner coffees. Granted, it's not a huge deal for what you pay for all the entrees and drinks (the wine list is longer than the menu), but it was not required, but much appreciated.The good news is there are Capital Grille's all over the U.S. So, if you're smart, you'll make a reservation, throw on something nice, grab your wallet (fa sho) and enjoy a wonderful evening of wining and dining in style."
"5.0","The good was delicious and serve was quick and good! They had delicious vegetarian options!"
"5.0","Our family walked here after a show at the Byham Theater and it was absolutely delicious.  The manager was accommodating and rushed to find us a table.  The wait staff was fast and courteous and the food was outstanding.  Our party of six was pleasantly surprised at how amazing and delicious Redbeard's was!  We will be back!"
"5.0","Excellent Thai food in a simple but nicely decorated interior. The service is always very friendly. The place is clean. Love the BYOB. If you have never been careful on he spice scale. 6/10 starts to get pretty spicy and if you go up from there, you better be ready!  Overall wonderful for dine in or take out."
"3.0","The make it quickly and the price is good. 2 times was enough for me to pass on a 3rd. The cheese and sauce are not the best. I hope they can make some improvements as it's close and I would love to have a good shop close."
"4.0","I've been here several times and I have to say that they serve the BEST bloody mary's! Located in the Strip district, visitors and locals walk the streets to grab a bite and drink til their hearts desire. We decided to take some friends here this time during Memorial Weekend and it was crowded. I did see one empty table up front and quickly claimed that spot and told the hostess. However, she said that the wait time would be 30-45 minutes. Say what? I ain't got time for that. It's a good thing we got a bite to eat before having our second breakfast. I told the hostess that we were only there for drinks and we would be ordering quickly. She obliged. Yippie! We quickly got seated and ordered right away!Robert Wholey was walking by and stopped at our table to greet us. He was in civs so I didn't recognize him with his coat and hat but proudly stated that this was his son's place and that we needed to sit here as long as we liked because they need good looking people in the forefront. LOL I died... What a friendly man and yet he has a heart of gold!Anyways, because it's not in season we weren't able to order the softshell crab with our drinks. But we enjoyed the tomato-y peppery taste of our bloody mary's with candied bacon, a large stalk of celery, and chilled shrimps. It was delicious. (mine virgin of course) It was worth it! I'm buzzed off my baby so it is all good! My friends really enjoyed themselves.Other things that I have tried in the past were the lobster rolls (a must) and the key lime pie (better than the south! don't tell anyone i said that) and some other stuff. Overall, this place is a great place to hangout for brunch, grab a drink, and enjoy the day with your friends."
"3.0","First things first -- I enjoyed the cold brew and breakfast sandwich (smoked salmon) -- my friend's ham, egg, & cheese was just ok (heavy on the bread, light on the meat). Problem was having to wait 15+ min for the order; perhaps could increase staff on weekend mornings."
"3.0","Hungarian Goulash - a beef stew with potatoes, tomatoes, and traditional seasonings - 4 stars.Transylvanian Wooden Platter - chicken, pork, steak, fried potatoes, and side salad - 3.5 stars.Steak - grilled eye of round steak, onions, and fried potatoes - 3.5 stars.Apple strudel - did not taste fresh - 2 stars.Krémes - lady lock dough, vanilla custard, and whipped cream - not made in-house - 5 stars."
"3.0","Bizzare is the only word I have to define our experience here. I went within a few weeks of opening so take that into account as you read this review. We walked in on a Friday night and were sat immediately. They immediately brought us water, but it took a while to get service. We did finally get a server and tried to order drinks. They don't have a liquor license so they had complimentary wine and beer. They were out of beer and only had Moscato for wine. Moscato is too sweet for me so I stuck with the water.We ordered and all our food was good, but our service was just bizarre. Every time we asked a question we were met with weird answers or he would say yes, I'm just about to get that when clearly he'd just forgotten.The most bizarre part was when our friend ordered a California roll and he recommended upgrading to the Flipped Roll which is a roll with mango on top. It really wasn't similar to the California roll at all?The food was good, but I got the monster and flipped roll. Both had way too much sauce on them for my liking. If I give them another shot, I'd probably get to go food."
"5.0","We happened to stop here for lunch this weekend and we were so glad we did.  I had two tacos (siracha chicken and the pork) he had four (siracha chicken, regular chicken, pork, and beef) and we shared the nachos with meat.  Heaven.  Such wonderful food!  I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind a little hole in the wall place."
"2.0","I'm sorry, but I definitely do not like this place.  I absolutely hated the decor- I felt like I was in a 70s style Golden Corral. The extra room with live music was just not my kind of place, and the bar was super crowded with bartenders who weren't particularly nice or efficient. I can't speak for the food, which others here have said is average. I will not come here for brunch, and I would only go here again if I was in a group who insisted. They are many better places in Lawrenceville to spend your money."
"1.0","My buddy's buddy ordered a brownie, and let me tell ya, it was a catastrophe! He had to get TWO REPLACEMENT TEETH because the brownie was hard as a rock. If you like food that sits in a cold car for three hours, this is the place for you. When he called to figure this insanity out, the cashier said 'it's all okay' as if he had bit into this complete GARBAGE. Screw you Santosh. And screw you bardi"
"4.0","I made plans to grab dinner with a friend, and she mentioned Redfin Blues... I had never heard of it. Based on that, she decided it was worth introducing me to one of Pittsburgh's few waterside dining institutions.After reading a few reviews touting the food and service as subpar, I went in with low expectations.There was a bit of a wait, being that it was a sunny Saturday and the marina was bustling. I used No Wait to get in line before we arrived, which was incredibly helpful.All in all, the wait wasn't bad. We were seated after getting drinks at the bar and taking in so e scenery. We both ordered apps and a salad. My app arrived a good bit before the rest of our food, but it was fine. I got a crab cake as my app, and there was a good bit of crab, it was not mostly filler fluff. The wings were also pretty tasty. Note that the hot wings weren't very hot, so perfect for the less adventurous but not so much for spice fiends. The salads were a very fair size for the price, and the ratio of toppings to lettuce was spot-on. The waitstaff was pretty darn attentive for it being as packed as it was. Maybe they've improved since some of these reviews were posted? I'd like to go back another time when it's less crowded to enjoy the atmosphere and view a bit more."
"1.0","Do not go here before a game. The food tasted fine but the service was so delayed we almost missed the opening pitch. Our purpose of being in Pitt was the game so this was NOT the place for us!"
"5.0","I tried MR Bulgogi at the Pittsburgh taco festival and it was amazingly delicious. I had the beef taco and my friend had the pork and we split an order of fried dumplings. I think what really set everything off was the yummy sauces that complemented each item so perfectly. I also made sure to like the FB page so I can hopefully get to try them again sometime soon!!!"
"5.0","We visited the restaurant this past Friday and the food and service were so excellent that we decided to return today Sunday during our short visit to Pittsburgh. Tonight we were greeted by Aisha who remembered us and welcomed us back. Our server Keith was professional and gave great menu and drink advice and the GM Blaze came to see that we were satisfied with our meal. Food was excellent, drinks were great, attention was exceptional without being oppressive, space is well designed and inviting- i hope we can return in nicer weather, all aspects of service were outstanding.Over the two days we had the octopus and beef tartare (twice), the meat and cheese board, sausage fennel pizza and the shrimp diavolo."
"1.0","Got the peel and eat shrimp which I assumed was made to order, especially since it took 15 minutes to get to the table, it was not. It was the kind you get from the grocery store - on ice and over cooked. Our waiter forgot our orders 20 mins after we put them in.  Our orders, a Caesar salad with blackened salmon & a beer battered fish n' chips, were gross. The salmon was cooked too quickly and had those fatty white droplets coming out on the top, and it was raw in the middle (not rare - RAW). The fries were obviously from frozen and lacked any kind of crispness. The beer battered fish was also mushy as well as completely tasteless. We left both of our meals uneaten. When the server finally came around he asked if we wanted a box, not how the meal was. I said no, the fish was raw and I wasn't going to eat it or the salad. He replied with 'well it's sushi grade' and took our plates away. No apology, no offer to recook the fish, nothing. His service was shitty otherwise, only asked to refill our drinks once the entire time, never checked on our table, etc. People around us also seemed unsatisfied with the food/service. Not worth the view unfortunately, won't be back."
"4.0","Love coming here for morning bagels. The manager is always funny and nice. Just a walk away from my place so might as well enjoy it. I've never gotten a wrong order in the past 2 years."
"5.0","I'm so happy my friend invited me to this special place. The food is delicious, fresh and beautiful. Love the atmosphere and open kitchen."
"3.0","Went during Crab fest. Our waiter was really nice and checked in on us frequently, even when the place was packed.Had fried calamari as an appetizer - it was waaaaayyy to breaded and fried.For the entree I ordered a pound of the Dungeness Crab legs which was $19 per pound. Flavor was nice, not too salty, and probably more preferred than the more expensive crab legs, like Snow or King."
"3.0","Stoped I'm on a whim. Pretty cool open space. Sat outside which is nice to do in Market Square. On the good- Beer selection On the great - Food. Had the Tuna tacos and had the fish tacos. (Split with my wife) Amazing flavors. Excellent!  Good value.  On the ok was the staff. It seemed like it was killing our hostess to smile. None of the wait staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Our waiter was very nice and friendly, but the service was slow. For me, I go out for the experience, not just food. I would go back because the food is that good, I just won't expect a pleasant experience. Shame...3-1/2 stars because it's better than average, could be amazing."
"4.0","I initially came with pretty low expectations because it had 3.5 stars but I left impressed!! We went on a Saturday morning and there was no wait for us so we got seated right away. The building lets a lot of sunlight come in and we were seated in the back so it was breezy and nice. I ordered the avocado omelette and my friend ordered eggs cooked in the red sauce (don't remember the name) The omelette was good! Fluffy and thick with a dollop of fresh salsa and guac on top, I wasn't disappointed. I loved how they included a slice of watermelon because after the flavor heavy egg and the buttery bread it was so refreshing. My friend also enjoyed the eggs very much. I liked this place because it was unique, breakfast places can make the mistake of being too generic but the environment and food of this place was memorable. Service was alright - right after we got our food, our waitress placed the check on our table so I definitively felt a bit rushed. Will be returning in the future!"
"3.0","Here is yet another example of wishing we could give half stars. I would have given them 3.5 stars. The pics show what I have had and the soup is always hot and good. The steak on the stick was also really good. Place is always packed at lunch during the week, so get there early if you can. I have been there 4 times so far and will keep going back unless something changes. I always go for the soup but I will have to try something other than that. Their prices are on point also; no crazy prices that I noticed on the menu. Note to owners: Please get garlic chips for the soup. Thank you...."
"3.0","We recently moved to Pittsburgh and wanted to try a good sushi restaurant. After reading the reviews we decided to try out Kiku.The place is a little tricky to find if you're not familiar with the area. Restaurant seemed nice and everyone was very friendly. Although the sushi wasn't horrible, it wasn't that great either. I'm not sure if we caught them on a bad night considering it was Sunday. They seemed sloppy and rushed. Not a lot of care was given into the rolls as they were falling apart. Ingredients within the rolls didn't taste fresh either nor were they consistent within the same roll. Overall, I would try it again at some point but after I've tried other places first."
"5.0","This place is an excellent spot in Bloomfield. Went here tonight, they were semi-busy for a Wednesday night. The restaurant space is nothing too exciting but seemed clean. They are a BYOB so plan accordingly. The service was fantastic and everything came out very quick. We started with the spring rolls which were very good. I then had the Pad Thai which is usually what I get when I try a new Thai place (I'm pretty vanilla). Their's was probably the best I've had in Pittsburgh. They do spice from 1-10, their 8/10 definitely had more of a kick than other 8/10s. It's a good portion size. The prices are better than comparable places as well. Overall, great food and service, will definitely be back."
"4.0","This place was everything you'd expect, which is a good thing. Clean interior, a pizza with unlimited toppings for $8, and a decent staff. Is it the best pizza I've ever had? No, but it was $8. Is it the best food in Lawrenceville? No, but they're one of the only places open on a Sunday evening or Monday."
"4.0","This was one of our favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh before they shut down. They have been closed for a few months after a pipe bursted on the floor above them, but reopened a week ago. I noticed a couple changes to the menu that disappointed me on our first time back. The one blaring change was the switch from Spanish menu options like 'pinxtos' to small plates. They also removed the 'montaditos' options which was one of my favorite courses. The main thing that drew me too this restaurant initially was the feeling of being immersed Basque culture. However, like other restaurants, they 'dumb' down their menus to appease the masses. I really thought Justin Severino was above that but I guess no one is immune. The food is still excellently prepared and service is impeccable. We were even given a complementary glass of wine while the bottle we ordered was chilling. Morcilla offers an incredible selection of Sherry's and wine. I am just distraught to see one of my favorite restaurants back slide."
"4.0","We stopped into City Works on a whim to escape the cold this past weekend. It was a Saturday afternoon which was the perfect time to go. They had a huge selection of beer on tap (they also offer wine on tap as well), a lot of big screen tv's (great for watching football, hockey, etc.) and a great looking menu. Since it was the middle of the afternoon we didn't order any entrees. But I did order the soft pretzels bites as an app and they were yummy. The order was a bit small so not ideal for sharing with a lot of people. But the beer and atmosphere was great. I deducted a star only because our service was a little slow but other than that I really enjoyed this place and I'm sure I will be back again soon."
"4.0","Dig the ambiance, and the menu. It a huge menu and really reasonably priced. This was some of the best Thai food I've had in Pittsburgh. There's some places that claim to be Thai - this place IS Thai.I had one of their curry dishes, and my date had the fried rice. Both were portions were relatively large, especially considering the price. The spring rolls were fantastic too. If you're in Bloomfield or Lawrenceville, this place is definitely worth the trip."
"4.0","The long narrow staircase, vibrant wallpaper, neon signs, and intimate third floor space make Umami feel unlike any other restaurant in Pittsburgh. We arrived right at our reservation time and were seated immediately. Since this was our first time at Umami, our excellent server, Elizabeth, explained the izakaya style in which the food is served. The food is prepared pretty quickly, so you place multiple orders rather than ordering everything at once. Elizabeth and others checked on us frequently to ask if we needed anything.The menu obviously sets Umami apart as well. My table ordered skewers (chicken thigh, pork belly, chicken heart, and chicken skin), hand rolls (yellowtail and mackerel), ramen, and yatai (fried chicken, octopus balls, and eggplant with ground chicken). Everything was delicious except for the ramen, which we all agreed lacked flavor, even with the chili sauce. Next time I'll just stick with the yatai dishes, which were small plates of fried Japanese-style street food.There's a lot of great options to try at Umami, so my advice would be to bypass the ramen and sushi, which you get elsewhere, and stick with the unique and memorable flavors of the fried street foods!"
"4.0","Came here for some breakfast/lunch on a Friday afternoon.  Overall I was very impressed.  It definitely had a cozy and casual feel that I enjoyed. My friend got the cheesey omelette, potatoes, fruit, and a side of bacon.  It looked wonderful and she raved about it.  The omelette was HUGE, you will certainly not walk away hungry.  I got the curry chicken salad and a fruit bowl.  I must say, I would come back just to get this again.  It was spot on what I wanted.  the fruit bowl was also full of fresh fruit and another great portion.Service was friendly and I never wanted for a full water glass.The only negative I have about it was the time it took to be served.  It was...a noticeable while.  We didn't mind because we were there to catch up and chat, but if I was there because I was super hungry, I'd have gotten antsy.All in all would definitely go again and have to force myself to order something else because everything on the menu looked and sounded good."
"1.0","*Update: 2 stars down to 1 starThe owner of the restaurant commented on this post and told me to message her directly. I did so and she never got back to me. One thing is consistent about this place: bad service. I love the Buca di Beppos from Cleveland and Columbus so I expected the Pittsburgh one to be consistent, but the poor service tarnishes this location. The host and other waitresses were friendly enough but our particular waitress was sloppy and pretty terrible overall. I came in for my birthday dinner and left with a disappointed experience. Waitress mistakes/incompetencies:-sneakily charged us for the garlic bread when we straight up asked whether this was an appetizer. Her exact answer was 'No, it's not an appetizer but did you want to make it one?' Such a weird response so we ordered it, thinking it was free. NOPE. $7.99 for about 6 chunks of bread. Toasty and garlicky but totally not worth it-proclaimed that she would sing for my birthday and I replied 'yeah, bring it on!' She asked the couple seated next to us if I would like her to sing twice and I said 'only once is fine...' VERY odd way of doing this...and for the rest of the meal she did not sing at all. False advertisement!-I opted to create my own pasta and she didn't put in 2 of the main ingredients: mild sausage and poached garlic. On the receipt, it was clear that it was her own fault b/c those ingredients weren't not entered. UGH!-had NO idea how coupons worked and asked me to show her over and over again my coupon emails. Went back and forth and even told me to make an electronic reservation online in order to activate the coupon. What? Definitely unnecessary and did not work. I forgot her name but she wore her wispy blond her in a messy bun and had a lackluster attitude. The food itself tasted fine and the portions were large but really was hoping this place would start offering free bread. Also, walking through the open kitchen to get to the bathroom seems unhygienic and totally bad fengshui. I'm probably never coming back to this location.*Note- my husband still tipped over 20% on our bill even though there was no reason to..."
"5.0","Small but organized and fast. Food was good. I got the mushroom philly cheese steak and the fries. Fries were hot and crispyand idk, I guess I'm not a Philly cheesesteak fan. Nothing was wrong with it... Just should have gotten a burger or a salad... Everything was great. Cash only though(smart on their part)"
"1.0","I placed a takeout order from Yuva through GrubHub. It said the order would be ready in 30 minutes and so I arrived 20 minutes after I ordered it, expecting to wait a few minutes after I found a parking spot (no easy feat on S. Craig St.). When I got inside and told the lady at the counter that I was picking up a takeout order, she said they still had not received it. As I was calling GrubHub customer service, she 'happened' to find it as I got through to an agent and rushed it to the kitchen. I asked the agent to look into it and admittedly the order failed to be delivered the first two times, whether due to a failing on GrubHub's part or Yuva's part, I do not know. However, it was confirmed that the order had made it through ten minutes earlier.At long last, when we had our food and made it home, we tried the food and were utterly disappointed. The samosas were poor compared to others I have had, a tough maneuver to pull off given they are usually frozen samosas anyhow. We also had bhaigan bhartha and kofta curry (known at authentic Indian places as malai kofta), both of which were a major disappointment. I have had malai kofta at many different Indian restaurants and this was the least flavorful I have ever experienced. The bhaigan bhartha, on the other hand, was charred so much that the smoke level nearly exceeded every Scotch in existence. We requested that both be made spicy and neither were. I will certainly never be going back. I highly recommend Taj Mahal on McKnight and Taste of India near the Children's Hospital if you want actually good Indian food."

"5.0","Great italian food! Warm and wonderful ambiance , super friendly service. I can't wait to go back!"
"3.0","Eh, I wasn't particularly impressed with my time at Redbeard's.The good: On Wednesdays all day, they have all you can eat wings and chips for $10. Great deal considering 10 wings off of their menu are $10 themselves. You can only choose one flavor at a time. You start off with ten and then receive them by 5's. For my first batch, I tried the honey bbq which was good (i love honey bbq) The second batch, I ordered the Redbeard's Signature sauce- sweet chili sauce, BBQ sauce & some hot sauce. I really enjoyed that sauce. Their chips are nice too and are seasoned with a litte kick of something.. can't put my finger on it.The Average: Everything else. Our service really wasn't too good. She seemed to be new and we waited awhile to put in our order. In her defense, I do believe she was new  because she pulled out a list whenever we asked her what the craft beer options were. For drinks, we started off with a long island each.. terrible! Too much Sours were in that drink which literally can ruin the drink.. and it did. Also, at the end of the night we found out that each long island was $12. wtf?! $24 on 2 crappy drinks? We gulped the drink to get it over with then ordered 2 vodka and orange juice.. aka a tall glass of OJ and a splash of vodka. So in conclusion on drinks.. We spent $20 each on drinks  ($40 total) and didnt even walk out of there with a buzz. -_- Also, Bobby ordered the stuffed mushrooms with crab (appetizer) to eat. It was completely bland and both the mushroom and crab were not seasoned. It would've been completely delicious with a nicely seasoned mushroom and a tad of old bay on the crab.The menu seemed large and had nice selections.. pub food plus some entrees. If we do stop back it will be for all you can eat wings.. and we will stop there. Totally disappointed with both the food & drinks for what the final bill ended up being :("
"5.0","I enjoy all of the levels of Sienna Mercado, but my love of grazing on cheese makes me a dedicated fan of Mezzo.On one particular visit with a friend, we ordered a charcuterie board and mushroom pizza to share (paired with a couple glasses of wine a piece). Everything was delicious and the charcuterie was varied and we'll paired with the cheeses."
"2.0","just to update my review. My visit did not change, my review will not change but they did reach out to me and have tried to 'make it better' by being willing to give me credit to the establishment and to try it again. unfortunately, I can't since this was a visit during a business conference and unless there is one near me, this gift card will not be used. But I did appreciate their concern and willingness to let me 'try' them again and see if they couldn't sway my idea of their establishment. good luck and thank you for your reaching out to me. This gift card will be sent to someone that lives in that area and maybe they will have a better time with it."
"5.0","We went to their market a few days ago.  It was off the hook.  When we returned, we gave the restaurant a try.  The service was just as amazing as the market.  The food, fresh and well prepared.  You can't go wrong with either."
"5.0","Heather the bar tender is fantastic. She was super nice and helpful. The food was great. The atmosphere was good and plenty of tv's to watch the game. Definitely a place to stop at when in town."
"1.0","Don't do it, unless you are desperate. I had the vegetable chow mein. It was about 90% partly fried onion, and the rest had some molecules of corn, mushrooms, and sprouted beans, in a tasteless liquid. It is ridiculously cheap, and ridiculously bad. Bathroom was clean. I strongly suggest you keep walking!"
"4.0","Definitely pricey for ramen, especially with add-ons, but the broth was good and the noodles tasted freshly made. I can't quite remember what my husband ordered but I had the Shio ramen. The star for me was the meat bao - more memorable than my ramen dish but to be fair, I'm not exactly a huge fan of ramen. In other words, I never crave it. But I could easily eat 12 of those meat baos :)"
"3.0","My 16oz $6.50 juice was over 50% ice cubes. The juice was great but the price point is about as disappointing and painful as getting a nipple caught in a zipper. Considering the juice is pre-made in house and refrigerated, definitely NOT worth it. The coffee is alright. The atmosphere is nice and the music is decent for working."
"3.0","Tram's is a pretty small place, and when first coming here, the interior reminded me your typical cheap Chinese restaurant. But the setting is fine for eating. I don't expect anything fancy.I got the pho tai, which was not bad. They filled up a big bowl and also had hosin sauce and whatever that red rooster hot sauce (whatever it's called) for the optional additional flavor. In comparison to some of the other pho that I have had, I didn't find the broth to be as flavorful. Everything tasted fresh, though.We also got egg rolls and spring rolls. They were both good. I preferred the spring rolls.Service was a little slow. We had to flag down our waiter, but that's not too big a deal. I also felt that the preparation could have been quicker, but I don't know jack about making Vietnamese food besides comparisons to other restaurants.Overall, this place isn't bad, and I'd recommend you check it out if it's close by. My one friend recommended another place in Pittsburgh, but I can't remember the name and I'm too lazy to ask him. Maybe I'll update later and let you know. I'm a big help, right?"
"5.0","Really cute! Would have loved to spend a little more time there while in town. I tried the alone Fog: Earl Grey, steamed milk and water. It was really good and perfect for the chilly day it was. The barista was really nice and gave us some great restaurant recommendations!"
"1.0","I loved this place but they just got hit with a consumer alertafter an inspection turned up more than a dozen serious food safety violations. Today is June 20, 2017.Details linked here from the Post-Gazette and are available from the Health Dept. so you have to decide for yourself.http://www.post-gazette.com/business/healthcare-business/2017/06/20/Beta-Bites-inspection-consumer-alert/stories/201706200107I'm rooting for them - I hope they pull it back together."
"4.0","I haven't try any indian food before. This restaurant refresh my thought on Indian food. They are great. The narr is a must-try. The sauce of the entree is delicious. Eat the sauce with narr. One thing you need to note is that the meal comes out quite slow. Maybe i came quite early at that time."
"3.0","We made reservations for Thursday evening at 7 PM and found it fairly crowded, but with spots still available. The venue is intimate and decor is nice, perhaps our favorite part of the experience.We waited a bit for service, a bit of a miss. It was a wait before our server came. I ordered tuna onigiri and robatayaki (squid as the red snapper that is so photographed in these reviews was unavailable) and hubs ordered chirashi. The onigiri comes out. We're perplexed as how to approach it. We're looking around and I see others picking at it, using a soy sauce bowl to dip. Unfortunately, there's no soy sauce bowl or server around. Blah. I attack it nonetheless. It works. Taste wise, it is very average. The scallions were very mild and it was more rice than anything. A soy sauce bowl would have done wonders. I ended up spreading the wasabi using chopsticks. The squid comes as I'm working on the onigiri. Hubs has a few bites as he waits for his dish. I've finished and start on the squid for a bit before the chirashi arrives.The squid is colder than I'd like, considering it was off the flames. Hubs thought it was his favorite item. His chirashi was very average. It was an elaborate presentation like the onigiri, but nothing that left us wowed.Service wasn't attentive for us. Another couple sat next to our table as we were wrapping up and they were offered greater service and attention, offered tap versus sparkling as we were given regular tap, without so much as an offer for something else.No rush to go back."
"3.0","I thought the food was decent. The overall dining experience is all right. I appreciate the low-key environment, it's a very relaxed setting (at least when I went). Pho: I had their wonton soup and chicken pho. The wontons tasted very good, but I wouldn't go so far as to say they were memorable in any way. I would also say the same for the soup. I wish they provided basil, more limes, and more bean sprouts to add into the soup. Noodles were prepared very well and were definitely of the right texture.Spring rolls: I wasn't a particular fan, perhaps because of my preference for what goes into spring rolls. With the hoisin-based sauce, they were satisfying.Together, I'd say that the dishes i had above were good and satisfying but not memorable, simply because I've had so much Vietnamese food in southern California that I believe I've just had a greater selection of things that appealed to my preference. I would recommend if you're craving a light meal with south-east asian flavors but not looking for something to blow your mind."
"2.0","THIS was in reply to comment left by restaurant, which was subsequently deleted.  The owner asked why I didn't complain about the oxidized greasy mess of potatoes.  Here is my reply.  (My original review is below. Read it before orderingHere).  No I did not bring up potatoes with waitress as she recommended them. When food is as 'off' as it was at your restaurant, I make the assumption that if this food is served and offered as high quality, we are not on the same page regarding freshness and quality, and a critique would not be understood and considered rude.  The potatoes were not 'made to order' as you know.  A square was cut from a pan that was stored in  your frig overnight. Even if freshly made (they were not) the dish was dry and flavorless.  Made worse by reheating.The steak was more or less cooked to order - it was med rare - but it was not high quality and was flavorless.  I didnt think it appropriate to get into a discussion (in a restaurant where one really cannot hear fellow diners anyway) about the rightful expectation that a $36 steak would be better than what i might 'fry' at home from the corner market. Actually, it wasnt even that good."
"4.0","A dive in the all the best ways! Pretty great dogs, awesome fries, and build-your-own beer packs! Cheap and easy. Right across from a parking lot on the Mount."
"3.0","Too hungry to make it all the way home the other night, a drained, hungered, athirst Kay and Darren made their way to Mt. Washington for refreshment and comfort on a scalding, congested day. What we found was the illegitimate son of D's Sixpax and Dogs from Regent Square. Upon entering, our ears were assailed by stridently played-to-death selections from AC/DC and Motley Crue. The music was blaring so much that the gent taking our order at the red-and- silver, diner-style counter could hardly hear my words. I should have brought my earplugs. Like another reviewer, I too ordered the Golden Retriever, a Steeltown take on a Chi-Town classic complete with all the appropriate accessories (radioactive relish, dill pickles, tomatoes, celery salt, school bus-yellow mustard, and sport peppers). The frank itself was grilled immaculately, its natural casing snapping like bubble wrap with every breach of my incisors, its juicy beef essence permeating each chomp, the accompanying toppings only enhancing and never distracting from the proteins at hand. And the fries were ochroid spud cudgels par excellence with their coats of outer crispness and plush insides. The bacon cheeseburger might have been a winner had it been cooked to medium rare instead of well-done. Judging by the dense texture, I suspect it may have been in a freezer a bit too long as well. The bacon was very crisp, however, and the other fixings, including the bakery-quality bun (used for the dog also. did they both come from Grandview Bakery?), were plentiful and fresh.Packs and Dogs has an odd mancave/greasy spoon/bro-bar vibe about it that I'm not sure works. As I alluded to before, the music was entirely too loud, especially considering that this was an early Thursday evening and that attendance was scant; it was as if a kegger party was being held and hardly anyone showed up. A MMA program could be seen on the flatscreen telly on the wall, but due to the noise (and I love loud, heavy music, just not when I'm trying to eat at a restaurant) we couldn't hear anything uttered by Joe Rogan or the muscled, deformed-of-ear fighters he was interviewing. Leather couches, a jukebox, and a dart board populate the front, which I suppose is intended to create a comfortable ambience, but I cannot imagine that being the case at P&D's on a sultry, intoxicated Saturday night. While quite obviously a copycat of the East End's version, Mt. Washington's Packs and Dogs misses the bullseye in terms of atmosphere despite making mighty fine hot dogs and french fries. You can relax at D's. Here? Not so much, I reckon. At P&D's busiest, you may have luck getting into a fight, finding a liason, drinking yourself into the gutter, or simply garnering attention to your tanned, scarcely-garbed self.  P.S. Packs and Dogs would be an effortless 4 stars if it was just a hot dog stand and nothing more."
"1.0","This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had in an Indian restaurant. Everywhere online (google, yelp) the timing showed 10pm closing, and we made it to the restaurant at 9:10pm and we were told only take out orders as they were closing. When we said there is still time to close the lady was like it will take at least 20 mins to make your food and then it will be time to close. Never experienced such rudeness and lack of interest in an Indian restaurant before."
"4.0","Clean and cute cafe! The people who work there are very friendly and personable. I had an incredibly difficult time deciding on what to buy because all the sweets seemed so novel! There were chocolate peanut butter pies, banana walnut cupcakes, caramel apple pies, and the like. In the end I decided on a slice of cheesecake and a red velvet bar with what looked like cream cheese frosting swirled on the surface and baked with the bar.The cheesecake was SO rich and sweet that even as someone with a major sweet tooth, I found it cloying after about 3/4 of it. The other customer who ordered it as dessert had to split it with two other people for that reason too.The red velvet bar didn't have the characteristic taste of red velvet though. It didn't even taste of chocolate/cocoa at all, which I found odd. And both cakes had bits of paper stuck to the bottom, so I probably ingested quite a bit before feeling a piece in my mouth.I do, however, like that they just make 'whatever they feel like' that day, as it makes for a pleasant surprise every visit.For my second visit, I tried the 'peppermint stick' and 'strawberry cheesecake' ice cream flavors. Peppermint taste was strong without being overpowering - wonderful flavor. Strawberry cheesecake was tougher to identify, though the strawberry part definitely provided plenty of flavor. They weren't so much creamy as icy.I definitely have to stop by again to try the sandwiches!"
"4.0","First visit to CG and had very pleasant experience. Not a fan of most chain restaurants, especially of the upscale, but CG lived up to its reputation. Had business lunch in a bit of a rush but my grilled salmon over Cesar salad was fresh and delicious. Service was accommodating for our group."
"5.0","Trams is one of my go-to places for comfort food, especially on rainy chilly days! I cant even count how often I've been there in my 15yrs in Pgh, and it's perfect every time. I love the close knit and cozy atmosphere, the lovely people that run it, and of course-the food. this will always be one of my spots in the ever changing neighborhood I live in."
"5.0","Dinner was delicious, portion sizes were plentiful, and the ambiance is great. I do not even like meat, but the people I went with do and raves about the meat dishes. I liked the Seafood and vegetarian options so much. I don't live in Pittsburgh but will be coming back to Morcilla whenever I come back. I enjoyed the wine selection and the attentive/ knowledgeable staff. It was a pleasure to dine here."
"4.0","Service is awesome and fast! Food is delicious, I got the Forest Hills since it's where my parents live (ha!) and I was hardly disappointed. I've never had honey on my burger before but it was completely done correctly. The side salad of mixed greens was also fresh and tasty. My friend had the pickle chicken and that blew my mind as well, unbelievably good. Never had it before then. Report of my friend is that the house beer was pretty good and the stout she tried (there are many) was surprisingly tasty. Definitely seems like an amazing place for a good beer just from looking around. The biggest downside of this place is the volume, literally it's hard to hear yourself think, so this really isn't a good spot for a date or even really catching up with friends butttt if you want a stiff drink with a novel 'burgers by neighborhood' theme in a fun space with friendly and attentive staff, then this place is worth checking out!"
"3.0","Yes, everyone and their brother is blowing up Station with good reason- the food is fantastic.  However, the prices are absolutely absurd, especially for Pittsburgh.  Similarly situated restaurants who use equally local/organic ingredients charge half of what Station does.  Every dish is great, but be prepared to break the bank to eat here."
"4.0","Note: The beer selection is heavenly.Pennsylvania's archaic alcohol laws make it difficult to find stores with a wide variety of beer without having to buy a case, so coming here was refreshing. The mix and match six pack deal is nice because they take $4.50 off the total of the individually marked bottles. Beers vary a lot in price, but are mostly are in the $3 to $4 range.I had been to Packs & Dogs before, when I lived in Mt. Washington about five years ago, but hadn't been back until I met a few friends there recently. Since then they've expanded their menu to include more apps and sandwiches.Ordered a beer, a six pack (which you can't drink there), and a soft pretzel served with Yuengling beer cheese.I'll save room for a hot dog during my next visit."
"2.0","I want to like this place sooo much but the food just isn't fresh. I usually end up with an upset stomach afterwards, even if all I order is rice and veggies. Bummer."
"5.0","I'm a Duquesne student. This is my favorite CHINESE restaurant!! Food is always fresh and tasty. Love their hot pepper chicken!"
"2.0","I went to this restaurant because of comments so this is a Warning: over rated. Low quality meat. Service okay. Half my sandwich had no meat. Burger meat was like Salisbury steak, just not what I expected. Try some where else."
"5.0","Best ramen in Pittsburgh! Everything is delicious and fresh. Our go-to date night place!"
"1.0","If I could give them negative stars I would. They sat us and we waited for 20 mins...and still no one had taken our order or even acknowledged us. I eventually went to the bar to see if a waiter or waitress could come over and the bartender told me we wouldn't be getting a waiter so we had to just order from her. It was absolutely ridiculous. Several tables around us were getting served so there is no reason they should have sat us without a waiter accessible. The food looked disgusting anyways so we ended up just leaving."
"5.0","5 stars because this place deserves it!I had been here several times before this weekend, but I didn't know if I liked it to much because of the company or the wine, but it's clear that the food is amazing!We started off with the fresh made mozzarella. This is a steal! $12 for a heaping mound of prosciutto, olives, roasted red peppers, and a delicious ball of mozzarella topped with coarse salt, EVOO, and balsamic. I literally have dreams about this dish.For the next course we ordered the octopus polenta. The octopus was grilled and tender and served with a creamy polenta and a tasty romesco sauce. Delightful.For the final course, we order the rolto. It's like they take a slice of lasagna and bake it in a shallow dish so every part is like the crispy corner of a traditional lasagna. So good.I definitely recommend eating there. I will definitely be trying their multi course dinner on an upcoming Sunday."
"4.0","I was visiting Pittsburgh to see some friends and family of my fiancé. I had the privilege of eating here a couple of times during our stay. Both times were absolutely delightful experience! The food is fantastic. I ate a breakfast burrito the first time and a salad the second. Both were really well made, fresh, and generous proportions. On top of that the servers were phenomenal. Really down to earth, friendly, and welcoming the minute you step in the door. The inside of the restaurant could use a little updating eventually. It feels and looks inside like it probably did since the day it first opened its doors. I do love the atmosphere, the people, and especially the food! I guess the owners figured, why change a good thing? It's great place to eat at, I'll definitely be back again!"
"5.0","Ive has this place bookmarked for months and was so happy to finally be able to try it out while catching up with a friend. This place is great for anyone who enjoys trying out several things on the menu as their food is meant to be shared, offering a selection of snack sized, small, and large portioned tapas. We went with the warm crisp bread served with olive oil dipping sauce, croquettes filled with salted cod and honey dipping sauce (the contrast of flavors between the sour lemon garnish, warm croquette, and sweet honey was a divine combination), the scallop curdo bathed in a salsa verde sauce, and finally the trout, served as an entire whole fish, simple yet full of flavor. To top it all off, we shared the Crema Catalina, their take on the traditional French Creme Brulee dessert, which while similar in flavor, offers a unique contrast with warm burnt sugar top coating over a cold bed of custard."
"2.0","This is one of the worst Indian food I've had in a while. I went there for the dinner buffet and started with the appetizers. The pakoras were too dry. They had no taste in them. The chicken biryani was basically uncooked rice with small pieces of unsavory chicken. And the Tandoori chicken had an unusual smell to it. Coming to the main course: The chicken tikka masala had a rubber-like texture. The saag and the malai kofta, even though had rich gravy, had practically the same taste (too buttery). The chicken curry was good. The only thing I really liked about the food was the dessert. They had mango ice cream, kheer and gulab jamun. Conclusion: If you guys want to taste authentic Indian food, avoid this place! This will leave a bad taste in your mouth. It does not justify the $12 ($10 on student ID) price tag. I would not go there again. Also, my two stars for this place is solely because of the desserts."
"5.0","My favorite tacos in Pittsburgh! Nice portion sizes and a great price. The sauces are all delicious. I like to get the Dino bowl, and the pork is probably my favorite. It is in South Side so it's a popular drunk food spot."
"5.0","George was probably one of the top ten waiters we have had in our 64 years of life. We went to  Jerome Bettis Grill 36 after a Heinz Field stadium tour. We were pleased with the great wings and salad and the very attentive attention George gave to our two grandsons age 6 and 9, on their very first visit to Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh was our home town for 40 years and we  wanted to share with our grandsons our home town and  the Steeler Nation.George and Jerome Bettis grill 36 only added to a perfect Steeler win and a wonderful weekend in Pittsburgh. Did I mention good food and a TV replay of the Steeler /Panther game which made for a wonderful dining experience.JLuttnerNew Bern,NC"
"5.0","Great breakfast sandwiches and strong coffee. Throw in the friendly service and fun games and you don't need much more."
"4.0","Stumbled upon Quik-It Chicken on the 4th of July...we were very happy it was open since many places were closed.The ribs...this beef was remarkable. These are literally the best ribs I have ever eaten.Also, the cornbread was on point.Very affordable overall, especially for the chicken/meat.Don't judge a place by it's location, looks, or the surrounding area. Just because it's in a less-developed part of the city doesn't mean it's not quality eats.The bathrooms were a little dirty/under-maintained, that would be my biggest qualm. Additionally, the greens were overly salty.The owner was friendly and engaging. I will be back."
"2.0","We have celebrated birthdays at Ruths Chris Steak House for years, but after our experience this year, we may be searching for another option. We met my son and his girlfriend for his birthday at the end of December. We were glad to see the renovations as the restaurant looked more open and inviting than it used to. But from that first impression, the evening went downhill. The place wasn't very busy for a night in December, which was alittle surprising.  My son's girlfriend ordered a filet - medium rare. When the meal was delivered, the steak was well done. Ok..a mistake and the server said another one would be brought out shortly. She waited while we began to eat our meal. Several minutes later, another steak was delivered...again over cooked. We again sent it back and were assured that shortly another steak would be brought out. By this time, the rest of us were half done with our meal. Finally, a third steak was delivered....it was Blood Rare! When we again called the server over, she agreed it was not cooked as requested and  a manager came to the table. He suggested that they bring out a hot plate to continue cooking the steak at the table. Now I can understand one mistake at a high end restaurant like Ruths but three times a steak is brought out wrong at a Steakhouse! It surely put a damper on our evening celebration as she just ate the side dishes and ended up taking the last steak home to finish cooking it there. Our bill was well over $400.00 and I left there feeling very bad. The next day I sent a letter to Customer Service on their website and never received a call or email back. Very poor customer service."
"4.0","I came here for dinner last night with a friend and it met my eager expectations - was not below/did not succeed, but definitely worth checking out! I have never had Japanese street food before so this was a great introduction to it. Between the two of us, we had the plain onigiri, the tuna onigiri, the takoyaki (essentially octopus fritters), nasu shigiyaki (japanese eggplant with chicken) and the chicken hearts cooked on the grill. The plain onigiri was pretty meh, I would probably suggest getting the tuna one as my friend thought his had a lot of flavor comparatively to mine. Both the takoyaki and nasu shigiyaki were really good! The takoyaki was crisp on the outside and more chewy on the inside served with shredded beets. The Nasu dish was simple, slightly sweet, but very good!As for chicken hearts - YOLO and go for it. If you get over the texture it's really not bad ;)Next time, I am definitely going to check out their drinks!"
"1.0","First off, hats off to our server, who was really attentive and nice. My girlfriend and I stopped by the previous day to check the place out and he wisely advised us to download the 'inLine' app which digitally allows you to reserve a place in line w/o physically being there. A great tip since, he advised us, the wait to get in can be up to an hour.So we show up Sunday morning, and thanks to InLine, we were quickly seated. He took our orders with a smile and our coffees arrived pretty quickly. That concludes the positive portion of this review.Now for the negative, which is enormous. We proceeded to sit there for literally an hour, waiting for our food.The waiter came by several times to tell us it would be out soon, but it still didn't arrive.  We looked around: there were five other tables full of people in our area of the restaurant. None of them had received any food. It was as if no cooking was being done in the kitchen *at all*.Finally, at the 70 minute mark, I went up and tried to gently ask the cashier (who I'm told is also the owner) when we could expect to be served. She interrupted me and snippily assured me a 45min to an hour wait was 'normal on the weekend.' Interesting. I wonder why, then, we weren't told that before we were made to wait for an hour? Also, it had been *over* an hour. I dropped payment for coffees and tip on the table, and my girlfriend and I split. Our other companions remained. Their food arrived 15 additional minutes later, and one dish had a hair in it. Needless to say they, and I, won't be returning.  By the way, about 15 minutes earlier we'd seen another angry conversation between the cashier and another customer, who also walked out. Dunno what it was about, but let's say I wasn't seeing lots of smiling places in the establishment that afternoon.PS: check other recent one-star reviews for Coca, complaining of the same problem. This joint appears to melt down on the weekends. There are several other brunch spots in the immediate neighborhood. Try those."
"5.0","Great food at an appropriate price. So glad I stopped there. I had s burrito and it was so delicious. I am usually not a fan of salsa verde but it complimented the dish very well. If you go to market square I highly recommend a stop if you are in the mood for Mexican food."
"5.0","Very glad Yelp recommended this place to me. I came on a Friday evening at 6 PM and ordered a chicken sharmola sub for $8.55 after tax, which came with fries. Wait for food took about 13 minutes, a very reasonable time given the 1-2 customers before me.As for the food, all I can say is wow. The chicken was so, so tender and had a nice coating of spice. The bread was fresh and soft and packed with vegetables. The special beta bites dressing tasted like a variation of thousand island dressing perhaps mixed with curry and a touch of vinegar, and the slightly sour taste added a wonderful flavor to the sub. Also, the sub was huge - about 7-8 inches I'd say - as well as thick, so very fillingThe fries were also hot and seasoned well with salt and pepper, seemingly before cooked.I will definitely be back to try more items on the menu! I'm very impressed considering I usually never order subs since a lot of places only offer plain, boring options like turkey. This place had so many options that I could never get tiredYoung workers there are also very friendly!"
"3.0","Stopped in for dinner for a bachelor party before going out. The food was average, nothing extraordinary. We ordered tatchos as an appetizer and they were the best part of the meal. I ordered the black and bleu burger and ordered it medium; it came out extra well done and was very dry. I ordered a bourbon smash and it came out in a tiny plastic cup. When I got it, the cup was only 3/4 of the way full and there was a ton of ice. What really was disappointing was they charged me $14 for a sub par drink!!The service was very slow. It took over an hour for our appetizers to come out (tatchos, quesadilla, and a buffalo chicken flatbread). We were at the restaurant for over 2.5 hours because it took another 50 minutes for our meals to come out after our appetizers. Very disappointing.I probably wouldn't return in the future, but if I did, I would try either the artery clogging fried cheeseburger or fried Italian hoagie."
"5.0","My boyfriend and I have went here for drinks several times but just recently tried their food.  I have always enjoyed their beer and cocktails, everything has been great!  For food, I ordered the burger and my boyfriend order a shrimp sandwich which kind of reminded him of a po boy.  We both loved our food!  The burger was one of the better burgers I've had in town and the fries were very good as well.  The service was great, the server was very accommodating to us being picky and asking for us substitutions for things. The ambiance is casual and and maybe you would call it the farmhouse look?  I enjoyed it.  We will definitely be back for food and drinks, can't wait to try their new location!"
"4.0","Completely stuffed and I'm not even 1/3 into my Pad Thai takeout.  They even packed a surprise dessert (sweet green bean soup)!"
"5.0","You will be surprised. Really not that expensive.Costs are very fair. Wine prices are unusually attractive, most under $40.00.What makes Ruth's Chris costly is your ordering drinks, several appetizers, larger steaks than you need, wine, side dishes, dessert and coffee.The 12 ounce fillet is a meal in itself. If you get a lot of side dishes, by the time you have a little of this, a little of that, your beef is cold. Don't be cheap, but be realistic. We were there for the beef. Excellent. Try Ruth's Chris. You will remember the steak for a long time. That's why you went. Enjoy!"
"5.0","Tram's is the best Pho I've had in Pittsburgh! The service is fast. Don't expect any small talk from your server. Just straight and too the point. I got the fried vegetarian spring rolls. They were great and bigger then most places. The dipping sauce was light and fresh. I got the beef pho. The broth was amazing! Hit the spot! This will be my new pho spot from now on!"
"5.0","Everything was excellent. I had blueberry pancakes my friend had a burger...it was all great. While waiting in line to order they gave us a table number and found us a table upstairs on the balcony. My new favorite place in the Strip."
"1.0","What is happening at this Chipotle!! They are almost always out of some important items in the menu. I once did not get Guac and I was absolutely incensed. The UPitt one is much much better. Pull up your socks Chipotle!"
"5.0","This is probably my favorite restaurant in PGH. Great ambiance. And you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I love the takoyaki and the spicy tuna onigiri, and the presentation of the food is just as good. The cocktail menu is great, too. I highly recommend!"
"3.0","Ordered the grilled cheese with crab - at least that is what I think I ordered, its not anywhere on their website menu. It had been good, but did not taste strongly of crab (which is why I now question it) and it had been very rich and heavy, with almost too much butter or oil or whatever it had been cooked in.The buffalo chicken rillettes were better, it was a buffalo chicken dip essentially, with bread and blue cheese. It packed a lot of punch in the small container it was served in.It was busy that night but the service was attentive, and while I dont drink beer, their selection seemed to be very wide and pleasing to all palates."
"5.0","We ordered boxed lunches and some afternoon snack platters from Sausalido for a small 100-person design conference. Delivery was early, and the quality was amazing. I took home some leftover veggies that I was still eating, just as fresh, a week later. Sausalido was professional and responsive, and offered amazing, healthy options at a reasonable price. The cheeses on the afternoon snack trays were to die for, and the boxed lunches were anything but boring. Everything was fresh and delicious. We were delighted to work with them and I can't wait to do so again."
"5.0","Went to Ki Ramen for my fiancé's birthday dinner. No reservations but not a problem on a Wednesday night. We sat on the top level by the kitchen which provided a really cool environment. We started with the cucumber snack and the fried cauliflower. Bother were outstanding and I'm going to try my best to copy the peanut sauce on the cauliflower on my own. I had the vegetarian curry ramen and added a 6 minute egg and chili paste, which provided the perfect amount of spice. He got the Shio Ramen, which he raved about and loved the crispy pig ears in the dish. Only complaint was service was lacking in some areas such as not getting water refills, utensils, etc. Food made up for it though so still gets 5 stars in my book. We will definitely be back!"
"4.0","The entrance is a little awkward as others have pointed out. It isn't clear how to enter and then once you enter, how to find the actual restaurant.Drinks were great. Excellent sake selection. The cocktails were on point. The Umami bar was very well done.Food was really good. We had ramen and robotayaki."
"3.0","I wanted to enjoy Cinderlands, I really did.  However, the food was simply sub-par.  We went during restaurant week and chose two different sandwiches, neither of which were particularly impressing.  We had the Banh Mi and the chicken parm, neither of which was particularly flavorful, and both of with I could have made much better at home.  We didn't even eat the leftovers.  The three stars is for the sweet potato fries, which were actually quite delicious.  The server was nice and the beer list is probably impressive if you are into beer, so maybe give this place a chance - but beware the sandwiches."
"5.0","Five Stars* 1st & foremost - Service.* Creativity in menu style & selection* Ambiance - cozy with good use of space* Accommodating to those with allergies* Great tasting food even for hardcore carnivoresThe party starts before we get there by shopping for thematic wines bottles to match the theme of the restaurant.  There's a nominal fee of $1 per bottle.   We've discovered some really interesting & delightful wines in the process.Twice we've visited with a large party of 10 or more making a reservation via email.  Each time Rose has provided exceptional service to our animated family.  Despite the constant chatter & confusion amongst us Rose serves us with ease, answering questions & being  very attentive to our wants, needs & food sensitivities.  The Chef was accommodating by creating a allergy free dish we've dubbed  'Lucy in the Sky'.  Ask for it, let's see if it catches on.  Despite being space challenged, our large group is intimately seated which is perfect for our close knit family & friends.Simply put, the food is off the chain, priced right & appealing to even hardcore carnivores.  With a large group we are able to order a variety of things & all are good.  Headbanger balls really good. The desserts are to die for.  Try the lavender roll. Yummy I'm wrapping it up now.  The merchandise is made of quality material & fun to wear.   I now own a long sleeve shirt, a 'Kale em all' t-shirt & a tote bag.  Other family members made various purchases as well.  This is now my favorite spot in the burg when I come home to visit.  I especially love that it's in my old stomping grounds."
"5.0","Ooohhh my gosh!!! We just passed by this place randomly, and we're shocked by how awesome this tea is!! They have a bunch of different options of loose leaf tea available, and they of course offer hot and iced teas. We got the blood orange tea lemonade as well as a peach apple coddler iced tea. THEY WERE SO GOOD!! I definitely recommend the peach and apple coddler, I'm probably coming back just to get this one again. The decor inside is very nice, and they even had a little game of tic tac toe you can play. It's really cute!Definitely recommend this place!"
"4.0","This is really good NY style pizza.  Thin crispy crust.  Go get a slice, it will take up 2 plates!"
"5.0","Brisket Hash is one of the best things to get anywhere for brunch in Pittsburgh.Great options and great food."
"5.0","We had a great time here on New Years Eve. Our server Autumn made the night so fun. She was very attentive and helpful. Her vibrant personality kept us laughing all night. The drink specials were fantastic and we loved the appetizers. We will be back soon."
"4.0","Best pizza in Oakland- more expensive than other places but definitely worth the extra money! I also love the garlic butter they give you with the pizza.....YUM!"
"4.0","I'd been wanting to try Stagioni for awhile and it didn't disappoint. There were 4 of us, and we decided to start with plenty of drinks and even more appetizers. We shared the: fresh mozzarella, roasted dates, beans & greens, eggplant involitini, and fried calamari. Everything was delicious, though the highlights were the fresh mozz, the tomato sauce in which the eggplant was served and the dates. THE. DATES! Probably the best thing of the night - sweet, salty, chewy and absolutely perfect; I would order them every time, and then again. By the time we finished the apps (champions of the appetizers, as our waitress noted LOL), we were verging on the cusp of being full, so for our 'meals' we ordered the: half portion of gnocchi, tomato soup, timpano, and polenta with octopus. As with the apps, everything was tasty with the exception of the polenta and octopus. It was pretty awful, as much as I hate to say it. I've heard good things about this dish, so I feel as though something went horribly wrong with the cookery. The octopus was charred beyond being edible... it tasted like it was doused in lighter fluid and thrown directly onto a hot flame. The polenta and sauce it came with were okay, however, I didn't love that it was served on a mini wooden cutting board. As the polenta sat there, it absorbed the flavor of the board, if you know what I mean... The last thing I'll comment on is the furniture. I'm such a stickler for comfortable restaurant chairs and these were less than ideal. Not only did they seem unsteady, they were just uncomfortable.  All in all, we had an enjoyable meal, our waitress was sweet, the prices were fair, and I would definitely go back."
"1.0","Literally 45 mins and still haven't gotten my food. Terrible service!! And haven't heard from our waiter since we got here.Update: food came at the 1 hour mark but still haven't heard from our waiter since we have been here. I may not fit in here but I'm a PAYING customer just like everyone else. This place is for snoods."
"3.0","I decided to try this place, because I heard people talk about it and I usually see people inside. Unfortunately, I won't be returning here. I tried the garlic soy sauce chicken which had good flavor, but I did not like the texture. I thought that I could rely on the fries, and yep that didn't happen. The fries were pretty bland. I did like the vibe of the place. It's small and intimate decorated in bright colors with K-Pop playing in the background. In short, the food just didn't tickle my fancy. I thought this place was pretty expensive before I even ate my food."
"1.0","I absolutely love Pamela's on Walnut St., but the remodel is TERRIBLE. My friends and I felt like we were sitting in a hospital cafeteria. Who did they hire to do this? It went from a cozy neighborhood breakfast spot to a room of sterile, tasteless, and tacky décor. Not to mention the construction and paint work is horribly done. Very, VERY disappointed. We will be looking for a new place for our weekend brunches. Dear Pamela's, PLEASE go back to the old décor!"
"5.0","Always the best place in town for fresh halal meat and delicious meals. Friendly staff and great prices."
"4.0","Let me first say I will try this place again because they have pride in what they create.  They are culinary artist, not cooks and it shows in the menu.  I will always give a place a second and third try if the passion shows and here it does.  Unfortunately, my meal was not as outstanding as I hoped, but still better than most.The chicken noodle soup was average, but in Pittsburgh we are spoiled (and I hate to admit it) with Eat n Park's chicken noodle.My chicken wrap cam with lettuce, lime aoli, bacon, and bbq sauce.  It was good, but the BBQ sauce either didn't fit with the rest or was missing that spicy tang I like in BBQ sauces.Thought the prices were slighly high for what you got."
"3.0","A-mazing chicken schwarma. The best. Their naan is also very good. Loved the cafeteria setting and enjoyed walking through the market.Only bad part: the parking lot beside the building is tight. Someone parked us in. Next time, I would look for street parking.Next time I go to Salem's I will be sampling the yummy looking middle eastern desserts."
"3.0","It was okay! The pho soup is a little salty than I expected. The rice noodles is broken, not continuous. It's still good if u never have authentic pho before. Try then fresh spring roll."
"3.0","1 major issue- Cash Only.  All in all the food was ok.  I have had a lot of Pho in my time.  I have eaten in most of the Vietnamese restaurants in the strip.  Menu is rather small.  Would like to have some other choices on the Pho.  Portions were good.  You do get a huge bowl of Pho.  Spring rolls were good.  Peanut sauce was just not as good as in some other places. But still a good spring roll."
"5.0","Bruegger's has always been one of my favorite sandwich stops, and this location is no different. The bagels and coffee are always fresh, the staff is always friendly and let me customize my sandwiches to my hearts desire, and now with the rewards app I can get free stuff!PSA: TRY THE SUNDRIED TOMATO SPREAD ON A BAGEL YOU WONT REGRET IT"
"5.0","First time at a Hello Bistro, and I loved it!! Great value for a CUSTOM salad, and everything was fresh and delicious. The staff members were all very friendly and nice, and I will definitely be back when travel brings me back to the area."
"5.0","After a long day at school on the North Side, I traveled my usual route back to the East on E. Ohio St. Traffic was unusually hectic so I had time to gaze around at my surroundings. That's when I noticed this large store front with a neat interior. I parked my car and walked into the coolest tea and coffee shop I've seen in Pittsburgh. Really sweet customer service and awesome interior. The teas were just as good. I ordered the Lavenade (lavender lemonade) and a green tea. Definitely will go back soon"
"5.0","Really great meal and excellent service! It was one of the best meals I've had in Pittsburgh in months. It was a packed house but the entire staff was patient and friendly. Highly recommend!!"
"5.0","Great wine, great atmosphere (granted the chairs in the dining section are a bit uncomfortable), great service. I ordered the pork tenderloin with pork belly, absolutely delicious, melted in my mouth, so many flavors but not overwhelming. I'm not a fan of lavender but I was pleasantly surprised by the lavender pound cake, not overpowering and very moist. Excellent wine. I look forward to returning."
"5.0","This place is great! We ordered takeout for the bourbon salmon, the superburger, and the zucchini lasagna. The salmon was delicious, and the lasagna was amazing. I've never had a vegetarian entree that tasted this good. Also, with the three entrees we got three free cookies and some sides. The cole slaw was just ok, but the garden rice and garden salads were phenomenal. I wish we stayed at the restaurant to eat because the diner vibe was really chill and warm. Definitely recommend this place to anyone staying at Days Inn or Comfort Inn because it's just a short walk away!"
"3.0","Had lunch here on Thursday and feel they could have done better.  The Calamari was delicious- light, fluffy and super tender.  The fries were pretty good but not great.  The fish (on the Fish & Chips) was a disappointment.  The fish was chunky & flakey but the batter wasn't fully cooked.  The outside was crispy but the layer between the crispy outer layer and the fish was still pasty & batter(y).  It needed cooked for another minute or two and it would have been delicious.  If I go again- I'll ask for my fish to be well done (can I actually do that?).  Here's a tip for you all- Join their Birthday club, you'll be glad you did!"
"5.0","Five stars for really friendly service and my sister's favorite milk tea bubble tea! We have a custom order, asking it to be blended like a frappe. Absolutely delicious! They also recognize us upon entering and already know our order. My mom got the mango bingsoo and was beyond satisfied. Love it here and will keep coming back plus recommending Chick'n Bubbly to friends!"
"4.0","Jimmy Johns is great.  It's fast, it's cheap, it's a chain, you can find them anywhere.  Reviewed just so they'd have a better than 3 star rating.  Also, I lost ~10lbs on the unwich diet this summer.  Subway has nothing on JJ's...  What's an unwich, you ask? Allow me to enlighten you.  It's lettuce subbed  in for the bread.  I made fun of people that ordered them.  Until I tried it.  Holy fat kid at skinny camp, these are good.  It's actually all I get when I go there now...It's ~400 calories of lettuce-wrapped delightfulness.  I go for the #11, unwich, add sprouts, cukes, oregano, hot peppers, ez mayo, ez dijon.  Other favorites are #8, #12, & #14.  You can't really go wrong here."
"5.0","A friend of mine has been talking this place up to the point where I decided to try it out today for lunch.  It couldn't have been more perfect for a Lenten Friday, because trust me, I did not miss out on the meat at all.  I asked for a salad plate with anything that the owner cared to give me, as it was my first time and I knew that I would want to try everything.  And boy, did he deliver.  I wish I could recall everything that I ate, but I consisted roughly of a bed of dressed salad, topped with hummus, baba ghanooj, beet salad, two types of tabbouleh (Middle Eastern and Turkish styles), something with carrots, tzatiki, and some spicy sauce that I will definitely be getting on ev-er-y-thing I order from there from now on.  That wasn't even everything they have on offer--I saw cucumber salad, dolmas, chickpeas, and a few other items too.  All of their cold sides, by the way, are not only vegetarian, but also vegan if you're looking for that as well.I'm SO satiated, but not sluggish.  My breath smells faintly of garlic, and I don't care.  If there was *anything* missing, it would have been great to have a piece of pita bread to sop up the salad from my container with.  Oh, and all of this was *very* reasonably priced.  I shall have to make this a regular takeout lunch spot.  Just keep in mind that they are cash only."
"4.0","Seeing as I am named Alexander I'm not surprised that a restaurant which shares my name is fantastic. I have eaten at Alexander's several times and the food and wait staff have always been spot on. My favorite dish is the Mafalda Alexander (Mafalda pasta, sausage, and a tomato cream sauce). They give you an un-eatably huge portion which is fine by me, it makes a great lunch the next day. Also, I think the decor and prices make this a great spot for a date night. One minor flaw is that the only parking is metered street parking. It's usually not a problem finding a spot relatively close, however I have run into issues in the past."
"2.0","Literally a lovely deck and view ruined by chain smokers. 90% of smokers don't want to sit there and get wafted in the face with clouds of smoke while they eat. We show up to 2  ashtrays on the table, one was full of buts, gum, and hair*gag*.  We were there for all you can eat crab legs. They were okay. It was dusk so bugs started coming out. We couldn't get the check quickly enough, we were dying to get away from the smoke and bugs."
"5.0","I've had the pleasure of dining at Thai Gourmet since 2007 but am just getting around to writing a review. I can't say enough good things about this place. The food is delicious, the portions are generous, the service is great, and the family running the place is about the nicest people around. My favorite dishes include the lotus salad, eggplant tofu, basil fried rice, Penang curry, and of course pad Thai. Honestly though, I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. The best Thai food in Pittsburgh. Love, love, love this place."
"1.0","Bad customer service.  The first time we were ignored so we left thinking maybe just a bad time.  The next night we had a large group of 10 and was rudely told cash only as soon as we walked in.  Seemed did not want our business so we went to Italian restaurant few doors down and spent $900 there instead."
"5.0","Jimmy and Will were amazing! They greeted us with wonderful champagne. They recommended the perfect wine to compliment our dinner. Their wine sommelier, Will, was excellent. He explained the wines in a way that he was both in elevated but understandable. The entire experience was wonderful."
"5.0","Check out the downtown location of this top patisserie in the 'Burgh (tied in my opinion with Jean Marc in Millvale).  It's better than Lawrenceville, because you don't have to line up as far, you get some additional lunch choices, like soups, and you can sit down to eat.  Otherwise, all the classics you expect.I went at a slow time and the service had a little more of a relaxed vibe."
"4.0","THE  CHARCUTERIE BOARD IS SO GOOD!!! Absolutely love it! We have gone and share it as a meal that's how delicious it is. Other things I like here? Just about everything! The Parmesan and pepper pizza is really good and I also really like the goat cheese ravioli. If you're going to the theater or looking to hang out with friends for dinner after work this is a nice choice for anyone who happens to be downtown.Never had a bad experience."
"2.0","They may have updated the resturant but every time I go there is always hair in my food. So, I usually get one of their pies and skip eating there."
"1.0","Head the 1 star. Lots of street kids in and out. Staff tries seems to be numb to it. They 'don't do refills here.'  Find somewhere else to eat..."
"5.0","Vastly exceeded our expectations! We had the shoyou ramen and the inferno ramen--both were incredibly delicious. Nice beer and wine selection as well and the servers were quick and attentive."
"5.0","Jaime is the most delightful bartender I've experienced in lawrenceville and I've lived 4 blocks away for the past 5 years! Always an enjoyable environment never a bad time"
"3.0","The ambiance of this place was outstanding. Lovely crowd, genuinely nice staff and good music. I ordered a slice of sausage. Pretty quick wait time. As far as the quality of the pizza, the sauce tastes like Spaghetti-O's, the sausage was very underwhelming and lacked flavor, the cheese was decent nothing special and the dough was pretty decent. Environment: 8.5/10Pizza: 5.6/10"
"3.0","Kiku has a 'go green' deal. If you buy your personal chopsticks for $5.00, thus saving trees,  you can save $1.00 each time you use them.   Big deal!  Have you seen some of the prices here?  And anyways, I always thought chopsticks were made out of bamboo, which is renewable.  That little rant aside, I was here last night for the first time in quite awhile.  A lot of the food here seems to be some version of teriyaki or tempura.  I'm not all that familiar with Japanese food, so I don't know if this is the norm.  Pittsburgh doesn't have very many Japanese restaurants to choose from.  But feeling a little adventurous, I tried the Unaju, which is grilled eel on a bed of rice with Kiku's own eel sauce.  Y'know, I'm glad I tried it 'cos it was really good.  All of their entrees come with their amazing miso soup.So why only a three-star rating?  It just seems that Kiku is a little pricey for what you get.  As another poster says, it's one of the few non-gigachain restaurants remaining in Station Square.  But even the lunch menu ain't all that cheaper."
"5.0","I have to update.  Since my last review I've tried 3 other dishes. Most recently the 1/4 fried chicken. Seasoned perfectly and the breast was succulent.   I've taken 10 additional people and they all loved it. Although parking is a challenge, I can usually find a spot on one of the side streets off Carson."
"4.0","Great beer selection with late night draft specials during the week.  They don't offer much for food outside of little plates, but the bruschetta was on point.  When it's warm out, the roof opens up and you can see a really pretty view of the skyline.  Parking can sometimes be tricky, but there's a garage and a lot a few blocks down.  I'll definitely be back when the weather warms up."
"1.0","Wtf? The hype got to their heads, because the obnoxious service got even more awful.  We made a reservation and were kept cooling our heels for an HOUR.  Hey. This is PITTSBURGH, friend.  It's Pittsburgh. At the end of the day, you're still in a third rate town. Lose the attitude.The food was mediocre.What a waste."
"5.0","Talk about an all around great restaurant ! My boyfriend and I are visiting from MD and decided to have lunch here because why pass it up??? Our server was fantastic as we never saw the bottom of our glasses!! THe periogie appetizer was to die for and our meals were just as great. Highly recommend sitting outside on a nice day!"
"3.0","Good food, decent portion size but pricey.  Great atmosphere.  Beware that they DO NOT accept cash."
"5.0","Amazing burgers, cozy modern atmosphere, and great service! Can't ask for much more out of a burger joint...but wait....try the fried chicken, best in the Pittsburgh metro that I've had. Good beer and drink selection rounds out a great place to enjoy friends and a meal!"
"5.0","Solid Bloomfield spot, great food, and good service too. I'm happy to come here occasionally for a decent meal."
"4.0","Small storefront style building. Standing room only bar.Outstanding service. Interesting and flavorful selection of foods. The tapas are small plates and not really enough to share. They are delivered quickly, so dinner is easily done in 1-1.5 hours. The cocktail and wine selection is small, but those that are offered are very good. Two observations worth mentioning are that there very few seafood items on the menu and they need to improve the air conditioning."
"5.0","My husband, seven month old daughter, and two friends met at Cinderlands in March and had a fantastic experience! Though the entrance is small and assuming, the interior is beautifully updated in an industrial aesthetic and twice as large as I had anticipated. I was skeptical about taking my infant, and she was initially the first child in the restaurant. However, (thankfully) she was well behaved, and eventually, one or two other children arrived as well.The beers were literally made for us! My friend and I love Belgians, and there were two delicious Belgian offerings on the menu that weekend. I also enjoyed trying a rich stout and a crisp pale ale (which I loved, though I normally dislike that style). Everything that we ordered hit the spot!The food delivered as well. We ordered a number of things including the Marcona Almonds, Pierogies, Scotch Egg, and Brussel Sprouts. The Scotch Egg was definitely the table's favorite dish, and we inhaled the two that we ordered.I had a fantastic experience at Cinderlands and can't wait to return in the future! Do keep in mind that the menu -- particularly the beers -- change frequently, so have an open mind every time that you come here."
"5.0","In Pittsburgh and craving a burger this is the place to go. Farm to table excellence! We went with the Maggie's Farm and Morningside. Both cooked to order and perfection! The rosemary and fresh cut fries are well worth it too. Highly recommend and they serve veggie options as well. We will definitely return on our next trip to Pittsburgh."
"2.0","Here's the deal. The food is good. Rialto rolls are bangin. Here's the problem. They are one of the most expensive places around. Comparatively speaking. Seems like every couple months the portions get smaller, and the prices go up. The sicillian shrunk by half the size, and price stayed the same. When times are tough, this place will break you. Conicellos pizza has replaced them for my tastes."
"5.0","I work close to here so we get pizza from here pretty often. It's always pretty tasty and comes at a good price. Never a complaint."
"5.0","Fantastic.  Got the Whiz with extra fried sweet peppers.  Son got a plain steak. Both were great. Best cheese fries. Fresh cut crispy and Cheesy.  The guys behind the counter are always very nice."
"4.0","Overall, I'm a fan. The atmosphere is so trendy and lush, and the place was bumping even on a Sunday night. The menu was relatively small, which I liked. Some of the options include tenders, a sandwich, salad, or chicken and waffles. I opted for the chicken tenders with a side of fries and a drink. I went with the mild seasoning but there's multiple heat levels to tantalize all taste buds. In my opinion, the seasoning was pretty salty; but I don't typically over-season my food. The crinkle cut fries were just what I needed, though! CHiKN also has what appears to be a full bar, which was unexpected. After ordering, we were given a buzzer for our order. Whenever you choose your table, you dock the buzzer in the center, and it allows the food runner to locate you. Super cool!"
"5.0","Incredible food. We came without a reservation and they were SO courteous to us still with the wait time. Everyone there seemed like regulars and the owner seemed to know everyone and was personable; he even asked us how our food was. Get the crab cake risotto!!!"
"5.0","My husband and I drove up from Va to Pa with friends for the Pittsburgh vs Browns game 12/1/2019. My husband is 62, been a fan all his life and never been to a home game. His friend the same. He and his wife were celebrating their 40th wedding anniversary.  We went downtown to find the stadium. We also stumbled on this restaurant. We figured that a resturant with Jerome Betis name has to be good. We were not disappointed. The food and service were great! George was our server and he treated us like royalty. We heard that the carrot cake was Jerome's mother's recipe. She must be an awesome cook. That slice of cake was enough to feed several people and the best carrot cake we have ever tasted.......and I'm a southern cook. Wish I could meet Mother Betis and watch her make her world class carrot cake. Anyway, this was a weekend we will always remember...close friends, good food, and the Steelers won! This was the best road trip ever!"
"1.0","not be overdramatic but the hot chicken tenders gave me ulcer-level stomach pains. also, the fries tasted like cardboard and the coleslaw was dry and mediocre."
"1.0","Came to pittsburgh for the first time and had to check out bettis' restaurant. We had a party of 13 and waited 3 hours before even getting seated. After we ordered our food it took about 45 minutes for 2 entrees to come out. The rest of us had to watch them eat. Then they told us the food was coming right out(a half hour later), they proceeded to bring only 4 more entrees out and again the rest of us were stuck sitting, watching them eat. This night turned into a disaster and as much as we love Jerome bettis this restaurant is run very poorly and we will not be returning."
"3.0","Bland and boring, but sometimes that's what you want.  The bread here is supposed to be baked fresh, but I've had it be hard and stale before.  The signs advertising 'free smells' are kind of useless- there is nothing inside baking or cooking to smell good.  Choice of bread is a french bread, a multi-grain (which is actually higher in calories) and lettuce-wrap type deal.  Cheese does not come standard on the sandwiches unless specifically indicated- otherwise it is an upcharge, which seems slighty ridiculous.  The choices are limited- no grilled chicken, for instance.  You can upgrade to a meal by adding chips and a drink.  Beware, even the 'Thinny Chips' pack 260 calories (the website says 130, but that's for a serving.  The bag contains 260 calories worth- who eats 1/2 of an individual serving of chips).On the plus side, it is super quick and the people are polite and friendly. They deliver, too."
"5.0","This place is a true north side establishment and that's why I love it.  It's raw.  You will wait while trying to place an order on the phone and upon arrival, however the pizza is the best bang for your buck! It's not the best pizza in Pittsburgh, but it is nice for the north siders who are trying to get their grub on- cheap!!  Pizza is def dee-licious , but not Rt.51 good!"
"3.0","Fab food, so-so service. In fact, there's favoritism shown in seating parties of the same size. Waited 50 mins while 3 parties, known to the hostess, were seated ahead of us. Only real downer of the experience, but we won't return."
"4.0","I really like this place. I have gone there several times and the food on the restaurant side of the store is always fresh and good. The last time there I had the hummus (best in the burg) and spinach pie. Also had the chick pea salad , yummm! In the past I have had the chicken kabab, and kind of a chickpea stew served over rice. It is done steam table style so you can look over the food before you buy so you can try different things. Try the goat meat it's really good. The decor is like a cafeteria, so fancy it's not. The prices aren't fancy either. Two can eat for about $20, including a piece of baklava for dessert..If just rating the food I would give it 5 stars"
"4.0","This is a go-to spot for a friend and me. It's a little on the pricey side, their menu isn't anything too exciting, the selection is sorta limited and doesn't seem to change ever, but I've really enjoyed everything I've tried there so far. Their happy hour beer and appetizer specials are again pretty limited but always satisfying and decently priced. I wish they had a touch more variety in food but I'll be back nonetheless and definitely recommend."
"5.0","This was a great experience, my wife and I loved the food and the atmosphere. The service was good nothing amazing, but it was perfectly adequate. Overall would highly recommend."
"5.0","Great little spot with great food. All exterior walls are garage doors and they were open today so it was great. Food - we just got some apps. Fries, chicken bean dip, and tacos. All were really good, quality dishes. We really enjoyed it. Drinks - the cocktails were awesome. The bartenders do a great job and are definitely experienced at making some awesome drinks. The Penicillin is amazing. Bartenders - nice guys. Interacted with guests and made sure everyone was taken care of. We got extra chips without asking. Overall, awesome spot. Highly recommend."
"5.0","I hit up Cafe Raymond for Brunch on Saturday morning. Since I hasn't been before, I wasn't sure what to expect, but it has great reviews so I was excited to try it. I hadn't realized that you order your food and then get seated at a table. Luckily, I had looked up what I wanted to order, so I didn't have to hold up the line. The line was pretty long around 11:30am. But there were tables available and they had the patio open upstairs. I ordered an omelette- you can pick up to 3 add-ins for your omelette. The omelettes come with a side of potatoes. I added bacon, cheddar cheese, and mushrooms. The omelette was delicious! It was full of toppings and was a great size for the price. The potatoes were a little spicy, but with a little Heinz ketchup- they were great. I also split an order of lemon ricotta pancakes - they were wonderful. I definitely can understand why everyone likes them. They weren't the best pancakes I've ever had, but they were very good. I would definitely order them again or try the French toast next time. Overall, I loved my experience at Cafe Raymond and will be back again soon!"
"5.0","I can't say enough good things about Thai Gourmet. It is the freshest, most delicious Thai food I've ever tasted. Family-run and comfortable, the waitresses have literally said things like, 'My mom's cooking today, she makes it really spicy, just so you know...' And they will actually make your food spicy. If you order a 10, damn sure it will be a TEN. The lunch special is the best deal in the city. For around $7, you will get a spring roll, amazing lemongrass or wonton soup, plus your invariably gigantic entree. I have actually taken leftovers from lunch, which I honestly don't think has ever happened before. The Nam Prik is my favorite: a bowl of saucy, spicy, peanutty (?) chicken, with noodles, tempura vegetables, and lettuce on the side. The basil chicken, pad see ew, and prik king are not to be missed. Even the General Tso is wonderfully unique. Plus, your food comes really quickly, which I appreciate at lunch."
"2.0","We stopped at Crust Almighty because of the reviews we read online.....WELL..this was in NO WAY the best pizza I've ever tasted. It was greasy, the sauce and cheese did not have any special characteristics that would make me say WOW! I will not be visiting this pizza shop again. I will stick to my BEST GO TO PIZZA....MINEOS!!!!"
"2.0","6-12 minute wait was actually over 35 minutes.Good food....just not an accurate wait time by any means !"
"5.0","This is a wonderful hidden gem in South Side. The food is creative and expertly prepared. They also have creative cocktails and affordable wines. It's a great place for a casual dinner or a special occasion!"
"5.0","Wow. From the coffee to the Green Apple , Brie and Fig Challah French toast and the meat filled omelet my wife got everything was fresh and fantastic"
"1.0","I sent my parents here for their 37th wedding anniversary dinner a few nights ago.  They came with a gift card that, for some reason, didn't work.  The gift card is good and I was just re-issued the card by darden.  Instead of trying to solve the issue and figure out a solution, the manager berated my parents and embarassed them in front of guests, showing a complete lack of class.  There are a lot of good steakhouses in Pittsburgh - spend your money somewhere that treats patrons with a bit more respect than this place."
"1.0","I've eaten at Alexander's for a decade, but, like Del's, it's becoming one of those places where the food gets worse every time you go there.  Today, half the lettuce I had on my Caesar salad was rotten.  I have no idea why it ever left the kitchen.  And it was take-out, too, so there wasn't much I could do about it after driving all the way home.  (They gave me the wrong entrée too, but at least it was edible.)I finally think I'm done with this place."
"4.0","Finally. I've found awesome Indian food in Pittsburgh. And it's within crawling distance of my apartment. And they're open for reasonable hours. I really am kicking myself for being a chicken and not trying it sooner. It tastes like home cooking made with quality ingredients and love. Got the Chicken Biryani and there was enough for three more meals. I went back and got bread and some extra cucumber sauce. Looking forward to trying everything. The burgers (made with Halal meat) looked gorgeous. Would give it 5 stars but the ordering process is a bit chaotic. There's definitely a learning curve for the newbie. But it's well worth it."
"3.0","This place used to be the only fine dining establishment in good 'ol Bloomfield.  I've been here a few times.  Apparently the food has booze in it, because I can't even remember what I ordered.  I don't remember being disappointed.  But yeah...I think this suffers a bit from the lack of uniqueness.  Now, overly unique can be just as damning of a quality as unoriginal, but forgettable may be the worst quality a restaurant can have.  I do remember relatively slow and subpar service last time I was there, even though we were the only party there.  Our waitress was texting with the vigor of a middle school student whose parents didn't quite pay attention to them enough (because Dad had to work long hours and now it's time to passive aggressively stick it to him by dating a 17 year old 'bad boy' with an abnormal amount of facial hair).  Anyways, they'll have to do something if they wanna stay relevant.  IF THIS RESTAURANT WERE A MUSICIAN/BAND: Grand Funk Railroad:  You can't remember anything they ever did, and you never will have a strong opinion about them, despite not having any sort of strong reputation as good or bad.  You only know they existed."
"4.0","Vegans needn't be the only one patronizing this establishment! It's a delicious spot for anyone to eat at. I had this spot on my list for a while now, but hadn't made the trek up to Allentown. It's a fairly small restaurant, with only a handful of seats, but during brunch on a Saturday we sat right down with no wait. The brunch menu has all the faves like waffles, bagels (from Pigeon Bagel) and grits. I ordered the grits and for an up-charge of $2 added the tots and a kale salad. The grits were good. I would have added a tad more salt and pepper and I think they would have been perfect. The grits alone with out adding the tots and salad would have been a pretty small portion for brunch, so I'm glad I added them. My only note, not really a complaint, is to educate the servers a little bit more on what is gluten free and what isn't. I came here because I knew they had a handful of GF options. I was happy to see that the menu noted what was GF. I confirmed with the server that the grits were definitely gluten free. We had a whole discussion about GF options and there was no hesitation on her part as I ordered the tots and salad. But I should have been more careful and asked about the side dishes, specifically what dressing was on the kale salad (it wasn't listed on the menu). Totally my fault. I took one bite and realized there was soy in the kale salad dressing. The server and chef were nice enough to make me another salad with a delicious white wine dressing instead. Again, totally my bad for assuming and now I know to just double check here! Regardless, great visit and I will be back!"
"5.0","This place is great. A group of friends and I went here for dinner and were impressed both by the food and the atmosphere. It has a quaint feeling initially, but tables are spaced well so that you maintain some privacy. The food is spectacular. You can tell that it's all hand-crafted and a lot of thought goes into the flavors on the menu as well as the presentation of each dish. I'd recommend a particular dish, but we ordered pretty much everything on the menu and didn't have anything that disappointed us. You can't go wrong. I asked our server for his recommendations several time and he was quick to point out promising results. I'm vegan and went with three other friends who weren't -- each of us left satisfied and very pleased with our meals. I am definitely looking forward to returning in the future!"
"4.0","I was staying at a hotel in downtown Pittsburg and the restaurant was closed, so I was handed a pamphlet to Genoa. I ordered the spinach chicken pizza in medium. They said I would have to come downstairs to get it but they ended up delivering to my room which was awesome. Delivery guy was very nice asked several times if i needed anything else. I had looked this place up on yelp after ordering and was a little weary after seeing reviews. However! I was pleasantly surprised. I judge a pizza by if i want to eat the crust or not. Let's just say I ate it all (not in one sitting ) but the toppings were packed on and the flavor was great. The side of ranch it came with was really tasty as well. I just re-heated some pieces for lunch today and it was still just as good. The portion to price ratio was very reasonable. I would totally order from here again."
"3.0","My husband and I went on a weekday at 5pm so it wasn't busy at all. The service was extremely slow and the waitress didn't check on us or explain why the food was taking so long. After finishing our appetizer we had ordered it again because it was really good. After the second appetizer our entrees still hadn't come. We probably were there for an hour and a half. Most of it spent on waiting. Food was good but service was meh."
"5.0","Coming from a place where beef is king, I am usually weary of establishments that do their own blends of burgers. Usually you can sort of identify the taste or concept they are going for, but rarely does it actually amount to something great. In this case it was perfect. I had the fox chapel burger and the flavor profiles were absolutely amazing. Even the salad was excellent. Although a little pricey, it is well worth it for the level of burger craft that goes on here, easily my favorite burger in Pittsburgh in terms of flavor. The beers were also excellent and reasonably priced, I will definitely be back to try more Burgh'ers soon!"
"2.0","Hello Bistro is a great idea. The quality is slightly better than your standard fast food fare, the prices aren't too bad for a regular lunch spot (although $10-12 for a salad that won't fill you up can really add up if you go on a regular basis), and the staff is usually nice.Where this location falters compared to other locations is in consistency and order accuracy. Perhaps it's the INSANE lunch rush, but ordering ahead will result in an inaccurate order 90% of the time. Literally. My wife has almost never received an accurate order when ordering ahead. Breakfast, lunch? It doesn't seem to matter. They can't get it right. Unfortunately, unless you're looking to spend half of your lunch break in the crazy line, ordering ahead (and the possibility of doing so) is the way to go. Or, like we end up doing most of the time...we simply avoid this Hello Bistro altogether.I would love to see this location work out the kinks, as being a locally-owned and operated chain is always great to support, but for the price and quality, the inability to get orders correct will likely drive some people away. Fortunately for Hello Bistro, the lines hint that they won't struggle, regardless of service quality...which means they won't need a reason to improve."
"1.0","Stopped in for brunch this Sunday. We came in the front door and waited to be seated. One of the waitresses who seemed very annoyed waved us over and her eyes practically rolled back in her head. They sat us at a table in the back and there was one glass of water on the table and they brought over one fresh glass and set it in front of me. I asked if the water on the table was left from a previous table and the same rude waitress rolled her eyes again and said 'um we preset the tables'. We decided we didn't want to give them our business. You've been open for half an hour and there are many tables open, you aren't in the weeds and you haven't just worked a crazy brunch shift yet. It's a little early in the game to be that rude."
"3.0","First, notice this little place has an application for liquor license on the door.  Just what this area needs, another liquor license!  Did not realize that Gennaro's had such a large menu.  Lots of pasta, sandwiches, salads...not sure how such a small place can have such an extensive menu, but I digressed.  The pizza sauce has herbal favors to go with the cheese on a thinner crust that was toasted just right on the bottom.  Also, the menu has deep dish pizza."
"3.0","It was a Friday night, so a lot of the restaurants we tried had long wait times but we were seated right away at Redbeard's. We ordered the salmon croquettes and pretzel sticks for appetizers. The salmon croquettes were dry and were really lacking in flavor, so I could only eat it after spreading the queso sauce on top that we got with our pretzel sticks to make them more bearable. That was the first croquette. The second one tasted weird, like a chicken nugget. The pretzel sticks were warm and the queso dip was a good choice to go along with it. I wish they didn't have as much salt on them though. I ordered the Early Tee Time burger, which comes topped with a fried egg, crispy bacon, American cheese, and mayo and a side of steak fries. It was a pretty average burger; I've had much better burgers with egg and bacon. Friends ordered the fish & chips and the garden salad and both more or less enjoyed them.Taste | 2Atmosphere | 3Presentation | 3Service | 3OVERALL | 3"
"5.0","Damn - was that a good sandwich. The bread is soft, and chewy. There is a large variety of sandwiches to you will surely find something for yourself. Subs are served cold or hot. With your choice of topics and sauce. Cash only, so come prepared."
"4.0","Loved CHiKN! Went with a friend on a Friday night around 9 and they were still busy. It's a fast casual restaurant so you order at the counter and they bring you your food. They also have a full bar and can make you drinks when you order. This must be new, because when I ordered a vodka soda the waitress looked at me like I had 4 eyes. All good though, it's a new restaurant I expect the quirks. The food was good, I had a medium chicken sandwich and the chicken was perfect! The fries on the side however were a bit bland. Ambiance was fun and music was bumping, I'll be back!"
"5.0","Amazing atmosphere and food!  Don't miss the amber jack sashimi and the pork gyoza! Service was awesome and we've been telling all our friends about it ever since. Cannot wait to go back!"
"5.0","From out of town and feel lucky to have decided on Subba. The Chicken with Vegetable Nepalese style is fantastic."
"3.0","This place needs renovation big time. Chai was tooo sweet! They brought a replacement on my request but I think it's pre-made,so I couldn't do much with it. My Samosa Chat wasn't great. I'll check it out again for a larger order."
"5.0","Came here for a belated Valentine's dinner. It's very crowded, but the friendly service and mood lighting made it feel quite cozy. Call ahead and put yourself on the priority seating list, if possible! While many people waited in the foyer, we were seated immediately. For reference, it was 6:30pm on a Friday.There are plenty of vegetarian options, and I settled on the risotto, which is cauliflower-themed this time of year.  Loved it! The texture of the rice was perfect, with mellow-sweet cauliflower and toasted pine nuts. There was a balsamic reduction on top that took it to the next level for me - it's rare to find a meatless risotto that achieves such complexity. The salad and bread that come with every meal were also good.Instead of wine, we had cocktails - I went with the Nerina as I was feeling adventurous. A high-level craft cocktail worth its price, especially if you like bitter flavors.Will definitely return for another special occasion!"
"1.0","came here for a lunch buffet, and i am a huge fan of indian food. Friend took me to one in squirrel hill and it was delicious but this was not the case here at tamarind.  I live right down the street at the king edward and was hoping this place would be a gem. Okay.. i tried i really really TRIED to like this place but when your chicken tikka masala is the ONLY dish i'd consider borderline acceptable during a lunch buffet, that's a problem. c'mon its chicken tikka masala. make the chicken tender and the sauce takes care of itself. this felt like chewing rubber with a side of gravel. the one star is there for the excellent service. who was also nice enough to leave his name, Martin (standup fellow) and number (i wouldn't be so cruel) on a napkin for our friend because she was cute as hell"
"5.0","Probably one of the best meals that I have had in a long time.  Amazing Tuscan shrimp scampi with oil, garlic and lemon sauce.  Captain crunch roll was equally as good.  I can't wait to go back and to top it off our waiter, Nick was superb.  Swordfish = out of this world too."
"3.0","Fast service on a Saturday morning. Maybe I'm spoiled by New York, but the bagels are kind of small. They ran out of everything and cinnamon sugar bagels when we were there. They need a number system with receipts - people were grabbing wrong orders and it was chaotic. Coffee is average. Staff was half friendly / half rude"
"5.0","Great addition to the Southside. We went there for happy hour, and despite being empty the place was amazing. Our service, food and drinks were fantastic.We enjoyed the happy hour menu which included $4 drafts and $6 specialty drinks. With the server's help we were able to pick out two dishes that we really loved. We asked for a little assistance and she was able to tell us about all the things on the menu and what her favorites were.The huarache is a delicious flatbread with plenty of flavor. We also had the Arancini, rice balls with great tasting sauce and shredded parm. It looks like a small plate but fills you right up!We looked at the desserts but were plenty full from the food....we hope to go back for desserts and drinks soon!A great place for locals and tourists, since the tables are named after south side streets. We sat 'on Sarah Street' and love the view to Carson while enjoying our meal."
"2.0","I just paid $30 for a gristle-y skirt steak garnished with mayo and deep-fried cauliflower.The staff were great, but the food was seriously underwhelming. Just go to Butcher in the Rye.Maybe just come here for drinks."
"5.0","I eat lunch here at least once a week, I am never disappointed with the food quality, the portions or the price. One of my favorite places to eat. Staff is always polite and friendly. Highly recommend."
"4.0","I've gotten pizza from here twice and it's been consistently good. The crust is thinner than your typical Pittsburgh pizza and it's a little chewy. Since I'm a fan of thin-crust, I thought it was great! The sauce is a little tangy, a little sweet and not at all chunky. My favorite thing about this pizza was definitely the cheese...I loved the flavor and the consistency. This is my new go-to pizza place! It's convenient (they deliver) and it is also reasonably priced."
"4.0","Great late night sushi spot with interesting atmosphere.  There was a DJ the night we were there, which was cool, but not conducive to conversation.  The fish was fresh and expertly prepared/presented.  Will definitely be back!"

"3.0","I finally received a call today after my complaint on Friday night that I had submitted online with Primanti Bros... the lady could not have been nicer and more apologetic about the incident understanding my dietary restrictions.  She said she will mail me some gift cards (totally unexpected).  Once they arrive, and I go to a Primati's and use them on a Sandwich with NO CHEESE, I may update this even again!"
"5.0","It's not easy to give any place 5 stars  but this was easy. Great food, great service and a real feel of community. If you don't know what to order just ask. The portions are very generous with meats not just rice. One meal can feed 2 people but you won't want to share. A couple of must trys the Lamb Chops make sure you order at least three and the ground chicken burger you will get a second order to go..."
"5.0","Yinz goin dahn to Sammy's for corned beef sammich n'at? The answer to this question should always be yes. Sammy's may not be the nicest bar, but its a very Pittsburgh bar. If you know that is a compliment then this is the place for you. Tender meat on local bread is not a good enough discription. I love Sammy's, its a pick me up after a hard day. The meat, cheese, and bread sorta meld together to become a smooth buttery burst of flavor.  I suggest 'the special half and half Pittsburgh style with everything on marble rye and a potatoe salad' half corned beef half pastrami  with thousand island dressing 'pittsburgh style' means with Cole slaw on top comes with a pickle . The potatoe salad is nothing special but it completes the meal. The beer is cheap with an ipa on tap for 3.50 so drinking suggested. The only suggestion I have is get some Turners tea up in this place!"
"4.0","This is a super cute, super tiny store. Almost like a newsstand moved indoors without all of the newspapers. Though they do sell them here as well as lottery, breakfast sandwiches, donuts, soda, candy, coffee, etc.Justin, the owner is very nice and friendly. Prices are comparable to other types of stores in the downtown area.Located on the lobby entrance of the Mitchell Building just to the left if you're on Ross Street standing in front of the structure."
"5.0","Love this place! Lynn the bartender is awesome and a true yinzer if i ever Met one! The buffalo chicken dip is amazing and the dessert of the day always is as well!"
"5.0","Great Cafe, food is very good. My daughter starts working her soon. Diane was very friendly and helpful. Highly recommend."
"4.0","Good spot with divey decent food and drinks. The accompanying stage provides some opportunities to experience Pittsburgh comedy and song.  Sometimes it's good.  Sometimes it's tragic."
"5.0","Excellent pastas. Pink snapper was very good.   The stars were the appetizers, esp. the Beans and Greens (deep savory flavor with bitterness from the greens).Was surprised we hadn't heard of this place till very recently.  Will be back, both to try the brunch + again for dinner.  Reasonable prices + BYOB makes this affordable for the best Italian food we've had in Pittsburgh."
"1.0","NEW OWNER, NEW MANAGEMENT, NEW CHEF:  IT'S *HORRIBLE* NOW   :(they seem like nice people, however, this place changed management/ownership about 9 months ago (around January 2019)...the reviews in chronological order show the decline after transition:the previous chef no longer works there.  the current service is fine, but i really only care about FOOD - & other than good chai tea - this place now HORRIBLE because the food tastes bad.  even the *rice* is bad (it's like Uncle Ben's, not like authentic Indian rice).it's ridiculous how that with new ownership/chef, this place went from one of the best Indian restaurants in the Pittsburgh area to one of the WORST.  it's unfortunate & i'm disappointed because I was looking forward to giving them a chance since i used to go to the old place often when it was under the prior ownership/chef....therefore, i'm sorry for this poor review (the new people do seem very nice), but their chef & food is just *NOT* good.  I've been to all of the Indian restaurants in the south western Pennsylvania area (there are about 8 or 9 restaurants in total) & this is now unfortunately one of the worst with regards to food taste.  however, they have do very good chai tea."
"1.0","Based purely on customer service, can't say much about the food. Yelp stated they're open but their small sign in the corner stated different hours of operation. Before I noticed it though, I was in line, as the staff walked by and chuckled and not having the common courtesy of telling anyone they weren't open yet. You could already tell the staff were people that would find pleasure from such a trivial thing."
"1.0","My first experience with Rialto was unimpressive at best. I felt I way overpaid for a pizza that stood apart from no other toss n bake pizza. My second experience was better. I still paid a premium (nearly twice a competitors price) for an Italian hoagie. The hoagie impressed me so I figured this would just be an occasional hoagie fix foir me. Until today. Today I decided to gain back twice the calories I dumped on my bicycle ride. I stopped in and the A/C was nice so I decided to eat in. I ordered an Italian hoagie again, no tomatoes (I'm allergic). I was told 5 minutes and had a seat. Now there was an older man there eating a pie. I casually noticed he was eyeballing me. a few moments later he sauntered right past me and interrupted a table full of patrons as if he knew them. He began asking a young woman about her bag insisting he wanted a bag just like it (I think it was her purse). He carried on and on while they listened with puzzled facial expressions. I could tell they were uncomfortable. Other patrons took notice as well. He concluded by introducing himself by name and informing the woman that if she didn't want her bag, he would take it. Now i'm sure this man is harmless. Probably a regular from the neighborhood who just needs social interaction but lost his social skills during a tragic fall. The place probably even has a nickname for him. None the less I determined I would just take my order to go now and hopefully before he got to my table. Until it was placed in front of me. It had tomatoes. I explained I asked for no tomatoes. The man looked at the receipt, looked at the hoagie, and went through the motions of a mental conflict of what to do next. He explained 'I'll just throw this away and make you a new one'. I said i'd like it to go now. He left the hoagie and started walking away. He did a double take, asked me what I wanted him to do as if we didn't just discuss it. I explained, i'll take a new one; to go. Precisely 120 seconds later a bag fell onto the table and a 'sorry about that sir' was murmured out of left field. No way this was a fresh hot hoagie. If you want to take it to the back, pick the tomatoes off, toss it in the oven for 60 seconds and dump it back in front of me you might consider allergens. The food is tainted now and a greater liability to your business than the loss of a hoagie. You also lost a customer. I don't like waste. But food restrictions are food restrictions. I would have picked them off myself if it was ok to do so. The receipt says 'no tomatoe' in red. You screwed up, you eat it. Further you shouldn't allow patrons to wander about table to table and harass other patrons. To think I spent money on that experience. Never again."
"1.0","I have no idea where to start with this visit . The waitress  seemed very confused and didnt mention specials  til we decided to order but hey whatever. Me and a guest started by ordering the lobster fries ( which were decent  )  then we ordered our entrees i had to tell the waitress i wanted my steak medium as she never asked and walked away. My guest got a chicken salad and I ordered the land and sea with the add on lobster tail.   A guy brought out our food and we never saw the waitress for a good 20 minutes so i was unable to inform her my steak came out well done ( tough and no pink at all )  so once the waitress does come over i inform her and she says i will take care of it .    About 10 minutes after me and my guest notice a man walking in from outside with clothing from a dry cleaners?  And he looks around then slowly walks to my table and says whats the matter?    Stunned as to who he is, i said my steak was cooked in connectly. He says he is sorry to hear and it will be taken care of and to please try them again he is the owners father , so i figured okay things will be fixed no problem.   So the manager/ chef who brought our food out comes over and says what seems to be the issue i explained the steak situation and was confused why i would pay $45 for a steak he says oh you didn't eat it?  ( must not be any communication)  so he says he will remove it, returns and only $25 was credited? At this point ive been done eating for nearly 40 minutes so i just pay for my bill and want to leave. As im walking outside the older gentleman approaches me and says was everything taken care of ( is there any communication is this place ? )   i explained not to my liking and he seems shocked and i tell him i eat out at many place quite a bit and he assures me he is sorry and to come back in and it will be all fixed this time because a life long customer is worth $22,000 .   I walk back in ( big mistake)  so the manager/ cook guy says what seems to be the problem, i explian my situation with the steak again and he says sir i cooked your steak it was cooked to 140degress and it was pink .   I question how it was pink if you didn't cut into it nor did you see the steak after i was served it? He said that my 3 pieces of shrimp and potatoes were worth the $20 that was not refunded and theres nothing else he can offer except dessert which he did offer initially. I decided to leave.My question is who is this guy that approaches me at a restaurant he doesn't even work at and why did he try to help more then the staff?  I've read of atleast 1 of this exact experience with this guy...Weird!"
"4.0","Visiting Pittsburgh and was looking for a cute, local place to stop for coffee and breakfast for my family of 6.  This place was perfect.  The food was good, perfectly priced and my children were welcome.  Highly recommend for a local, family friendly breakfast.  And the coffee was delicious!"
"4.0","This is a really great place as far as lunch in concerned. Their lunch menu is revamped and is really the best you could get, where every entree is composed of two-three different food items. The service is usually good. You should surely give it a try!Any combination lunch which has 'Butter Chicken' would be great !"
"4.0","I walked into the office this morning (with slight post-Super Bowl haze) and quickly realized that it was my turn to bring in breakfast.  D'OH!   Panic mode.  The good folks at Bruegger's on the Southside helped me to recover with an amazing quick turnaround after my high-speed jaunt across the Birmingham Bridge.  Excellent bagels and some other options like muffins, cookies, great sandwiches and more.  I love the fact that these bagels taste like 'real bagels' compared to Panera.  I also love the fact that they have Smoked Salmon cream cheese (even though I might be in the minority on that one)!   Thanks Bruegger's - I got hammered and harrassed by co-workers but it could have been worse."
"4.0","Downtown Pittsburgh is deserted at night, especially on this street.  I was asked if I needed help with directions by a well-dressed stranger steps before entering into Sammy's with my suitcase.  That was sweet.I got off the Amtrak train during the evening and was wandering around the area looking for a quick eat.  Qdoba was closed.  Originally, my plan was to eat here and then head to my hotel but I changed my order into a take-out.  Although only a few seats were occupied, the atmosphere was very heavy and intense.  It was a little too quiet for me.  I felt like I was in a saloon with a fight about to break out any minute.  I walked to the sandwich counter at the back of the bar and ordered the special.  The woman was friendly although she didn't seem to be up for much conversation.  For less than $10 (~$8?), I got a pastrami sandwich on rye with cole slaw on the beef and a pickle on the side.  Damn, the cole slaw was light and the pastrami was very tender and chewy!  I devoured the whole thing.  Definitely worth a trip to Sammy's for this sandwich!"
"5.0","Haven't eaten here yet, but I did want to mention that they do take reservations.  According to the yelp page, they do not."
"4.0","Got so excited from all the reviews here so I obviously had to order three different entrees. Stuffed myself happy and didn't need to eat anything else for the rest of the day.Ordered:-butternut squash risotto - the sage was amazing and complimented the sunny egg. So delish.-french toast goat cheese - tasty with the strawberries and cheese flavor wasn't too overwhelming. -avocado omelette - standard dish done very well with hearty chunks of avocado and salsa. Yummy!-almond soda - this was interesting indeed and definitely warrants a try.Great brunch place! Worth the 30min wait."
"1.0","We just left Redfin Blues. It was awful, just an abortion of a culinary experience. I told them they should close and never reopen."
"2.0","Everything about this place seems very antiquated.  I wasn't impressed with my clam chowder.  There was some kind of bread component inside the clam chowder that may have been an attempt at dumplings but just tasted like soggy bread.  I'm not a fan"
"3.0","Here is why Gennaro's gets three stars:1.) Delivery or pick-up is fast, even late night (under 20 minutes).2.) It's cheap.3.) You can order online.The pizza itself isn't anything to write home about.  It's better than Papa John's but not as good as Domino's.  (The only reason I'd go with Gennaro's over Domino's for cheap pizza is that Domino's is always at least twice as long to deliver as they say they will be.)  If you go in for service, you will be disappointed--definitely had staff finish taking selfies and sending off texts before acknowledging that we were at the counter at all.Overall, it's okay."
"5.0","Don't go to DeLuca's. It's highly overrated, but Raymond's excellent.  Unique way of ordering and seating and food to table really moves the line along. Staff is very friendly. The blueberry pancakes were excellent. Omelette special was delicious."
"4.0","Excellent, fresh fish.  Nothing terribly interesting about the rolls, but the did the standard stuff (and the Steelers Roll?) very well.  And the waiter was helpfully able to tell our group about what fish was the most fresh.Location not ideal, tucked away in an empty mall.  But, that doesn't really impact the food, does it?"
"5.0","Kassab's is hands down my favorite place to eat in the South Side. My boyfriend and I love the food and the service and have dined here three or four times now. We always order too much because everything is so delicious we just can't narrow it down. Definitely the best Baba Ganoush around and you must have the house salad with Feta!"
"3.0","A group of us decided to head up on a Friday for happy hour around 6pm.  Three of us showed up originally and we expected five, so they sat us at one of the tables in the bar area.  More and more people joined us, and our final group was about eight.  It was a bit tight, but they were willing to make it work.  That said, I would still recommend making reservations so you can get a table in the dining area and you won't need to worry about huddling around a small table.  Their beer list is fairly lengthy.  Unfortunately it seemed like they were out of everyone in our group's first choice of beer.  When ordering drinks it's definitely worth having a back up ready just in case they're running low again.As far as food you have to with one of their many grilled cheese options.  I got the Mac Attack, a grilled cheese sandwich with macaroni and cheese.  It was delicious, cheesy goodness (with way too many carbs).  It came with fires and some tomato soup.  They go well with the sandwich, although I can't recommend dipping a Mac Attack into your soup.  It will probably not hold up.The wait staff was friendly and willing to accommodate our group as more people showed up than expected.  They were willing to work with us and tried to find us a bigger table, even while dealing with reservations.  That was nice, even if it didn't work out for us.All in all, it's a great place to go with friends after work.  I'll keep it in mind for the next time we decide to do a post-work happy hour."
"4.0","This place is amazing, they open until 2am in the morning which is great in a city where everything closes early. I live close and I call to order and they are always super fast preparing the pizza. The best I have tested so far is Nipper's special pizza."
"4.0","I'll admit, I usually come here after a fun time at Jimmy D's or Carson's, but this place has consistently kept me coming back (even in my not so level headed state of mind, oops)!!With ginormous slices of cheesy goodness, it's a hard stop to resist.Also, it might be a good idea to wear a dress or stretchy pants that day. You're welcome."
"5.0","This little Vietnamese restaurant is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. We always start our meal with the fresh spring rolls - we both order two each because we don't want to share. Their hoison dipping sauce recipe includes special peanut ingredients that make it unlike any other that other Vietnamese restaurants serve. For dinner, I always order number 17 with no noodles because I substitute extra vegetables. It's always perfect. It's always delicious. I can't find this particular dish at any other Vietnamese restaurant so I continually find myself ordering the same thing. The pho is also delicious but I often times will share half an order with somebody else so I can get my number 17 :-) The owner is a little abrupt but very friendly and you can bring your own bottle of just about anything and they will open it and serve it for you at no cost. You might be sitting next to a group of physicians, hipsters, corporate executives or students - they all flock here because the food is excellent and the price is always inexpensive."
"4.0","It should be noted that the restaurant changed hands in early 2019 and my visit today made that clear.  Everyone was welcoming and friendly and I received excellent service, not hallmarks of the old India Palace Cuisine. The food was delicious as always but there were not serving spoons for everything that was offered even after the lunch buffet was well underway. I wish the new owners much success.  You can expect to see me regularly!  I would dine with you more often if you regularly offered the staple dish of Indian buffets, aloo gobi (cauliflower and potato)."
"4.0","Sandwich business means you sometimes wait forever to get served (since it's order at the counter). Wednesday special, dozen bagels for $5.Please note that Pittsburgh is neither New York nor Montreal. But Bruegger's bagels are pretty good on their own terms."
"5.0","Hands down my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Incredible food, service and atmosphere. If there is ever a wait, it is always worth it. Somehow they manage to combine fine dining with a 'treat you like family' experience that keeps me coming back for more. Also an excellent wine list. For Italian in the Burg, I won't eat anywhere else! Big shout out and thank you to Madi for her amazing service on our last visit!"
"2.0","Hadn't been here in a year since they overcharged my credit card. Contacting them after mistake I was issued a $25 voucher. One item ordered were wings which came with celery sticks, wings were ok but fatty, celery sticks were white and limp with one of them being blackened and looking like dirt on it. Mentioned to bartender but just received a shrug. Also ordered burger with sweet potato fries...fries were chewy. Men's and women's restrooms dirty with sticky floors. Surprised Jerome keeps his name on a place like this. The location is excellent beside the Allegheny River and in middle of a lot of activity but that's about the only positive in my opinion. Have been there about 4 times over the years and never been pleased."
"4.0","The salad (with walnuts and cheese) and beef ropa sandwich are scrumptious. And the limeade, too."
"5.0","This place is great.  We tried it because my friend saw duck on the menu.  We walked in on a Friday night with no reservations and they were able to accommodate us.  The service was a little slow, but it was great service.  The woman remembered everything we needed or asked for. I think she may have been the only server for all the tables.  There was some bus boy helper, but he didn't actually wait on the tables. I got the tortellini with chicken and arugula and it was spot on delicious.  They only complaint was that it may have been a little too greasy.  But that made it taste pretty good, of course.  There was so much I had to take 1/2 of it home.   My friend got the duck, he said it was cooked fantastic and very good, but didn't care for the apples that came with it.  That was just his preference. I don't think it was anything regarding the way the apples tasted or were cooked. My friend also got the homemade tomato and arugula soup.  It was very fresh and was a good mix of flavors.  We also got bread with white bean hummus and our side salads included with our meals.  Both were very tasty and excellent.  We finished it off with a ricotta berry dessert that came in chilled mason jar.  It was the perfect ending to a great meal.  The portion was big and it was not sweetened.  Fresh berries and ricotta mixed together were a great simple combination. Overall the experience was great and we will definitely be back.  You get great fresh food, big portions and good flavors.  Plus you are supporting a local restaurant."
"4.0","I was biking around and decided to see the fountain at Bessemer Court, and this little stand right next to the fountain happened to catch my eye.  They have ice cream and Italian ice, (along with lots of other things), and when you combine the two, it is called Gelati.  I had a mango gelati, and it was a nice treat on a warm afternoon of biking.  The woman working the counter was very nice, and I had good service, and the treat was delicious, and VERY COLD . . . got a little bit of an ice cream headache . . . LOL."
"2.0","Recently went for family dinner and was not impressed, seated us all the way in the back for a fairly empty restaurant, smelled like wet carpets and grandmas basement. Took 15 minutes to be checked on for refills. Refills themselves took a long time. Chicken parm was very dry, penne vodka was bombed with pepper, if you're looking for good Italian food, pass on this place."
"5.0","What a pleasant surprise!  This is real home made Indian food, with a lot of care given to the spices, freshness and preparation of the food.  I recommend both the samosas as an appetizer and the tandoori chicken as an entrée -- the marinade is fantastic.The staff, service and ambiance were just as good.  I plan to return."
"5.0","What a great asset for Lawrenceville!!! This place has a ton of local food, which includes produce, meats and a good mix of other products. If there is something you can't find, the girls will look into it and put it on the shelf. They're very friendly and it's like I'm going to see a good friend every time I go to the store."
"5.0","Friendly service, and delicious food! Got the Lamb Shish plate and it came with a delicious salad + rice. Turkish coffee was a bit too thick, but otherwise tasted delicious."
"3.0","This Restaurant came highly recommended by local friends. I was dining by myself and decided to have four small rations like tapas, instead of a large meal. My waitress was very nice and helpful. The wine by the glass is limited and features wines from Galicia, Navarra, Alicante and Catalunya amongst others. There were a few legs of Jamon ibérico hanging above the bar. I was getting excited. I was raised in Madrid and recently spent a couple of weeks in Madrid, toledo, sevilla, Granada, etc. I assume that this restaurant presents itself as a Spanish establishment. The group next to me was having a 'fideua de mariscos ' that looked and smelled great. But the 'small plate' (read tapas) menu looked puzzling. Lots of bizarre combinations, kind of like if you let your ten year old cook and then start to add up things that really don't go together but they are having fun and in the end no one can eat it. The chef here could be an award winning pro with Michelin stars on his lapel. I don't know. And just because he chooses unlikely ingredients to create different gradations and pastel colors for your palate does not necessarily lead to a bad experience. That's the thing to do, right? I live in New York so maybe I am being unfair. I am not going to compare this place to la bernardin or 'per se'. Having said that, this place is not cheap and by Pittsburgh standards, these are new york prices. My first dish was a chorizo based meal with oil, Roquefort cheese and some pieces of dates in it. It was served cold and not even room temperature. The oil felt a little bit thick, didn't taste like olive oil to me and it dominated the experience. The cheese made me suffer a bit but I ate it. The rainbows and unicorns that are supposed to make your palate explode in extasis, were not simply there. I once was at a party with Paul Liebrand and he made a salad. When a chef makes something that makes you melt and you have no idea how to replicate that or how he did it, that's magic. This applies to the performing arts too. Cooking can be like painting, sculpting or playing bach partitas on a strad... I ate the chorizo because it was brought to me and I was hungry. That's all. I was drinking a glass of garnacha blanca. Next was the 'pulpo a la plancha'... The octopus was overcooked, chewy. Not a very generous portion. Maybe the purveyors come on Tuesday? This was a Friday. I guess I expected something like an homage to 'pulpo a la gallega'. Far from it. Underneath there was something that felt like mashed potatoes and I don't remember seeing any pimenton. But the place is dark. Again, no magic. I ate it, like someone who is forced to eat a meal at their aunt's home. It was a $16 appetizer after all. Next, I ordered a glass of red. I actually don't remember now, it wasn't memorable. I think it was a rioja. With the red, I procede with the ribs. Now, where do I begin. They were tender, yet dry and flaky. Also, they were sweet, as if they were going for some momofuku inspired Korean thing. But it wasn't even that sweet. There was basically no flavor and this one really disappointed. I am no expert but I can make amazing short rib and ribs with my instant pot. I didn't attend CIA. The last dish was the signature offer from the house, I'm assuming, because it was the 'morcilla'. It was actually brought in as the fourth course even though I asked for it as a third. But why not? Grand finale, right? Back up the truck! . Small portion, and dry. I felt like I was eating Styrofoam.  For a place that makes pretty oily dishes, this Morcilla (blood sausage) was not moist. Again, served with an amalgam of ingredients that neither my vision or palate could recognize. So, final thoughts : this place, under some kind of a Spanish heritage guise, fails to capture the essence of the flavors of Spain. I applaud the valor of the chef to be adventurous and, using avant guard ideas in the preparation of unique is always welcome. I once ate at a high end Italian in Tokyo. Everything looked and felt like Japanese traditional food. Yet, my mouth was convincing me that I was eating great Italian dishes, one after the other. By no means, in spite of my opinion, I am telling you not to visit 'Morcilla'. Everyone has a bad day. Maybe it was one of those. Furthermore, the group next to me, was having fun and they kept telling the waiter how glorious the 'fideua' was and how everything was prepared to perfection. Perhaps this is the way to go. Pittsburgh needs more places like this and I am impressed with the growth in the high end restaurant scene. I saw a nice feature on youtube about why pgh is the hottest place to eat and, 'morcilla' was featured. Not so fast. At least if you visit this place, avoid the 'tapas' (they don't call them that, oddly enough). And kudos to the servers, waiters and staff."
"4.0","Visited on a weeknight. There was one other couple dining so it was quiet and we sat right away. The waitress was friendly. The bean dip and bread they give you to start is super tasty. I ordered the salmon with coconut curry and greens, husband ordered the crab cakes with risotto. Our starter salads, with a helping of beets, were very good. The small aluminum bowl they serve it in is very awkward to eat out of, however. My salmon was quite good and cooked perfectly; the sauce tasted great but was a tad thin (making it drippy to eat). The greens were underdone, and served in large leaves that had to be cut to actually eat, which was difficult because of the underdone-ness. The well-done pieces were a good complement to the dish, though I would have preferred a starch with the salmon. My husband's crab cakes were very good, great crab-to-filling ratio, but he said he found several shell pieces. The risotto was the perfect texture but a hint too much salt for me.Now the ambiance, sadly, leaves much to be desired. There was no music playing in the front of the house, so we were serenaded by KISS FM being blared in the kitchen. The chef alternated between singing along with the music and sitting outside at their outdoor seating drinking a beer and chatting with buddies. He and our server often had personal conversation, which I don't mind if done out of earshot, but they made little effort to avoid airing their personal business for everyone inside. When you're paying $25 for an entree, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect some quiet mood music and atmosphere during your meal. This might be due to it being a slow weeknight, but still.We'll probably go back on weekends when it's busier and the staff are not so much in 'laid back' mode. All in all it's great, fresh food so I still recommend it."
"5.0","Awesome!  Egg salad was delicious and a very cool place.  The people working there seem very passionate about the restaurant and you can tell they love it.   I also bought a cool alpaca coat on our way out.  I am now very stylish!   It's worth the trip there for a solid place to eat"
"1.0","Must be kidding! Dirty as hell place is built between a few malls with pipes and crappy ceiling. Milk tea is one of the worst I've ever tasted. Can't even make good popcorn chicken, just a lot of flour. Poor and slow at making your food. Should probably be shut down by health inspection."
"4.0","This place is number one in the holy beef book of my parents and extended family.  Ruth's Chris is nice, but still a steakhouse chain.  It's 'Pittsburgh fancy'.  As a non-eater of cow, everyone is slightly confused on why this place is one of my favorites, but between the service, the bar, and the dessert, it's difficult to find something you don't like.I usually opt for a bottle of moscato, but last opportunity, I ordered the peach pear martini.  It was light, but had a real pear flavor--not that perfume one that happens way too often.  You receive the entire shaker which is exciting (or sad that it excites me), almost always there is little bonus drink left.  The +1 had an 'In Fashion':  pretty much an old fashioned with an orange liquor.  For a glass of mostly spirits, it was made well.Again, I cannot vouch for the steak. 95% of those in my party cleared their steak plates (with only one slight complaint from Mr. N who had a little tiff that his butter did not sizzle for long enough, but that's a whole different issue).  They apparently do it well, with LOTS of butter.  Speaking of butter, they also cook their chicken (my main go to) in these heaps of fat, and it is the best thing that has ever happened to that bird.  I've never had chicken elsewhere as tender as this.  A bird with the consistency of a beef filet (at least what I remember) is only found at Ruth's Chris.  Don't forget you order the sides separately, and that is where they get you.  Do not order a side for every person.  You will have multiple boxes of mashed potatoes and an extra forty bucks on your bill.Most importantly, you gotta order dessert here.  It may look lame  with basic berries and cream, crème brulée, ice cream, etc. 'Where is the bourbon salted caramel and hibiscus pate de fruits?' In Lawrenceville, probably.  But that doesn't mean the staples here aren't just as rich and delicious.  To be totally honest, I come here for the crème brulée. Vanilla bean custard under that torched sugar top and a side of berries is all I need.To prove the real reason this place is great, a tidbit of the N family being a total mess.  Last visit we managed to break two wine glasses and spill a water (it was my sister, I swear), causing a commotion which required two servers, a busboy, tablecloths, and a new cocktail to help us get our lives together.  And the service remained great for the rest of the meal. I know most places of this old man meat club genre would not have appreciated this to the point of scorn for our table.  But no, this isn't stuffy enough for that somehow.  Good drinks, incredible desserts, and not nearly as much frou frou as other similar spots. I hear the steak is all right too."
"4.0","Had lunch at Luke's. Enjoyed a great salad topped with Wild Alaskan Salmon. Wife had a great fish sandwich. Service was very good as well. With the check I used a $12 off Enjoy Coupon Book coupon. When server returned with the adjusted check, he pointed out restaurant's policy when using Enjoy coupon was to automatically add an 18% gratuity to the subtotal before discount. Not only is that not stated on their coupon but when calculating the 18%, they do it not just on the subtotal before discount but they add on the 7% sales tax. Tipping norms are that you don't include the amount WITH tax, when calculating tip, but it's the amount WITHOUT tax."
"3.0","The store is really cute.  Has some very cool mirrors and a few trays that are very decorative.  The restaurant is small.  Just 10-12 tables.  The service was great.  The food was OK.  Went for lunch, and tried to try a few things.  The empanadas were just OK.  They had some interesting sounding mixes but they were just ok. I had some peanut pumpkin soup that was the best thing I tried.  They did have a few veggie items, which I always appreciate.  Overall a fine stop for lunch, but nothing special."
"3.0","While the staff are friendly, the burgers were only ok. I got the Maggie's farm burger and I was disappointed the cheese wasn't melted and seemed like it was slapped on at the end. Same thing with the Mexican war burger, the cheese wasn't melted at all. The green chilis also were one big chunk so it wasn't spread well and would come out in one bite. The buns appeared to be regular white bread buns without sesame seeds. The upgrade to the rosemary fries for $1 was definitely worth it though. Overall, the burgers were just ok and not worth the $13. There is also metered street parking."
"5.0","Such a cool place. Great location (parking garage next door and lot across the street), friendly and knowledgeable staff, excellent beer selection. The food. Where do I begin. We got 2 grilled cheeses to share and they were absolutely amazing. Paired with some tomato soup and homemade fries. You can't go wrong here. And the prices for everything were competitive yet extremely affordable. I highly recommend this bar!!!"
"2.0","The info screen says they deliver but they don't. They direct you to call a delivery service to place your order. Wasn't difficult but was an extra step. The order was confirmed by the delivery service and they emailed the receipt immediately but the order was incorrect when it arrived. The chicken Lo mein was ok but overall lacked flavor. The wanton soup also lacked flavor and noodles were overcooked. The vegetable roll was excellent though. They also forgot the plastic silverware and napkins which I specifically asked for."
"5.0","If you are looking for a caterer for your next party, look no further.  The food here is exceptional.   A large bowl of delicious Rustic Italian bread bathed in olive oil and tasty seasonings, with thin slices of roasted red peppers and generous shavings of parmesan cheese was on our table when we arrived.  A fresh East Coast Caesar salad was our first course with a few large green olives and kalamata mixed in, (nice) along with what looked like large homemade croutons and again generous shavings of Parmesan cheese with a delicious and light Caesar salad dressing. A flavorful, fluffy Risotto with a plentiful mix of roasted vegetables was the starch we selected which was excellent. No gummy risotto here.  Two entrees were included in the price of our luncheon.  We chose a Roasted Boneless Lemon Chicken with Fresh Mozzarella which was the most tender and flavorful piece of chicken I think I've ever tasted.  Our second entree was a grilled Dill Salmon with a Tomato & Lemon Basil Aioli.  Dessert was cheese cake topped with mixed fresh berries.  If you want delicious food, freshly prepared and reasonably priced and don't care about a fancy decor this is the place for you.  I only wished I lived closer.  Sausalido would be the first place I would call to caterer a party.  Nick knows his stuff, I was impressed."
"5.0","I cant wait to come here again and again. Just stopped in for breakfast. It's so freaking CUTE. I got an egg sandwich and an ice coffee. Their bread is the best that I've had in a restaurant, a crusty roll that is so soft and flavorful in the inside. My iced coffee was delicious. Usually when I go out for breakfast they give me more food than I can handle, but the portions here are perfect. I'm excited to go back and see what they have for lunch."
"1.0","Too pricy with less quantity especially Biryani's. Definitely not a worth guys for Indians . Try checking other restaurants.  Check the below image for the portion."
"5.0","We live in Rochester, NY & came to Pittsburgh for the weekend and stumbled across this place. Absolutely amazing.. I've been thinking about it everyday since. Can't wait to go back! Amazing quality, great service and phenomenal breakfast foods."
"5.0","Absolutely fantastic experience!  I went with my boyfriend for a lunch date and we were promptly seated only moments after arriving.  The hostess was courteous and upbeat. You could tell she was genuinely happy to be there (which in my experience is uncommon).  The service was fast and well-timed! She knew exactly when to stop by to see if we were ready to order. The meal was excellent!  Very nicely presented! I got the spice lunch and enjoyed it very much. I'm so glad naan bread already comes with it instead of being extra (I LOVE naan bread, I'm pretty sure I have an addiction).I had a restaurant.com certificate with me and when the hostess noticed it she came over and happily enquired if I would like to use it. FINALLY! A restaurant establishment that doesn't make me feel like a bad person for having a coupon!  Final Thought:  Great atmosphere, fantastic service, delicious food.  I recommended this place to all!"
"3.0","The bubble tea is more like thai iced tea. Not bad, just not what I expected or what I wanted."
"4.0","My friend and I came here for Pittsburgh's Restaurant Week and it was one of the best experiences. Very rarely do we go places where they ask you if you want your coat checked. The atmosphere and mood here is somewhat confusing. The lights are dim. The tables are very comfortable and elegant. The staff is amazing. It was quiet when we first arrived, but then it got pretty loud. I don't think we were expecting this noise level, but we adjusted pretty quickly. Our steaks were amazing: his a NY Strip and mine a filet Mignon . The green beans were so fresh and tasty. The cheesecake as small as it was was the perfect size. It wasn't too sweet; I tell you: just right. The service was impeccable. We had multiple people serve us and pass by our table. We will be back for another great meal and vibe for good conversation."
"4.0","Ordered from Little Nippers II multiple times.  Each time I have been happy with what I have received, but I wouldn't call it fast food.Good food takes time to make, and in the case of their mild wings, they are good!  Skip the packet of dressing they give you and go home and put some quality blue cheese on these wings and you are in business!  Their pizza is o.k., but I have to say that I have not found pizza in Pittsburgh that measures up to the ones I can get back in New York, but then again their is a pizza place on every corner in my hometown. I will definitely be back, but will also make sure to call in or grub hub my order before to minimize the wait time."
"1.0","Out of gluten free regularly, it even at 4:00pm they won't take out more gluten free dough."
"4.0","Went there with my hubby for his birthday and we were pleasantly surprised. The sushi chef is actually Japanese, and you can really tell from the quality and authenticity of the food. The miso soup is REAL miso soup, not that watered down powdered stuff with tiny bits of chopped up tofu that you get in a lot of Japanese restaurants.You won't find anything too fancy on the menu as most of the offerings are pretty standard fare for a Japanese restaurant. For an appetizer we had the beef tataki which was very flavorful. We had the sushi lover for two with 28 pieces of maki and nigiri. It came with two pieces of the fattiest fatty tuna (toro) that I have EVER seen and it literally melted in my mouth! I've eaten a lot of sushi in my life and I was absolutely shocked. We finished off our meal with some fried ice cream in a yummy smooth red bean sauce. The server was really nice too and knew the menu really well. Overall we left extremely satisfied - it helped that we had a $25 restaurant.com certificate (otherwise it would have been too pricey to try the place). It was very high quality and authentic sushi, as well as a pleasant dining experience. I think this place is highly underrated, probably because of the high prices and shopping mall location, but next time you're craving great Japanese food, get yourself a restaurant certificate and try it out!"
"5.0","Best Nepali food in Pittsburgh! Very reasonably priced - a plate of momos for under $5!Get the Kothe momos, they are awesome!"
"2.0","I'm not new to the slightly higher price point, chain steak house circuit.  If Ruth's Chris had a rewards program, my family would have free steak for life.  That being said, I know what is expected here.  It's going to be stuffy and overpriced; you know that.  But your expectation is the food and service should make up for those little trips.+1 and I are early 20s, cute lil' professional guys.  I understand we are a contrast to the older people in floor length furs, but we didn't come in off the street like a bunch of ruffians demanding cheese fries (although the ladies behind the host podium would have disagreed).  After being greeted with 'do you have a reservation', we let them know we were early and would have a drink at the bar until our scheduled time was up.  Drinks were fine. Whatever.We were taken to our table which was one of two placed right in front of the kitchen and that terrifying eagle.  They're kind of like the next to the bathroom booths.  When I asked our hostess if we could move to one of the few (3+) open tables that were actually in the dining room, she said she couldn't do that (I would normally freak out over this, but somehow that pales to the rest of the night).  Our waiters and helpers/runners were awesome.  They weren't nearly as personable as you'd expect, but they didn't act like we were confused and didn't mean to be there.Now here, judging by the other reviews, I should rave about the food.  That is absolutely not going to happen.  This is also going to be much more harsh than it should be as I was expecting (what I suppose is) way too much.  Way harsh, T. Oops.Because I don't do seafood, we ordered the fries 'to share' .. The portion you receive of the truffle fries is sad.  If Burgatory's truffle fries are a 10, these may get a 4.  We both ordered our double priced Caesar salads and were given small plates of yellow iceberg.  I can't tell you how sad this was.  A few shavings of asiago I was able to find saved my sanity that night. For our main courses, I ordered the chicken that makes more an hour than I do, and +1 got the strip steak.  He said it was 'good,' but was not impressed in the slightest.  My chicken tasted like I did nothing but threw a chicken in the oven and then cut it in half and served it to you with some blackened cooked shriveling yellow carrots.  It was sad.  So sad we didn't even get dessert.  I just wanted to get out of there.  The only decent sustenance I received was 200% marked up glass of Riesling.If you are thinking of going here, it won't be the worst.  Clearly, people enjoy it.  But if you are one of those people that may have expectations for anything ever or don't happen to have some extra change from your hedge fund to waste, keep walking until you hit Ruth's Chris or something that isn't going to make you cry into your fifty dollar piece of meat (at least that would season it)."
"3.0","The good - generous portions (though not cheap), good flavors - the mezze platter was very good, as were the kefta kebabs.The bad - 1) some items were dry, like old pita and overcooked chicken kebabs; and 2) lazy, disengaged service. Our waitress was more interested in sitting in the back of the restaurant on her laptop than in serving us or the handful of other tables.My recommendation - a decent option for a quick sandwich, but not a dinner destination."
"5.0","Nothing to complain about over here! * Food: I've been here around 4 or 5 times and I've never had a bad experience. Most of the time, I order the Tikka Masala but I decided to try something new and order the Kadai with Chicken. We ordered a side of paratha and naan which could probably be shared with 2-3 people. The Kadai was delicious and wasn't too spicy at all! Although I still love my Tikka Masala more, the Kadai was still really good. I think the first time I had Indian food was at this restaurant and they definitely did not disappoint.* Cost vs. Worth: Their entrees are about $13-$15 which is what to be expected in Pittsburgh. I know they have a lunch buffet around that price and is very much worth it.   Will I come here again? - Of course!!"
"4.0","The squid linguini is now my go to dish. Being that it's a very cozy inside, think NYC small, they can at times run out of fresh items toward the end of the evening. My wife loves their gnocchi and makes me dine here at least once a month just for that dish."
"5.0","I just left & oh my gawd THE best burger (sorry Five Guys) I've ever had!!!!!! I'm new to the area and wanted to escape my Airbnb & came across this gem thanks to YELP! I built my own burger & chose slaw as my side. A bit expensive, but worth every penny."
"1.0","Oh..where to start, have been here two years before and was decent but it has gone down the drain now. We had flies buzzing around..one fly flew into the water glass. Yuck!!Also, very Poor service. Didnt check back EVEN once during our meal.Missing ingredients in Oothappam, a simple south indian dish. Refused to fix the dish..or offer anything in reduction.Also they sat us near to the bathroom/kitchen area although many othet tables were open.Sorry, not going here again!"
"4.0","The Yard has a ton of potential to be a great bar and casual restaurant. A large space combined with a comprehensive food and beer menu tell the best story.  During my recent trip to Pittsburgh I ended up at the Yard twice. The first time was for a night cap drink and the second time was for another night cap drink and a little snack. Well it was a little snack for me, as I just picked off my friend's huge Pierogie Grilled Cheese sandwich. I'm talking ginormous; Texas toast and full sized Pierogies- it was the works. He also ordered a side of Mac 'N Cheese. That was also pretty tasty, but I just warn that bacon was included. I love bacon however I wouldn't be happy if I was vegetarian and found bacon in my food without notice. I'm not going to walk you through the extensive menu or drink list, but I highly recommend you check it out yourself. Both nights I went for a local brew and thoroughly enjoyed my Fat Head's Bumble Berry.Our server the first night was very patient and happy to answer any questions about the brews. The second night we ordered from the bar and the bartender of the evening rubbed me the wrong way. I asked him for a printed copy of the beer list so I can review the beer selection. He provided a menu but also told me that the beers were listed above the tap. Well, duh. I saw the list but it didn't have the detailed description I was looking for. It wasn't a big deal; I just hope he doesn't do that often. Under the category of random and cool, there was an outlet on the customer side of the bar. That is such a good idea! I mean, how many times has your phone been dying or died while you are out at a bar?So overall, I had a great experience. I'm sure after the growing pains, The Yard will turn into a staple establishment in Shadyside."
"5.0","I love this place! Great atmosphere and view right on the water. They've got tiki torches and beach drinks, and it doesn't even feel like you're in Pittsburgh anymore. Great indoor outdoor bar too. The food is just ok, nothing extraordinary, and sometimes the wait is long. But I just grab a drink at the bar while I'm waiting, and enjoy the atmosphere. Definitely recommend!"
"2.0","This pizza hut is very hit and miss, but mostly miss.The main problem is not enough sauce.  In order to combat this, I even ordered extra sauce but there was still barely any on the pizza.They are generally good about giving a lot of crust flavor, but sauce and cheese game is too weak.  Better off at Little C's."
"4.0","I had amazing service here, so I'll start off by saying that! For my dish, I had the coconut curry ramen & I added mushrooms and chicken. However, I hated the mushrooms I got, which the waitress suggested, but that's not her fault, I let her pick them. Anyway, the fried cauliflower is to die for. Incredible! I thought overall it was a good meal, and I could go again. I just think that maybe my dish wasn't the best thing I could've chosen for what I usually go for. I'll be back to try something else though!"
"5.0","The Fox Chapel Burger is the best burger I've ever had. Every time I'm here I want to get something different, but I just can't. The size of the burger is perfect, you can actually take a bite! Cheese fries are also getting a reputation in Lawrenceville because so many of us are addicted to them. The space is nice, service is quick and friendly. They also have a changing table in the men's & women's rooms which is great for all the families in the neighborhood."
"5.0","I love this cozy little restaurant!  The $10 meal deal is especially great for indecisive diners like me, and it's always delicious.  I can't comment on how closely they adhere to Peruvian cuisine, because I've never had it before.  The shop is fun too, but I'd feel awkward browsing the art without intending to stay, so I only look around after I'm done eating."
"2.0","Resturant was not very busy but the service was quite slow. My daughter and I wanted a pizza and surprised at the cost for a pizza. It was basically like flat bread with cheese. The bread they brought out was cold and seemed like could have been sitting there most of the day.I did receive a call from their DM this morning about our experience at this location last night after a survey I filled out on line. Very impressed with their promptness in responding to complaints."
"3.0","The food is good. The staff is cold and unfriendly. I have been here twice and both times I was made to feel a bother. Didn't want to answer questions. Food is good. The restaurant is messy with boxes, miscellaneous stuff like two dried dead plants in the front window ....Food is really good so I will go back again. I will bring others to just don't expect 'Palace' treatment."
"4.0","This is a solid seafood place. Their seafood is fresh. My family and I went as a celebration of my brother being in town and seafood is usually the best neutral cuisine for us. I was quite impressed with the taste of everything but the four stars and not five is because of the service. Let me start with the food. We ordered 3 appetizers as there were 6 of us: one dozen oysters (east & west coast), calamari, and mussels. Each dish was fantastic. I could've eaten the oysters by myself. I didn't want to stop. I'm sad I only got 3 of them. They were extremely fresh and you could tell the difference in taste for either region. The calamari was fried but the breading was light and the calamari itself was not chewy at all - just as calamari should be. Lastly, the mussels were yummy! The light wine sauce it came in and the freshness of the mussels was such a great combo, even down to the bread, it was tasty. We really loved our apps. My gram got the lobster bisque and she said it was the best she ever had. Next, our entrees. I ended up with the grilled swordfish. My whole dish was so lovely. However, I asked to sub my potatoes with a salad and apparently our waiter or the cook staff didn't do that and I got potatoes and my salad but no asparagus. I had to ask for it and I'm glad I did because they were out of this world. I've never had asparagus that good! On top of my swordfish was lump crab and they give you plenty. It was really just super flavorful and I really enjoyed it. It seemed like everyone enjoyed their dishes except my brother who thought the salmon dish was a bit bland, especially the kale. It's not a lot of food with that dish. But my other brother loved his seafood pasta and so did my dad. My mom also loved the cod and my gram loved her crab cakes. I also got a dessert because my brother mentioned it was my birthday (which it is soon lol) and we ordered the flourless chocolate tort cake and it was great! Not too sweet and pretty tasty. Ok. So the service. When we arrived, we were a little early for our reservation but they sat us anyway. The people that worked there did not seem friendly at all. At one point one of the waiters needed to come by us and he would've knocked us all over if they didn't move out of the way. He didn't even say excuse me or acknowledge us at all. After we were sat we had to wait at least 15 minutes before our waiter even came to get our drink orders. Although he was really nice, he was pretty slow and it wasn't even busy until we got our main dishes. He forgot a lot of things we needed, too. But it is what it is. Still great food, regardless!"
"5.0","THE BEST tacos around. There is not much to them, yet they are so flavorful and fresh. My favorite tacos are the shrimp with everything on them, of course. We became Edgar fans when he was on the street up from Pamela's Diner. It was almost the perfect location, since every time we would enter the strip we would walk past and buy our obligatory tacos. When we realized he relocated, we were disappointed at first, but we learned that he has a closer location on Penn Ave and one that's further down the strip on 26th street. The workers are friendly and accommodating and his newer location has a sign out front saying they now cater (I don't remember this at the last location). I'm so happy they are expanding and look forward to many more taco stops this summer."
"4.0","I came here for a late bite on Restaurant week, and man -- wicked good Mac and Cheese. Made with melty, creamy Gouda, and with bacon liberally mixed in, this stuff is the real deal. Also, for an extra couple bucks, I had a mountain of pulled pork heaped on top. It was like an extra meal on top of my meal, and man, did it satisfy. The only thing holding me back from 5-starring this place is that my and my wife's drinks weren't great. Cheap, and served promptly, but a vodka-soda and a Tom Collins aren't exactly what I'd deem 'hard to nail.' Still, I would eat here again in a heartbeat. Great bar food."
"3.0","Ki Ramen is definitely good/solid. I tried the Shoyu Ramen- the fried chicken was delicious but otherwise I think the bowl was lacking a bit of flavor. I also had a little bit of the Ki Signature Ramen which I enjoyed significantly more, it had a lot going on and all of the different things complimented each other really well. It was also my first time trying pig ears and I look forward to trying it at other restaurants moving forward. The noodles in both dishes were a bit undercooked. Ki Ramen is in an ideal spot in Lawrenceville. They have a cute space and the service was really great. I don't see this becoming one of my go-to's but if I'm in the area, I would stop by again."
"4.0","The small plates were amazing: delicious and complex (crab tartine and burrata); the large plates were good (mushroom risotto and shrimp fra diavalo). Super cute space! And wait staff were great."
"3.0","The service was very good. My server was very attentive to my needs.  The fried chicken lunch special was marginal. The chicken was deep fried for so long it became hardened.  Not sure if they were trying their hand at Bon Chon chicken tempura style but that definitely was not it. ;)"
"5.0","The pizza is great. The delivery guy is really nice. I like thin crust pizza, so I wish it could be a little bit more thinner. Other than that, everything is perfect"
"5.0","Wow! This is one of my new favorite places and probably in my top 5 places to eat in Pittsburgh now. That naan seriously! Get the naan. They have super generous portions. I think enough to share a whole meal with someone. Everything I've had here is excellent! It is also nice that it is a little off the hustle and bustle of the strip and even have their own parking lot."
"5.0","This has quickly become one of my go to spots.The cocktail and beer menu is extensive. Their old fashions are the perfect balance of sweet and bourbon, neither overpowering the other. I highly recommend coming for their happy hour. Cocktails are $6 and you can get a pound of mussels for $8. Can't beat that. And, to top it all off, they have a bunch of board games that you bring to your table."
"5.0","A friend introduced me to this spot and i am not lying when I say this place has the best tacos I've ever had!! Super welcoming staff and ALWAYS serving food on point! I will give this place my business any day of the week!"
"5.0","Peppi's is great. It is a pittsburgh original. If it's your first time try one of the named sandwiches from the middle of the menu. (Can't go wrong with a New Yorker  or a big wheeler)"
"5.0","After my first visits here, I found It was surprisingly good! Didn't  expect anything special for a hot dog shop. But I can taste the meat they put in the dog were good. And now I am a returning/regular customers here. And i would recommend friend going over and anybody who is in the neighborhood to try this place out."
"5.0","This place makes me feel like I'm in NYC.  The outside and ambiance aren't anything special or spectacular but the food is unbelievably good.  I strongly recommend the Thai Style Fried Rice.  The yellow curry and cashew tofu were also very tasty.I normally don't review places that have over 20 reviews but I figured I had to give a shout out to the vegans / vegetarians.  The tofu is really tasty and if you order the fried rice with tofu they automatically leave out the egg.  Lots of other options available for vegans.  The parking is street only.  Credit Cards are accepted.  Good place to bring a date or a group of friends for a casual yet tasty meal."
"5.0","Wonderful dinner with good company . I really enjoy the mussel appetizer. And. Steak dinner , we and our dinner with Italian expresso"
"1.0","I hate to leave a bad review. But...  we were there on Sat. Made a reservation. Got there on time. The place was packed. It is a small place with minimal ventilation. We were seated and ordered food almost immediately. The waitress was a total space cadet.  Not ONCE she asked if we needed anything including very much needed water in this crammed poorly ventilated room.  We made the crucial mistake to order pork chop. This took more than  1.5 hours. I left for a little time to move outside and breathe. Meanwhile we had to literally hunt someone down for a water refill. After an hour, we were told that pork chops took at least 45 min. I add that we got salad that is part of the meal. One was served in a bowl. One in a small ice cream cup!  The salad consisted of dressing with some salad stuff in it and the bowl was totally dirty.  Once food arrived, I really couldn't breathe. So we asked for the check. It arrived but we were charged for the wrong meal which was $4 more expensive that what I ordered..chicken. I couldn't take it.  So we bailed out.  We also observed similar frustrations on all the nearby tables. Including a charred steak that was not edible.  Food was only ok."
"5.0","Food was amazing! Parking was free and convenient! Well done and very much enjoyed. The egg drop soup is the best. House special crispy spicy chicken was amazing"
"5.0","Onion maiden is by FAR the best vegan restaurant I've ever been to. I'm a bit of a stickler in terms of 'health conscious food' I'm one of this vegans that try to stay healthy predominantly 90% of the time, however, EVERYTHING IS HEALTHY. I can definitely taste that everything is quality and for the most part - absolutely wholesome and minimal ingredients! I love love love it here. I could eat it every day. Love the dessert, love the meals. I'm gonna have to say it's a complete 10/10. Such a great vibe and atmosphere as well.  thank you for providing Pittsburgh with the best vegan foo"
"2.0","I saw all the 5-star ratings and I thought maybe the place had improved, but the pho is really mediocre here. They put a lot of cilantro and scallions in the broth, which is something I like, but it seems like they kind of skimp on the beef and bones they use to make the broth, so it's really thin... almost watery. I suppose if you like a lighter broth with lots of herbs & black pepper in it, this is your spot... but I need my broth to be rich and aromatic."
"5.0","It didn't look like much from the outside, but it was a fabulous little Napolese place! The owner works there all the time and I think he is the main cook. I had never had Napoli food before, but it was very interesting. Lots of spices but not necessarily spicy. They also have other Indian- and Asian-based food on their menu. We tried the momo appetizer (tasty little won-ton-like dumplings) and the Chicken Napoli was our main meal. Worth going into the nondescript door and up the stairs!"
"3.0","This is an older retail store.  I normally have a loving relationship with Eat 'n Park, but this one just didn't hit home for me.  I came during the Sunday Brunch Buffet; my friend partook, I abstained after seeing the fare.  I ordered two eggs over-easy with a side of toast.  Getting beyond the murky, dated feel of the store, it was actually fairly clean on the interior and in the restrooms.  I received my food and the eggs were cooked perfectly.  Maybe not a big deal for some, but you would be surprised at how often over-easy comes out over-hard or, worse, uncooked.  I think the real reason I enjoy Eat 'n Park most of the time is the normal salad bar items."
"1.0","I had a horrifying experience at Sorrentos, not because of the food, but because of the register girl. I could not find my receipt slip and she refused to give me my order until I did so. I paid with a credit card and she had rung me up about 10 minutes prior. She clearly remembered who I was and could have checked her receipt slips to see that I had in fact paid. She was extremely rude about the entire situation and looked very unsanitary. I will never go to Sorrentos again and she should absolutely be fired."
"5.0","Pittsburgh has some amazing places to eat. We found this little gem. Such a sweet little place. Food and service was amazing."
"5.0","I wish I could give this restaurant more than 5 stars. Everything was so good.  We had the Bunn O))) and Eyeatetots, and the Kale Satan and Kimmy Gibbler dawgs.  The Bunn O))) was definitely our favorite.  We also had the most delicious vegan cheesecake. If you're looking for a really great meal - whether you're vegan or not - you should definitely eat at onion maiden. Oh, and it's byob!"
"4.0","Great Queso! It has a nice smokey flavor. The Mango Margarita is a must try if you like fruity drinks. Food is authentic Mexican."
"5.0","Great little taco stand. Tacos have a great authentic taste. And the atmosphere makes you feel like your in a small little Cali food stand."
"5.0","Was here on a quiet Thursday night but that was totally fine with me. The staff was very nice and the inside was cute and rustic. I got a drink (can't remember the name now) and a burger that was delicious. Not rushed at all and it was a nice place to come on a late night. The rest of their menu looked great as well!"
"2.0","I love Panera and the food in this location is great. However, I must say that the service sucks!!! They are such idiots who work at this location, stuck up, and expect only college students to eat here. The staff looked at me like I was crazy since I wasn't in college. Also, I see the employees' here texting, being unprofessional, and not even working! I would give this 5 stars if the people who work here would do their job. I had even asked why they don't put out napkins and I never see any of the staff putting out napkins, straws, or anything like that when they run out of napkins and I always have to ask them for napkins and they just give me a weird look. I don't recommend anyone going to this location if you rather have professional workers!!"
"2.0","Based on decor, I think the intent is you feel you are dining at Nona's house.  Given the overwhelming stench of mildew, moisture, and feeling of dampness, you feel like you're dining in Nona's kitschy basement dungeon/kitchen, and Nona is having issues with water and her foundation.Seriously wtf.  I knew they used space heaters to heat the restaurant in the Winter, but something is seriously wrong and likely unsafe with thier building.  My friends wanted to stay an eat, so against my better judgement I had lunch and considered it multi tasking -- eating and inhaling toxic mold spores at the same time.Our waitress was nice.  I ordered the Pasta Del Sol and my friend had the Chicken Parm.  I also had a wilted, yellowed caesar salad with my pasta but I didn't send it back bc I was starving and obviously down for anything (for eating there in the first place).the pasta del sol was so so, but anything involving carbs cant be too wrong.  The chicken parm was actually VERY good, and it was a relatively inexpensive lunch.I wont be back though, its seriously grody inside and if there are no mold issues they at least need air purifiers thruoghout.  I hope someone from Buca corporate reads this and takes action."
"4.0","A great place to grab a sandwich if you're in the strip district for the day. This place is a classic just like Primanti Brothers. Fast quick and easy the workers are welcoming and kind. I stoped in on a Sunday to get a sandwich with my girlfriend. We both got the Italian and it was great. The Italian dressing is made with balsamic vinegar which makes it a little different and unique. The bread is soft and fresh. I added mayonnaise to my sandwich and it gave it a great little addition of creamy to pair with the acid of the vinegar. I personally prefer the original location in North Side. Although the strip district location accepts credit cards!  If you've not tried Peppi's sandwiches you've not had a true Pittsburgh experience. Their menu has something for everyone and you will not leave disappointed."
"1.0","This place might be great, but I'll never know, and they'll never get my business or that of my family.  I just called to inquire whether they take reservations.  The response was 'Nope, it's a first come first serve basis', and a HANG UP.  I called back to give feedback; the same person answered 'hello' and HUNG UP AGAIN when he heard my voice.  If this is a traditional Pittsburgh eatery, I'm ashamed to be a Pittsburgher.  What I love about this city is its humanity.  I have no problem with the policy...just never hang up on a customer.  It's a shame for the restaurant; we have a large family that we had planned to host.  Shame on them for losing a big tab!"
"2.0","Eh.  Stopped by here for lunch today as I was waiting for my phone to be fixed.  I had the Salmon Burger so I was expecting a slab a Salmon but it was a mixture of weird stuff and I'm sure very little Salmon.  The fries and ketchup were also eh.  The only positives were the service and the price.  $16 for a beer and sandwich isn't bad at all.  Can't say I'd rush back."
"5.0","Was an employee at this Excellent Establishment for 2 years, left on great terms and enjoyed every minute of my employment. I'd highly recommend trying the food and I'm bummed that I can't personally serve you and watch you enjoy it. Watching the food come out was always amazing and the head Chef Mike does nothing but a perfect job on every dish! The seasonal menu is always creative and uses nothing but the freshest indigence (I know, I had to go get them). The owner Nick takes extreme pride in his work and makes it his personal goal that you enjoy your experience. TRY IT OUT!!!!"
"5.0","This is a great Philly and really as good as anything in Philly for that matter.  I recommend the Ultra if you like big and great.  The regular cheese steak is what I get these days though.  It is enough for me!"
"3.0","Unfortunately, Brighton Heights only has a few places within walking distance (or free delivery distance) that make good food.  Wiseguys is one I'm still on the fence about. I've had several items from them, wings, sandwiches, and pizza. Their pizza is par with the rest of the city, nothing special to write about. Their steak sandwich was bland and overcooked, but the veggies they added on were cooked well. They have several other sandwiches that are covered in obnoxious amounts of toppings, probably just to confuse your palate to thinking that you're eating something good. I must say though, their bread is really good. And this is coming from a South Philly girl. Their wings are hit or miss. The first few times I've ordered them, they were big and cooked well. I ordered last night, and they were puny and soggy. And now they charge 25¢ more for crispy? So I paid the extra charge and still got soggy wings. Oh, and don't tell me about delivery times,  I live two minutes from wiseguys. I think if they could get their consistency down, I'd be happy to order more often. They're great in a pinch, though. Happy Eating!"
"5.0","This is one of the best Indian restaurant I have been in Pittsburgh and anything closer to south indian food in taste and quality."
"5.0","Great little neighborhood bar with a lot of history. Usually a good mix of old-timers sitting at the bar watching sports and a younger crowd grabbing a bite to eat and waiting for one of the nightly events. There is usually something going on each night, bluegrass bands, open mic acoustic and comedy, 'obscure game night', or whatever big sports game is happening on the big screen.Hambone's isn't my 'go to' place, but I do stop in often. Staff is friendly and prompt, the crowd is never too loud or insane, and the food menu is pretty good. Food is a little bit pricey from what I'm used to spending (yes, I'm cheap), but is definitely worth it. I'm a bit addicted to their Mac and Cheese with gouda and bacon; I really don't want to eat any other  Mac and Cheese for the rest of my life if it is not made this way.This place is non-smoking, which is nice, but they do have a little seating area (that they've satirically dubbed 'Paradise') near the back. If you need to grab a quick smoke, you can take your drink, sit at the picnic tables and chairs placed on the un-level, cement courtyard area, and enjoy Paradise.Also, if you're into pinball, they have a few machines in the very back by the kitchen. They currently have 3 machines up: Pirates of the Caribbean, the old Star Trek, and the super new Wizard of Oz, but I'm sure this is something that changes periodically.So, in conclusion, go to Hambone's."
"5.0","I had never had Arepas (pronounced a-rape-as) or Venezuelan food at all until I moved across the street from this hidden gem. If you like chalupas, you will love Arepittas! The 'bun' is kind of a fried corn pancake that is split like an English muffin. The fillings are so savory and delicious you can't go wrong. I have to hold myself back from eating these every day, they are so good! The owner is super friendly and remembers your name. He even called me by name when we randomly saw one another on the street! If you are in the neighborhood before their 4:00 pm closing time, be sure to give this place a try."
"3.0","Not bad as a basic lunch spot, at least if you don't mind iceberg lettuce, but it's not even remotely authentically Peruvian.  One or two dishes sound more or less on track, but the vast majority of the offerings are just unadulterated run-of-the-mill American.  And in fact, 'ropa vieja', which they feature, is actually a Cuban dish and definitely not Peruvian. Latino cuisines are very far from interchangeable.  I won't even go there any more if I can avoid it because it's not even wonderful for American food; there are just too many better options around these days.  I've spent a lot of time in Peru, all over, and with close Peruvian friends, plus I make Peruvian food at home from some really good cookbooks, and I know the cuisine well.  It is totally beyond me why people think this place is so great, even as an American restaurant. It's just adequate. Plus, it's upstairs and not wheelchair accessible - or easy to get to even without a chair if you have any mobility limitations.  I'm so tired of inaccessible restaurants in this day and age that I'm automatically taking off at least one star for every one that isn't, especially when it *is* possible to make them accessible.  There *is* room for an elevator here - which would also make the bathrooms accessible for patrons of Pamela's.  So, one star off for lack of authenticity, one for being just average anyways, and the third for inaccessibility.  Sorry!"
"2.0","This location does not fail to always forget something from my order. Every single time I go just to get, for example, a famous bowl and biscuits, they forget the biscuits. I've ordered cookies before and they forget those too. Every single time and i'm not exaggerating they forget something."
"5.0","I love their pizza! Can be a little pricey but I have yet to be disappointed! Their garlic butter sauce is to die for"
"4.0","We ordered delivery dinner for four from Beta Bites. The order was placed online via the restaurant's website. I liked that one could select individual toppings for sandwiches, just as if one were there in person. The order arrived within an hour, the stated time, and all items were correct and hot.I ordered a Beta Kufta Sandwich. Kufta is a Moroccan take on the Mediterranean kofta. Mine was made with rolled ground beef, with toppings such as lettuce, tomato, and onions. The Moroccan spices were delicious! Extra sauce provided, too. The sandwich came with French fries, equally good. All of our party enjoyed their meal. Definitely a successful ordering in experience."
"5.0","One sentence description of my experience just in case you don't read the full review: this place serves amazing food with delicious flavors and one of my favorite Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh. We were here for Friday dinner after an exhausting week. The place seemed to be busy but fortunately, we were able to find a table for 2 people immediately. The wait staff is very friendly and nice. They gave us ample time to look at the menu and place our order. One thing to remember when you visit this place is, they follow the spice levels sincerely. So, please know your spice level before you place order here. We ordered chicken satay, Pad thai, and pineapple curry. The portion sizes are generous, and the plate is well made and organized. I will start with the chicken satay. They are generous portions of 6 chicken served over 6 sticks with peanut chutney and other veggies on the side. The chicken is well marinated and packed with subtle flavors. It is so juicy that I liked it just by itself with any peanut chutney. However, adding the peanut chutney just added another layer of flavor which made it even better. I highly recommend this dish. We ordered Pad thai with breaded tilapia and spice level of 6. Usually, the add-ons at many other places are less in quantity. However, they added generous amount of tilapia to the Pad thai. Just the noodles with fried egg and tamarind sauce flavor is delicious and adding tilapia to it just elevated the dish to another level. We had enough to bring it back home for a late dinner! Last, but not the least, pineapple curry which is served with a good bowl of rice and a spice level of 5. The dish looked so colorful and again generous quantity with a good number of pineapple chunks. I loved the soupy part of the dish which consisted of coconut flavor mixed with a bunch of other spices. Good quantity for one person if they are extremely hungry, but there will enough for a left over if you are someone with a small appetite. Overall, great experience and great food with flavors that are on-spot. I highly recommend this place and it is good to dine alone, to go on a date, or to hang out with a bunch of friends. Also, they have take out which is also very popular."
"2.0","Just got the buffalo shrimp appetizer.  It should only have tails on, as the rest is covered in red hot sauce, but there were pieces of shells all along the shrimp you couldn't see.  That is not a pleasant experience.  We had to keep spitting out shrimp.  What a waste!  Servers at the bar were very nice, but they never asked us how the shrimp were before we got our next course.  They did replenish share plates and silverware and napkins for the next course.  The grilled chicken chopped salad we had next was okay, but a little heavy on salad dressing."
"5.0","Chef Matt Christie plays on a diverse culinary background to delight the palate and eye.   A refreshing take on the best street food from around the world with Traditional French components at the core of each dish.   What a fantastic addition to the Pittsburgh food scene!  A must dine experience for any Pittsburgh foodie."
"5.0","Cinderlands is a welcomed gem in the Lawerenceville neighborhood. They have it all, great craft beer (brewed in-house), delicious food, local PA spirits and televisions! Usually around the burgh you have to choose between a place with a tv and mediocre food/beer or a place with good beer/food and no TVs. Not here!The staff is incredibly friendly and enjoys talking about both the beer and food menus. They must all be very involved in the process because both bartenders I have been served by knew a lot about the beer and food. More than just the normal memorization of the listings. Drink must haves: the Coffee flavored IPA, the regular IPA, seasonal cocktail (can't remember the name but it was made with a local rye whiskey and our friend who is not a big drinker loved it so much he ordered another)Food must haves: Chicken sandwich. The homemade pickles are soooo good! Brisket sandwich was out of this world! I will update this post as I try new items but so far I am thoroughly impressed."
"5.0","Great food, nicest waiters in the world. We had the Italian coquielle for appetizers and it was AMAZING. Their candied walnut salad is to die for. Their entries are simply superb. I highly recommend this place, it's a gem!!"
"2.0","Like its other locations downtown and by CMU, this Squirrel Hill storefront offers food for a bargain.  For $6, you can get rice and all four of the vegetarian (vegan, too, I think) dishes OR rice, the chicken, and two of the veggie selections.  The portions are huge, and can feed you two days in a row if you've got a good appetite, or maybe even three days in a row.  Unlike the other locations, the Squirrel Hill branch only serves dinner, and only Monday-Friday.The four vegetarian dishes available the day I visited were a dal, spinach with black-eyed peas, chickpeas and potatoes, and tofu with mixed veggies.  Of the four, I disliked the tofu and mixed veggies--I'm a fan of tofu, but this tofu was way too spongy.  The other three selections were all right, though not spicy at all and too liquid-y.  As other reviewers have remarked about the other locations, the naan was really a piece of store-bought flatbread that tasted a little stale to me.Does Sree's have the best Indian food?  No.  Is it one of the best options for dinner in Squirrel Hill?  No.  Is it worth the money, if you're on a tight budget and want something fast and filling?  Yes."
"5.0","I love this place. I am a fan of coffee, not tea so I am biased. But I had this amazing coconut cream chocolate banana something or other blend (it wasn't full of sugary flavoring or anything, it was just the tea) and it was one of the best cups of tea ever. The woman working behind the counter (I think she was the owner) knew all of the teas and could tell me about every blend and flavor. It is a great space and has an extensive menu. I am not from the area, but if I were, I would be there all the time."
"1.0","TL;DR- bad service, bad food, unclean bathroom.My boyfriend and I arrived at this restaurant 15-20 minutes before the rest of our party arrived, so we decided to order a couple cocktails. It wasn't especially busy in the restaurant, but it took 30 minutes to get our drinks. By the time we got our drinks the rest of the party had arrived and had been seated for enough time to look over the menu and drink menu. Another member of our party was interested in wine and ordered something off of the wine list. He was told that they had almost none of the wines on that list. As for the ramen, I tried the Yuzu shio ramen, their so called specialty. It was too spicy and you couldn't taste the ramen at all. The quality of ramen was less than I would get making frozen ramen at home. At the end of our meal I want to the bathroom, and it was disgusting. Looked like no one had been in to clean it for at least a few days. Will never come back."

"5.0","Thai Gourmet hits the nail on the head as far as delicious, authentic, quick Thai food goes.  Usually when I'm getting Thai food it is for take-out and the portions, prices, taste, and prompt service at Thai Gourmet keep me coming back regularly.  As far as decor goes, it's quite basic and definitely not a romantic nor trendy date spot.  I typically stick to the thai curries and go back and forth between the red curry and the panang curry.  They do Spicy level 1-10 and level 3-4 is quite spicy for even an american palate that likes spicy food.  The dinner portions are enough for two people to split and the lunch special makes for a perfect lunch as it comes with an egg roll and choice of soup and is enough to eat even if you're quite hungry.  At $6.99 for the lunch special Thai Gourmet is solidly in my rotation of lunch places."
"1.0","2 Band Experiences at this Restaurant:1. Hair in my Turkey Gyro2. A Year Later, no Turkey in my Turkey GryoIts a shame the food is tasty but after these 2 bad experiences i won't be spending my lunch here anymore!"
"1.0","This NYC kid is very disappointed. After taking a 25 mins bus ride, I walked into Coca Cafe around 1:30pm with no wait. Was given some utensils (the first set, the napkin was stained and I asked for a new one) and was told to sit wherever I wanted which i did.I proceeded to ask the waitress which beverage is better btw a mocha and caramel latte and was told the famous I don't care 'it's up to you'. Which resulted in the worst hot mocha I've ever tasted. Although I barely touched it, she didn't care to ask why. The cup with the mocha was so dirty with the chocolate running down, like seriously Pittsburgh? I ordered sourdough toast with cashew butter and banana composite and added a egg, which was really good! I then ordered a matcha latte that was ridiculously sweet, but still okay. The entree of grilled local chicken and Brie on a challah was absolutely horrible. The chicken tasted like it was boiled and simply plated with no flavor or seasoning. The combination of that thick bread stuffed with so much fig jam, easily turned it into a dessert. Finally, I don't have enough facts to say it's a race thing but I did not feel welcomed.  However, the way both waitresses treated me during my stay made me feel quite uncomfortable as though they wasn't pleased with my presence. - I'm saying this based of their interaction with everyone else in front of me. Although, I did order the most for one person sitting at the time.This resturant has inspired me to visit more areas in Pittsburgh and write honest reviews as I'm here for school, might as well see what the food scene is all about. Needless to say, I'd never recommend this place to anyone. Not even college kids based of this experience."
"5.0","I'm not sure why it has taken me this long to get here but oh man! Apparently they have $7 Morningside burgers on Sundays (bacon, egg, and cheese burger). Of course I went with that and upgraded my side to mac n cheese. Everything was delicious. Also got a flight of their craft beers. Highly recommend their Harvest Moon winter warmer. Also they play great oldies music here. Currently watching some football on TV too. Might be my new Sunday hangout. LOVING IT."
"3.0","This restaurant has good sushi but that's about it. It lacks decor and service. My family dined there on a Tuesday night and were the only people there when we placed our orders. My husband asked if it was ok to substitute two pieces of shellfish with either salmon or tuna. Waitress said it would cost $2 extra for each piece! And that the kitchen had everything prepared. What restaurant 'pre-makes' sushi!? My son also wanted a side of teriyaki sauce and they charged us .25 for it. Really? We spent over $85 for dinner and you really want to charge me .25 for a side of sauce? Your 'extras' will cost you more when your customers stop coming back."
"1.0","Customer service SUCKS!  FOOD SUCKS! I ordered nachos. Simple. They were chunked together with some type if cheese!  Makes it impossible to eat neat! This place sucks if you're an adult. Please ask me to send my bad experience video! Please!"
"4.0","Super yummy & who knew I'd love Spanish red wine?!? Oxtail & ribs were my favs!! I'd recommend doing 1 snack & 2 small plates, would be more than enough for 2."
"3.0","I should have known better than to give this place a go considering the reviews, but I figured I would try it anyways. Made a reservation for 7:30 and got seated around 7:50, that really didn't bother me though. It's got a very classic Italian looking cellar-esque vibe going on that I really dig but this place is just too small. You are constantly being bumped into by staff, without apology for your entire dinner. It's almost like bumper karts at an amusement park but you picked the kart that doesn't work and you have to sit there miserably getting slammed by everyone for the duration of your meal. Our waiter had an air about him, and wasn't very polite. No response to please or thank you, just drop off without speaking and on he went. It was all business and he probably didn't care about us because they seemed very under staffed. The bread was good, the wine was good, the salad was fine and the spinach/ricotta ravioli with tomato cream sauce was good but it didn't blow my mind. When I wasn't being slammed into with oil from my salad going all over my sweater it was almost enjoyable."
"1.0","Great staff, customer service (5/5) and great ambiance but the food was just OK. Portions were small, prices were high and the $10 chorizo platter was just cold cut chorizo with nothing else. For $10 I can pick up my own cold cut chorizo and cut it at home.  Disappointing."
"3.0","Very fast and friendly service. The food was brought out very fast. The food was alright, the egg rolls were better then the meal of general tso."
"4.0","Nice!  Really good tacos....made to order with all the toppings except the salsa.  The salsa comes in a squeeze bottle in mild, medium or hot.  Had the medium and it was standard medium; may try the hot next time.  Had the chorizo and carnitas Mexicano style.  These tacos are on par with Las Palmas and a couple of other taco stands in the area.  If you like real street tacos with fresh ingredients this is a good stop.There are a couple of tables and and awning cover them so you can eat at the table as everyone walks by on the sidewalk or take it with you."
"5.0","Nice cozy modern establishment in an old neighborhood. Service was really good, if not a bit quirky. The food was unique and delicious. However my favorite was the cocktails, my goodness they were sooooo... DAMN amazing."
"2.0","Food was okay however before we finished our dinner they prepared for the after hour club. It was loud before with a sport event and even louder after with music and moving tables and chairs right next to us."
"1.0","Terrible Delivery Service. Manager and worker seems to not understand what the customer is saying and just had a rude attitude throughout."
"4.0","Thai Gourmet is a very cute, family-owned restaurant. There's lots of decorations throughout the restaurant but it's not gaudy. Overall a nice, clean space. Service is friendly and very, very fast!Food is pretty good. I've gotten take-out a couple times and been pretty satisfied each time. The Panang curry has a nice flavor and pad thai is pretty good. Portions are pretty large. Overall, I'm quite happy to order from this restaurant."
"2.0","We went to Station for the first time this past Saturday. The restaurant was crowded. Our server was very good. The drinks were creative and really good. Our dinners were excellent. I had the Tagliatelle and my wife had the steak.  However the noise level was unbearable. It made what should have been a very nice evening into a bad one. I don't believe we will be going back."
"3.0","When I first came here I LOVED it. But with subsequent visits, the chicken just seems to be getting drier and drier. They are big portions so you'll definitely get your money's worth, but if you want some juicy chicken it can be quite inconsistent. I've tried mild, medium, and hot so far, but it seems like sometimes the medium is a hot while other times it tastes like a mild. However, the waffles are very soft and tasty -- just not great when the oil from the chicken gets soaked in there if you are saving some leftovers. I love their sauce and I think I might even like it better than my all time favorite Chick-fil-A sauce! All in all, the hype around this place is warranted because of their aesthetic appeal, drafts, and local craft beers. I definitely will try some of their beers later!"
"5.0","This is a casual hip place, a bar with a few tables along the side. I've been here three times now, and every dish I've had here has been amazingly, over the top tasty. And almost every single cocktail on their list has been delicious. They sell small plates and international sandwiches, with an emphasis on street food. Their sandwich choices are ethnically  diverse, great experiences.  Last time I was there with my wife and two sons, I ordered the Beef on Weck, a roast top round beef sandwich that was absolutely sublime. One son got the Cuban sandwich, which he loved. I've had it in the past, and it was very authentic. My other son ordered the papas rellenas, which is a Cuban version of mashed potatoes stuffed with ground beef and spices and then deep-fried. He loved it!. We shared the duck fat French fries, and we all loved them. My first time, I had the roast pork sandwich topped with broccoli rabe and provolone, and that might be my favorite! This is a really fun place for casual, inexpensive, but upscale and really interesting food. They have a moderate selection of really well-chosen craft beers on draft. Try this place! I will be here again and again."
"5.0","Food is excellent, very fresh. Ordered the pavo sandwich with a salad, their turkey is amazing. Small restaurant and gets kind of cramped but worth trying!"
"2.0","While I enjoy the bagels when they are what I order, this is the third time I have gotten home and been given the wrong bagel. I can't tell you how disappointing it is to unwrap your bagel and find out it's not what you wanted. Probably will not go back unless I unwrap my bagel every time before I leave- not something I want to do when in a rush."
"1.0","If you have a Costco membership you can also run a food truck.  Chicken taco was definitely frozen processed chicken with runny processed guacamole. Get ready to empty your wallet and cut off your socks - $8.00 for some frozen tater tots with excessive amounts of seasoning salt."
"1.0","Terrible food. Terrible service. To preface, it was a Friday night and the place was totally empty. The waitress informed us that there was a banquet going on, but we were one of the only tables in the joint. It took a long time to get our drinks. We ordered garlic bread and that took extremely long too. We asked the server about the bread when she brought our salad and she said it would be up soon and apologized. We got the bread 15 minutes after we were done eating our salad. The waitress said she would speak to her manager and get it removed from the bill. They removed it which was nice, but the bread tasted like it had sat on the line for a long time. We finally got our meals over an hour and a half after we got seated. Nothing was hot, it was all lukewarm and mediocre. We sat with empty drinks frequently throughout the entire experience also.*note: I've worked in multiple restaurants for years so I'm not an idiot customer. The place was empty so if anything the service should have been excellent. But it wasn't. And the food was even worse. If the reason for bad food and bad service was because of the banquet.. you should just close down. Literally the restaurant itself was empty. What a joke"
"5.0","In town from CA and wanted some true authentic Italian... thinking we would stumble in to a traditional 'red checkered tablecloth' kind of place...we were pleasantly surprised. Tucked in South Side, this is a gem! So quaint and vintage cool! Starting with some unbelievable cocktails...some traditional and some with a 'twist'..really great. Our beyond amazing waiter, Brian (almost positive that was his name!) was so helpful with suggestions and choices, he was just the perfect blend of attentive and professional! Had to try the greens and beans for an appetizer as it was a childhood favorite of mine....soooo good! And can we talk about the bread!!!! We  were a party of 5, so enjoyed a little bit of everything...from tuna to meatballs to pasta and it was all exceptional!!!"
"1.0","Save your credit card slips or pay cash... went there this past Friday and the bartenders added a higher tip to my card than I wrote on it! Very shady and unethical."
"5.0","Absolutely terrific food and service. General Tso's tofu is out of this world, but so is every dish we have ever ordered from here. If we didn't move out of town, this place would see us every week."
"2.0","I was not overly impressed. In fact if it wasn't for the comedy open mic night Thursday's, I'd have probably given this one star. I appreciate that they offer a venue for amateur comics to test their material. Most of them were boring, but I don't fault the establishment for that. After all, it's a free show. A bartender myself, I thought the drinks were awful. When I ordered drinks, the bartender looked like she didn't care to be there.  I get that we all have bad days; it just meant I wasn't going to bother asking her to remake my drink.  In all I ordered three different cocktails. None of them were made properly; there were multiple bartenders. I don't know if the same bartender made all of them as my husband ordered two of our rounds.  I was planning to order food but was informed by the server that the kitchen was shut down.  So I cannot say what the food is like. In summation, I would probably not return here again unless friends wanted to go. In that case, I'd stick to beer."
"1.0","Why did I even go back!!!  Thought I would give it a try since the service last three times was terrible.  It actually got worse.   We were seated upstairs and after 15 minutes were waited on.  Our taco salads came pretty quickly.    No dressing. 15 minutes for dressing as it comes from downstairs.   The server went down to get it and came back with one. He said he had the other but wanted to bring them together!!!  Seriously?   So you held one to upset us both?   The server spoke with a so called manager named Chris who didn't even bother to come to the table but took 1.90 off the salad.   LOL!!!    The server said Chris was too busy to see us.  Do yourself a favor and do not go there for lunch.   I should have just given 11 dollars to the homeless guy sitting in front of the restaurant."
"4.0","Delanie's is my favorite coffee shop in the city! It's so open and airy, with a really great selection of coffee and snacks. If you go it's a must to get a grilled cheese - The State Fair is mouthwatering. The service could be a a bit quicker, but overall it's such a great experience."
"4.0","Came here for lunch today. Overall good experience. They do get a bit busy around noon, but that's pretty much standard for most restaurants in Oakland. I ordered the Chicken Sandwich with the medium spice level and it was fantastic. Great quality chicken, with a good spice kick."
"2.0","This place is awesome you can drink in the morning if you wish. The food specials are great. But the smoking makes this a place not to go. Honestly you come out of there smelling like an ash try. I would go here a lot more often if it was non smoking but it's not and the smoking makes me sick. But they have reasonable priced drinks and great food specials, the staff is really nice and it's a fun atmosphere."
"5.0","Las Velas is awesome! Best queso I've ever had!! The food is delicious and extremely filling. We had plenty to bring home. While it is moderately expensive, you get your bang for your buck. There was also a mariachi band which was sweet. Plus they have really strong margaritas :) Two thumbs up!"
"5.0","We were hesitant to visit Redfin Blues after reading the other reviews. But I am glad that we went! The view from their deck is amazing. Our waiter was very fast and attentive. Our food was simple but good. And I thought the prices were reasonable. This is not a gourmet foodie restaurant, but the food is good and it is definitely worth it for the view! We would definitely go back on a sunny summer day."
"5.0","Visited Pittsburgh to see the Pirates game. Great pre-game meal spot. Ordered a turkey cheese steak style sandwich. We all enjoyed the meal and the baseball talk with the guys who run the place. A classic is you're heading to Pittsburgh sporting event."
"4.0","I can't believe I've taken so long to finally go to City Works. I work downtown and have heard good things about it - especially if you're there to watch a game.Our group mostly got appetizers and I ordered the Nashville hot chicken wrap. It was pretty decent! I was told it was a 7/10 in regards to spice and I'd probably say it was around a 5-6. The wrap had good flavor but also a lot of other good stuff in it besides chicken - tons of veggies. It was all mixed really well too! When I took a bite I got a mix of everything the wrap had to offer rather than biting into a ton of tortilla and lettuce. Nothing blew me out of the water but it was pretty enjoyable and I'd be down to return!"
"5.0","Azorean Café -great spot for Traditional Portuguese food and beverages before the Benfica game at Heinz Field!"
"2.0","It's a shame that a restaurant with such a great location in market square let me down. It took us about an hour and a half to be seated (there were many parties who checked in after us, without a reservation I might add, who were seated before us). Once we were seated, we were seated at a dirty table,service was slow (took about 45 minutes to get my drink) and food wasn't worth what we paid for it. Next time I am in Pittsburgh I won't be coming back. Too poor of an experience IMO."
"4.0","Very solid Thai food - better than most that I've had.  Service is okay, and the food is excellent.  I had curry, which was among the best I've ever had, and they've got one of my Thai favorites: green papaya salad.  (Someone please let me know if this isn't actually Thai.  I never had it when I was there, but I love it.  Even if General Tso's chicken isn't Chinese, I like it, too.)  Price is good, too.  With appetizers and two entrees, two people will get out of here for around $25.  The decor's a little odd: it's a converted lunch counter with some plants and Thai tchotchkies added in."
"4.0","We did all three floors at Sienna Mercato.  This one was my favorite.  We had the chef's choice charcuterie and wine, and my friends also had a pizza.  The charcuterie was just wonderful with many different flavor combos that would please any palate.  My friends enjoyed their pizza very much and said they would get it again. Service was underwhelming (on all three floors, actually). Atmosphere on this floor seemed to be slightly more upscale than the other two, though none of them were 'stuffy.'"
"5.0","I've been coming in here a lot since Shadyside Saloon closed. I enjoy chill bars where the employees actually get to know you. It reminds me of where I work, where our regulars and the employees actually probably cross the line with how close we get to our regulars. Haha. Of course, I'm kidding.Anyway, I've seen how busy the place gets on trivia night. I've also seen the place completely dead. I still love to come for breakfast on weekends, but I'm also enjoying the nightcap. It seems a lot of the bar customers are regulars. I like this, too. Conversation is more fun that way.The food continues to be good, the drink specials are nice, the drinks are stiff, and I finally found a replacement for Shadyside Saloon. Now if only Cappy's could have a dart board..."
"3.0","An Uber driver recommended this place to my friend and me. It's a small place, but you can tell it has a history (as it is the oldest bar and restaurant in town). I've only ever had the salmonburger; it was cheap but delicious. The serving was on the small side, so I would recommend getting a side with the order. Heads up: CASH ONLY. There's a PNC ATM in the square if you need it. :)"
"1.0","Good Indian food but overpriced with poor service by management and staff.They did not honor the discount provided on their menu after taking student ids and asking for orders. When we discussed the issue politely with management after finishing our meal, they responded that there was nothing they could do as their hands were tied."
"1.0","I have orderd a vegetable biriyani and thats the worst biriyani ever i had and could give a negative stat"
"4.0","Good white pizza and its nice to have an option for sicilian. Good lunch specials, just wish they would offer white slices. Definitely above average pizza shop."
"4.0","Came here for lunch with coworkers. Ordered the chip and salsa and the carnitas fajitas. Service was very friendly and pretty quick considering It was a lunch rush. The chips and salsa are addicting and our table went through 3 baskets of chips and salsas lol! Free salsa free refills by the way! And then came my fajitas. They were very very good. The meat was amazing! Tons of peppers. Albeit overall a little oily...It didn't detract from the flavor. And the pricing was great for lunch. The portion was so big I had leftovers! The seating area is nice and I never knew this place existed! Will definitely be back!"
"5.0","Best bubble tea in the city of Pittsburgh. Maybe tied for first place. It's a tough choice, but Chick'n Bubbly has jelly and bursty things in addition to the good old classic stuff. Oh, and they seal it into the cup with one of those heat-sealer things and you get to dramatically punch a hole through the lid with a pointy straw, so that's a bonus.I'm a creature of habit, can't help it (got it from my parents). I've been ordering the same beef terriyaki bento bowl from their neighbor, Oishii Bento (owned by the same people), for like 8 years, so now when I'm waiting for that order, I mosey next door and buy a bubble tea. They'll even give you 50 cents off if you show them your Oishii receipt. It's pretty much the best lunch ever. I was over the moon when they brought bubble tea next door to my favorite restaurant in Oakland, so I'm really glad they actually made it good, too.I can't say I've actually tried the chicken, but I've heard from good authority that it's great. And maybe I'll order it some day just so I can try out the awesome little finger condoms they have so you don't get your fingers all sticky."
"5.0","In my opinion, the best hand tossed thin crust pizza in Pittsburgh.  The wings are awesome if you like them crispy and sauce on the side like I do.  Hoagies are awesome too.  Everyone working is always friendly when myself and coworkers stop by for lunch.  They also have a nice little patio area in the back that's quiet and almost makes me forget I'm in the city."
"1.0","We had an absolutely horrific customer experience at Mezzo. I consider myself someone who dines out quite often. Upon arrival (we had a reservation) and asked if we could be seated by the windows as it was a special occasion for my sister's bachelorette party. Despite having multitudes of open tables by the windows we were told no that they had other reservations. The server that came to our table appeared annoyed with our presence even being there. I requested a beer off of the menu and was told that they were out of it. My sister requested a Bloody Mary, no can do. What kind of bar can't make a Bloody Mary? I've never heard of this in my life. We were then advised that we had an hour and a half time limit at our table. This specifically is what caused me to write this review. I have never in my life been told I have a time limit at a dining establishment. Not only is this a classless statement it is also one of the most inhospitable I have every experienced. Lastly, after ordering our entrees, a member of the bridal party approached the bar to order shots. She was told no to every kind she suggested and actually insulted being told the shots she was asking for were from 1980 disparaging our age group. Again, what kind of hospitality is this? She ended up going downstairs to get the shots where they were much more accommodating. I will say the food was excellent and the hostess was kind in offering friends of ours who joined us a table nearby for drinks. I am not sure that I will ever be back as the lack of customer service overshadowed any joy we had. I highly recommend counseling your staff. They are lacking in many ways."
"4.0","The food and atmosphere have definitely improved over the last two years! It's such a great environment. The food seems to be fresher and well better prepared than my first experience. Still not amazing but not bad! It gets super packed in the summer so utilize the no wait app or go for a walk while you wait."
"1.0","This place is absolute trash.  The bartender, Kimmie, is totally rude and unprofessional. She allowed a customer who I assume to be a friend of hers, to become extremely drunk and belligerent and start harassing customers. And when I decided to say something to her about it, she cut me off as if I was the problem. Like I said trash. It was dirty and I did order food but threw it out because I didn't trust it after complaining and receiving the reaction I did.  Never, have I ever been treated with such disrespect in a restaurant and I'm black lol. I will never go back to that establishment and will recommend AGAINST them every chance I get.  And to Kimmie if you see this, you suck at your job so yes I will tell you how to do it."
"1.0","Tl;dr - rude and appalling customer service I was immediately appalled by the service when my friend and I first entered the restaurant. An older gentleman greeted us, which I assumed was the manager. He asked if we had a reservation, and we didn't. He seemed to glance up and down at us, noticing that we either looked like students or weren't well dressed, and shooed us out of the restaurant saying that they were full. We were so confused because we wouldn't have minded waiting, but he didn't even give us the option to put our names down on the waitlist. Then, a few minutes later as we were about to turn the block, he came running out the door saying they had one last table for us to eat. Super confusing and rude service, and not sure I would come back again if I'm going to be judged for my appearance before dining here."
"3.0","Came here over the weekend with my wife to try some Nashville Hot Chicken. Opted for the chicken sandwich and was about to get 'Medium' when I was dissuaded by the Cashier who said the sandwiches run hot. Ordered a 'Mild' and was disappointed by the marked lack of heat... While the sandwich didn't quite have the Nashville flavor I hoped for, the sandwich was, however, plentiful, fresh, and the topped with tasty pickles and slaw. Only other complaint was just that every table was dirty and needed to be wiped down. Guess that's the sign of a popular place in a college town though. If I come back I'll up the ante and see if the flavors are more like Prince's or Hattie B's in Nashville."
"5.0","The food here is all vegan  which I loved. They definitely need more seating here especially on Sunday's for brunch. I waited maybe 15-20 minutes for my take out order at 1:45pm on Sunday which wasn't terrible. The people are really nice and patient. I couldn't make a quick decision since it was my first time there but I couldn't be happier with what I ordered. I had the Shiitake Mushroom flatbread which was so delicious. The crust had that perfect crunchiness and softness. I cannot wait to come back here again. I want to try the tofu scramble. I just wish I could reserve a table so I k is I won't have to wait too long."
"3.0","Stopped by on a rainy day for a steaming bowl of noodle soup. Unfortunately the temperature was lukewarm at best. Overall a very mediocre but passable ramen shop. The one nice thing is that they don't cook with MSG and leave it on the side for you to add at your discretion. Shoyou ramen - very greasy. I'm not sure if the broth itself was already greasy or if it was just soaking off of the fried chicken. Noodles were on the hard and chewy side and they were kind of clumped together at the bottom. Chicken tasted okay. Inferno ramen - also a layer of grease covering the soup. Brisket was made well and was very flavorful. The spice level really is pretty mild. Again, noodle texture isn't what I'm used to. Overall flavor 3/5, but the egg was cooked well. The grease on top doesn't leave you feeling the best after eating it. Would try another flavor, but definitely wouldn't be a go to place in the area."
"5.0","Our first time in Pittsburgh, just stepped off the plane and decided to venture down to the Market Square on recommendation to try this place.Friday...in Pittsburgh...lunchtime = everyone is out eating!The place was packed but we actually got seated in good timing.  The waiter was attentive and ready for our orders.  The ambiance is awesome, with tables all over, plenty of tvs and lots of excitement going on.  We are soft pretzel fanatics so we started with those, which was great paired with their cheese dip.  I had their signature chicken sandwich with fries while my hubby had their house burger and both were delicious.  We never make it to dessert, especially if we get an appetizer, but some of them we saw being brought out looked delicious.They have a ton of beer so be ready to browse the boards and pick a few out.  My hubby loves getting flights because you get options instead of having to pick just one and he enjoyed all that he got with his flight.I would highly recommend checking this place out if in the area.  You won't be disappointed."
"4.0","Ok, I finally get it. After being in Pittsburgh now for over 2 years and hearing all of the hype about this place, I finally tried it out. Delicious!After reading the menu and seeing the strawberry hotcakes, I decided to order that. I was a little apprehensive because it seemed like it was their version of a crepe, and it had strawberries, brown sugar and sour cream on the inside. Sour cream?...sounded a little weird to me. But I thought, oh what the hell. So it came out with whipped bream on top and after I took my first bite, it all made sense to me. It was delicious! The strawberries were super fresh too. Surprisingly, it wasn't too sweet either. I also got a side of bacon and home fries. It tasted like some good home cooking; the home fries reminded me of some of the best southern cooking I have had. My fiance ordered a waffle, and was far from disappointed as well.The service from our waiter was great as well. He was very gracious and welcoming, regardless that he was obviously very busy. As far as environment, I wouldn't go here if you're looking for a relaxing one. It gets quite loud and you are sitting inches away from the next table.But if you don't mind that and you're looking for some good home-style cooking, especially a good stick-to-your ribs breakfast, this place is perfect for that."
"3.0","The ribs were weak. Little to no flavor infused into them. I was really excited to try them and I held out to just have those. Waited nearly an hour and a half (mainly because we had a lot of food coming out as a party of 4) and the ribs were a massive disappointment. They were cooked well but it tasted like chewing meat just to chew meat. You'll probably like everything else they have there but maybe don't try the ribs."
"5.0","Wonderful 'Family Feast'. The flavor profiles are as good as you will find in Pittsburgh. The Oxtail Montadito was the standout, followed by the Beet Conserva, Charcuteria and Foie Blonde. Everything else was very good as well. Service was excellent. There was one misstep....the main course, Fideua de Mariscos, was served with about 25% of the clams and mussels unopened...4 clams and 2 mussels. Were they uncooked or bad???..who knows...and should it have left the kitchen that way? ?? No way. When advised, our server apologized and took those 6 back and returned with them opened. Just don't think things like that should happen."
"1.0","I'm sure this place is popular for some occasions...but certainly nothing that involves food..waited 45 minutes for 'late night eats' that were garbage. The buffalo chicken dip...by the time we got it, it was cold and had several bugs in it..wouldn't recommend this place..for food anyways..service was friendly though"
"5.0","Went here for my birthday dinner and couldn't have been more thrilled! Two words- STOLI DOLI. Our server, Rob, was amazing and couldn't have been more helpful with explaining the menu. Ordered the filet mignon and although it was a little more rare than I would have preferred, it still melted in my mouth and was overshadowed by the fact the lobster mac n cheese (minus the lobster) was perfection. One side was suitable enough for my husband and I, we ended up bringing the rest home for the most expensive leftovers we've ever had. Definitely make it a point to come here for any special occasion!"
"5.0","A delightful neighborhood cafe which is dog friendly ... great food and great beverages! We ate outside and just relaxed."
"2.0","Well I went here with my friends and my 3 year old daughter for a dinner. I ordered the chicken tender platter with a side of fries and we had some calamari. With regards to food,it's so so,I've been with few different places in Pittsburgh that really serves good enough calamari. I've from the Philippines so i know what is good and what's great in terms of calamari. Our server was ok,she checked on us maybe twice,the only thing I can say is that she didn't tell us they only take cash and they don't take cards. I've never seen it somewhere stating they only take cash. I'm a card person. I probably have a buck or two in my wallet coz I use my cards for everything. I have ten credit cards and 2 debit cards in my wallet,good thing I remember my debit card pin,made a withdrawal,paid the atm fee and gave them cash. Imagine a place that's been around since forever and they don't take cards. Are u kidding me? Even mom and pop store accept cards.goodness. I am disappointed. We own a business so I can understand the merchant fees for card transactions but hey,it's part of operating a business. The food was ok but it's not memorable."
"5.0","I love this restaurant.  I haven't been to the buffet, but have been here many times for dinner, usually before a show in the cultural district.  One of the best Indian restaurants I've been to.  The tandoori chicken tikka is excellent and so are all of the naan choices!  Prices are extremely reasonable and service is fast."
"5.0","I really enjoy Streets on Carson! Being on 12th and Carson this place is usually a little quieter and I've always had my choice of tables when there. (fun fact, they name all the tables after Southside streets... how fun is that?)There is a great selection of wine and local beers, with happy hour options. The menu is diverse and I've enjoyed everything I've tried. The main dish that will keep me coming back: arancini balls. They are so tasty and the sauce is delicious. The order can be shared, but why bother... order two for the table and have your own!"
"2.0","If you're a woman at the bar forget it.  The guy bartender gave us the nod like we'd be served in the near future but it was not true. He never served us. I listened to him and every guy he called 'bro'  and 'buddy' and all of that. Clearly not going to wait on a woman and he never did serve us a drink. Thank god there was a female bartender. She didn't want to wait on us but thankfully she did. Later in the night he drank vodka and spit it out with a lighter. Congrats, bro. This place is weird. Clearly successful because of its location. That said... we had appetizers at the bar and I liked the food. Since I thought I'd never get a beer I thought I'd never eat. But...we got our food quick and it was good!!  That's why the 2 stars. Otherwise one star."
"5.0","Awesome dining experience. Pittsburgh may not have a ton of vegan restaurants compared to other cities of that size, but B52 makes up for it with sheer quality and a welcome assault on your tastebuds. If I lived here I would be here multiple times a week!Great friendly staff, non pretentious vibe, beautifully presented food and incredibly authentic flavor profiles when it comes to middle eastern food.Love it!"
"4.0","Beta Bites is an awesome place because 1) it was literally 100 ft away from my apartment, and 2) they have really tasty, affordable food. They service is great and they have a diverse menu. My favorite thing to order is the chicken sharmola with their bomb fries. The chicken is always juicy and tender, and the bread is always fresh. I've ordered this multiple times and its always been consistent! My roommates and I love their fries, and sometimes order their fries to split when we need a quick carb-fix. I've heard their fried okra is good, but I have yet to try them. I've only ordered for pickup, so I can't comment on their delivery service, but they have a cheap delivery fee compared to other places in the Oakland area. Definitely check this place out if you want cheap and delicious food!"
"5.0","Top late-night cheap pizza in Oakland; good pizza any time of the day. And that's the truth, Ruth."
"3.0","This is a very reasonable restaurant with great service. I wasn't blown away by the quality of the food, but the quantity is in the right place. Two of us ordered two starters and an entree and left very full. I'd equate the food to Middle Eastern comfort food, a little bland, a little drab, but will fill you up every time and leave you satisfied. Also, they still have  no corkage fee, though they supply stemware and open the bottle with absolutely no qualms. Overall, this is a good standby place for eating out on a weeknight. It would be a good place to introduce your less adventurous friends to eating Middle Eastern food with its helpful waitstaff and some reliable food."
"5.0","We cannot recommend the Azorean Cafe enough, both for day to day dining and for private parties and catering. My husband and I have been patrons of the restaurant since it opened. We've loved everything we have eaten there - I am especially obsessed with the presunto breakfast sandwich and my husband loves all the seafood option - we have even tried tons of new dishes and never been disappointed. Elsa also gave us tons of recommendations for our own trip to the Azores and helped make it a huge success! This past weekend, we hosted a private party for my parents anniversary at the Azorean Cafe. Elsa was extremely easy to work with leading up to the party and made everything simple and customized to what we were looking for. She also helped to work within our budget, coming up with a menu that was delicious but also appropriate for picky and adventurous eaters alike. The night of the party Elsa and her staff were amazing. They kept the night moving and delivered on our every need. Our friends and family raved about how tasty the food was and especially the cake Elsa made. Not only that - they couldn't stop mentioning how nice and helpful she was! I can't say enough about our experience. The Azorean Cafe was the perfect place for our event and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it, order catering or have another event here in the future!"
"4.0","Went here for my birthday dinner and it was wonderful! The menu is a bit confusing to read, I definitely recommend asking your server for help. I also suggest that you order a few items to share as this feels very dim sum/tapas style. We ordered the chirashi bowl and all pieces were great and fresh) the salmon a bit disappointing however, not as soft as I'd like for it to be). The octopus balls were also wonderful and definitely unique! My favorite may have been the pork belly skewer, however. Also, the cocktails were so cute and creative! All in all, the piece at the end felt very reasonable to. While ordering it seems quite pricey but you really do get the best bang for your buck if you share plates!"
"5.0","You cant find better pizza in the southside. The best part is that you only need one slice!"
"2.0","It is reviewed as one of the best museum cafes in the nation, but I was not impressed. I can't comment on the food since I didn't try any, however I tried their iced coffee and the green juice. As the lady making my green juice was preparing the fruits and vegetables, she did not wash any of the items she was putting into the juicer and did not take the time to remove any stickers, therefore those pesky little stickers went straight into the juicer and made it into my drink! Definitely a turn-off. The iced coffee was nothing to write home about and looking around at the selection of food from other customers, the portions were small and not very appetizing. A gorgeous conservatory, but eat and drink before you spend your afternoon in the beautiful Phipps!"
"1.0","Worst customer service I've ever experienced in my life. I ordered 65 dollars worth of food.  First I tried to change from delivery to pick up and cancel the payment I already made and told them I'd pay when I got to the store.  They told me it would be too difficult to do  so I just had it delivered...an hour later our food was delivered.  I received a steak calzone instead of buffalo chicken and called them to let them know it was incorrect.  They told me they would have the buffalo chicken delivered so another hour passes and I finally get my buffalo chicken calzone.  They make me return the steak calzone which I had already had a couple bites of before realizing it was steak.  I thought that was strange because I knew they were just going to throw it away...so I think the ordeal is over and even though it took 2 hours to get my correct order I was only a little upset.  About 20 minutes later the manager calls me and tries telling me the calzone I sent back (which I tried as well as one of my friends and we both determined it was clearly steak) was the correct buffalo chicken. He then went on to blame me and say everything that happened was my fault.  It was unbelievable.  Not only did the mess my order up but then called to blame me for the entire thing.  I will never order from there again and will never recommend this place to anyone.  There are too many pizza places of equal or better quality on Pittsburgh to deal with this god awful service."
"4.0","This was a cool, yet casual, spot to spend quality time with friends. The beers (particularly the Stout options) were excellent and the food was good as well. My group had the upstairs section to ourselves, which allowed us to be together without feeling secluded from the rest of the restaurant. I just wish it was open later!"
"4.0","Nice atmosphere, delicious beer.  Haven't tried the food but looks great.  Wait staff very very nice."
"5.0","It was my first time at Stagioni and I can say that the food and service were both excellent quality. I would totally go back next time and would recommend it to anyone who's interested. The portions seemed slightly small but it turned out to be perfect portion where you don't feel stuffed. The clam linguini was slightly salty but nothing overwhelming. My family and I had mozzarella, Romaine salad and the octopus for appetizer. Salad portion was a much smaller than I expected. Gnocchis and Bolognese were superb.Kudos to our server, Rob :) Thanks again!"
"4.0","I'm not a steak eater but I love it here.  We make it a point to come here at least once a year for the Generous Pour, which is a very generous sampling of up to 8 wines for $38 with the cost of a meal.  This year there were 3 whites and 5 reds.  I sampled them all, and they were all delicious.   Then you can request unlimited refills of your favorites!  How can you beat that?!I also love the service here.  Your wait staff is attentive and friendly and very knowledgeable about the food and the wines.  I could eat an entire bowl of just the mashed potatoes.  Creamy and delicious, I'm sure they are full of butter and cream (a fact that I choose to ignore).  I always opt for a fish dish for my main course and everything is good, although outdone by the aforementioned mashed potatoes.  I also tried the cheesecake with fresh berries and it was to die for.  Believe me, it's worth the cost!"
"5.0","Fantastic!!  Absolutely loved the food here.  Dishes are packed with flavor w/ a creative spin on presentation... and certainly not like the vegan options at just any Asian restaurant. We started with dessert first of course, sharing the s'mores donut. It's really hard to find a good vegan donut, and Onion Maiden knows how to make one!  The dough itself is light and fluffy with amazing flavor (and not soggy/dense/oily like some I've tried elsewhere).  Opted for the headbanger balls and three-eyed ramen after.  Both packed with flavor and did not disappoint.  Also bought a container of house-made cream cheese to take home... so much tastier than vegan options found at the grocery store. One thing to note on restaurant itself- it's on the small side w/ tables really close to each other, so combined w/ metal music... expect a loud visit.  But that's all part of the experience!  Staff is super friendly and service is exceptionally quick.  We will def be back!"
"5.0","The place for Smile. Oh is it ever! Eat & Park really knows how to make dining a streamlined experienced. They are the classic Pittsburgh family establishment. After starting with one restaurant, they've grown into a chain that has been perfected! My families kids LOVE this place & I love Eat N Park for providing us with such a stress free dining option. The menu options are extensive. They have something for everyone's dining needs- diabetic, allergies, celiac, small portions for kids & seniors, picky eaters... it's amazing just what they've thought of! I can't think of any other restaurant in the country that offers what Eat N Park does! Our family has many favorites- just to name a few, the chicken soup is heavenly. As is the fish sandwich w mac & cheese during Lent. There are just so many choices- it really is almost impossible to review just one meal. The thing about Eat N Park is that the menu is straightforward & the calories, ingredients, and all details are readily available upon request. This makes finding a dish that suits ones individual tastes easy and exceptional. Personally, I think you can't go wrong with the hot turkey sandwich & French fries - all covered in gravy. Delicious!  So very delicious!  And we can't forget to mention the Smiley Cookies. They are iconic! Do not leave without having one if you're dining for the first time! The Smiley Cookies are absolutely the best part. Or maybe the stickies are. Or the the pies. No. The Smiley Cookies are the best... or maybe the stickies.  They are all so amazing! You might have to try them all and decide for yourself!"
"4.0","We both got the chicken sandwich, one at mild and one at damn hot (there are 5 different spice levels). The damn hot one was not too enjoyable because of the spice so always start low at a new place! The sandwiches were REALLY tasteful and filling for sure though! Mild was a good tiny bit of spice/salt. A bit slow because it got really busy at 5 pm even on a holiday! Open everyday!!"
"5.0","Had veal romano, it was excellent, some of the best veal I have had in a restaurant in years.  The pasta was also very good, I chose the Gorgonzola sauce, also very good.   The waitress was very friendly and the cost was reasonable."
"5.0","Really good Indian food at a great price. Even better if you go on a Tuesday or Thursday for samosas. Owner is super nice too! Definitely check it out!"
"4.0","HOT CAKES.  That's really all I have to say.  I was wondering what the fuss was about, and when I took my first bite, it all made sense.  As for the rest of the breakfast items, they're okay.  I ordered corned beef hash, and it seemed like the kind of corned beef that came from a can.  I could be wrong, but it just didn't have much flavor.  The only annoying thing about this place is the wait.  Get there early or be prepared to wait, outside, for a long while."
"4.0","Every time I have ordered from this store, I have never had a problem with the food. The pizza is always hot when I get there, is still hot when I get home 10 minutes later, and tastes delicious. I use online ordering because I can make the pizza exactly how I want, I get a confirmation email, and it's super convenient to access on my smartphone when I'm on the go.The only issue I have is that the cashiers often act like it's an inconvenience to them that I come pick the pizza up. I feel like they're in no hurry to assist me when I walk in. I don't trust any delivery service to get any hot food to me, and I would like to be treated a little better when I make the effort to come get my food. However, that only cost them one star because the pizza is still wonderful."
"4.0","I felt very fancy schmany being in here for lunch.  You definitely receive the the same fancy schmancy service you'd expect too.  I was just very impressed with the whole experience from beginning to end.Trying to stay on the healthy side, I was a little nervous about going to a steak house.  Don't get me wrong, I love me some filet mignon.  And maybe another time, some filet will be had... But for now I had to stay on the safe side.  The soup of the day was lobster bisque.  Darnnit! I love lobster bisque!  That was a hard one to avoid.  So... I ordered that and kept the rest of the meal light.  The lobster bisque was awesome!  A tomato base with a HUGE piece of lobster in the bottom.  NICE surprise!For the main course I ordered the scallops in lemon sauce instead of butter and sauteed greens.  It was a fantastic choice because it tasted yummy and was on the healthy side.  The scallops were a great size, seared and cooked perfectly, with a light lemon sauce.  The greens were also served in the lemon sauce, which made them equally as delicious and flavorful.  I had one tiny tiny bite of their creme brulee cheese cake and it was to. Die. For!  Seriously, if you're going for dessert, any choice is probably going to be a good one considering the choices I heard that day!  I must say again, the service was stellar.  From start to finish everything was taken care of.  The servers were extremely friendly too, and seriously seemed like they enjoyed their job and the food there.  So if you're looking for a fancy schmancy night out with stellar service and food, this is your place!"
"5.0","I've walked in front of this place so many times, I can't believe I tried this place for the first time a few months ago.  I was impressed at how authentic and tasty the food was.  The menu was extensive and everything we had was on target.  I recommend this place."
"3.0","This afternoon I went to Alexanders for lunch with some friends. We forgot that most small businesses are closed on Mondays and that's how we ended up here. I'm glad it was open. It was a nice lunch but nothing to rave about. I had a meatball hoagie, which was very tasty. My son had buttered noodles and it was a great size for a kid. He got a kids milk served in a to go soup cup with a kid. I'm having bad luck finding a place with a proper kids cup. Kind of annoying. My friends both enjoyed their meals of the Gorgonzola burger with bacon and the Gorgonzola pasta. Unfortunately, we were seated right next to the bathroom. I hate when places do that if there are spots closer to the front. I guess that's what happens when a kid is with you, I don't know. I probably won't go again, but it was decent for one meal."
"3.0","Such a cool bar, I was not really happy with the quality of the drinks and the appetizers (the dumplings) were terrible. I was so hopeful that this would become my new watering hole. As I said the space alone is amazing. Just because of the ambiance i'm willing to give it another shot. I wish I could have said better things since this seems to be such a slam dunk for everyone else. Planing on attending the music trivia nights sometime soon. Hopeful that will leave me whistling a different tune."
"5.0","Totally impressed by this place. The service was fantastic. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. We got here and it seemed pretty busy. Was totally surprised by how quickly our appetizers and entrees came out. Started with the lobster bisque fries which were pretty good, it was a big portion. The sushi someone else ordered looked great too. I had the crab stuffed salmon. The glaze on the salmon was excellent as was the kale. The potatoes were good too though a little soggy. Prices of things are reasonable, maybe a little high. Overall, really liked this place and will definitely be back."
"4.0","Great food and drinks - especially the selection on tap.  Big portions and good prices - especially for a casino joint.  Friendly staff - very attentive.  We ate at the bar.  Had the Cobb salad and ultimate nachos between two people.  Stuffed!!  Still had lots of cash to lose at the casino."
"5.0","Probably the great breakfast I have ever had in my entire life. My day is set here in Pittsburgh simply by stopping by at Pamela's. My Amazing uber driver recommended this place. He was legit. The beautiful girl who helped me gave me the greatest suggestions and I literally don't want to stop eating it. I got the mornin after breakfast special with the specialty hot cake! Oh my! You guys have no idea how amazing it is! The art work...:the art work is simply beautiful and fun and happy and just amazing. Come here! This place deserves 10 stars! They are simply amazing!"
"1.0","So disappointing how bad the service was!We went to Bettis Grill 36 on 7/7/18 for a nice afternoon on the patio overlooking the river since the weather was fantastic.  The place was empty which was surprising but then we understood why...  We were sat on the patio as requested and it took 15 minutes (not exaggerating) for a waitress to acknowledge we were there.  It took another 10 minutes for our two beers to be brought to us.  It was unbelievable how slow she was.  While we had our drink and looked at the menus, one of the servers across the patio yelled at a group of customers who moved an umbrella to block the sun.  That was enough for us, we closed our tab and went across the street to Tequila Cowboy and had a great afternoon!  Sad to see Bettis' go so far downhill.  Best location in Pittsburgh but that alone won't get it."
"1.0","After hearing about this place i finally decided to try it. Order a X-Large 18' cheese pizza around 9:06pm pick it up around 9:30 got it home and ate four slices than my friend took ate some, than finally she took another bit and boom pulled hair out of her mouth and look at the slice and pulled hair off that. She instantly spit out the pizza and put the rest in the trash. After that she looked at the box and she found another piece of hair. Couldn't call the place back because they close at 10pm.So i called today and explain it to the person over the phone that i didn't want a free pizza or money back, but just to inform them what happen yesterday and that the should invest in hairnets. He said sure buddy we will keep that in mind...... smhScared to go back there!!!!! And the person that made the pizza had long a** hair. I just feel that was a ya whatever responses. You been warned, so try at your own risk#SteelerNation smh @ this place"
"5.0","my favorite india food in pittsburgh.  everything was fresh (dinner) and nice, clean space.  you can tell the staff take pride in their establishment."
"4.0","Sausalido is a nice upscale Italian restaurant in the heart of Bloomfield.  The first thing you'll notice about this place is the relatively small space.  The layout is somewhat intimate; however, I couldn't help but be mildly turned off by the weird curtain partitioning the entrance from the remainder of the restaurant.  Despite what seemed to me as an eyesore, our experience was solid.  The menu is single paged, with limited appetizers, entrees and deserts.  Not a critique, but mostly in-line with menus of other upscale establishments.  Course by course:The smoked gouda is an absolute must-order item.  Gently fried on the outside, nice and creamy on the inside-this item was cooked perfectly and was a great way to start out our meal.  Our entrees came with salads.  Nothing too special here: just a nice blend of greens with a the unique addition of beets.  My main meal consisted of a vegetarian ravioli dish, which was savory and well-executed.  My main critique however would be the sauce the ravioli was placed in was somewhat too watery for my tastes.  A creamier sauce would have been preferable.  My date enjoyed her risotto dish, which appeared to be a great value both in terms of portion size (freaking huge), and taste-very rich, very tasty.  Desert was a fantastic peanut butter creme brulee.  Highly recommended.  Overally, this restaurant is solid.  It wasn't the most memorable dining experience, but still solid and recommended.  Service was friendly, just a bit slow and inconsistent at times.  Online reservations via Yelp are a very nice touch.  This seems like a great place to check out if you you're looking to book an upscale restaurant in a pinch.  The BYOB is tremendous with $2 corkage fee.  Perhaps one of the best BYOB values in the city."
"4.0","I had the pulled pork sandwich for lunch which was pretty good, more sweet than tangy and served on a sub roll. The sub roll it was served on was good and toppings were tasty.  I failed to order fries with my sandwich, I sort of thought they were included but I was wrong.  My bad, I failed.  The guy behind the counter realized this and threw me a box of fries for free, very cool.  The fries were really good, not typical pedestrian style fries.  These were really good fries. I will be back to this place and look forward to my next visit."
"4.0","Nothing out of this world spectacular, but they have lots of good specials, they deliver and their prices are really reasonable. After perusing a downtown hotels room service menu (which was astronomically expensive and weak) we decided to surf the net for some decent pizza, and found Genoa's. For $10 we got a good sized medium pizza delivered to our hotel within 30 minutes. Saved our night!! I would give five stars, but the delivery driver wouldn't come up to our room for some reason. He made me meet him in the lobby. Stupid. Other than that though, it was just what I wanted."
"1.0","This is my second visit. I am a bit disappointed in the price.  My first visit I ordered the omelet and it came with a side of potatoes for 9.99. I enjoyed it but, i was surprised it didn't come with toast. My second visit I ordered the two egg breakfast. Again, 9.99. Well it was not worth it. There was two pieces of bacon, the smallest piece of wheat bread and a small portion of potatoes. It is way over priced. I will not give it a third try."
"1.0","Beer great, the food was so bad I couldn't finish my meal. I think they purposely dumped tons of salt on the food there was so much. Beer is good but don't get fries unless you want it in a salt bath. Go to drink beer but not eat!Beer 9/10Food 3/10"
"4.0","Went there with a large group of people with last minute plans and was thankful to stillsnag a table without reservations on a Friday night. We came right before happy hour was over and decided to get margaritas seeing it is a Mexican restaurant. The drinks were great... And cheap! Very rarely do I think you can find fulfilling drinks that aren't overpriced in the market square, but this place has them. They paired great with the homemade chips & guacamole!"
"3.0","Are you in the mood for a fish sandwich?  Or something else that's been fried?  If so, look no further than the OOH in Market Square.  Yep, you'll be saying OOH yourself when you see the size of the fish slab you get on your sandwich.It's probably not too healthy, and their sides are a little hit-or-miss (I enjoy the mac and cheese and onion rings), but the OOH knows how to put a piece of fried fish in between two slices of bread.  There's tubes full of tartar sauce for an even unhealthier topping, and the option of chicken finger or crab cakes for non-fish lovers, but let's face it - getting any of those is a mistake.Go with the fish sandwich or - if you must - an oyster sandwich.  Anything else isn't worth the trip there."
"1.0","The first thing I want to say is that the food is good, the one star is not for the food but the service I had the day I am posting the review.I've been to this restaurant several times as I love their chicken and tea and even get the occasional takoyaki. I am always treated well by the staff but tonight, there was a young girl there that had an attitude problem. She had no patience when trying to take my order and was quick to snap at my boyfriend when he tried to order something that they were out of. I worked food service, I get it but there is saying something and just acting like customers are a hindrance. It really ruins the experience. Unfortunately, after being treated like we should be serving HER, I will not be returning here to eat. This girl should not be working there and it's a shame she ruined such good chicken!"
"5.0","Sat the bar, got okonomiyaki (pancake), bottle of dreamy clouds saki, and Budweiser. I was surprised at how hearty this pancake was, made of fish, cabbage, bacon and grilled. And a very large portion that only costs $10. Will try the whole grilled fish and whole squid next time."
"3.0","I have to say I'm underwhelmed.It's s nice place don't get me wrong but it's more hype than anything. The drinks are pricey and the food is ok. It's not awful but it's just nothing to write home about.It's packed with millennials in a cramped space. The floor plan is well laid out considering the small space. I'll probably give it another shot but if I do I won't rush out to do so."
"4.0","should've come back for its desert. When we arrived they only had banana cake with coconut milk. You can't miss pho and spring rolls here."
"3.0","I went there for dinner. It wasn't a bad place...also wasn't that great either. I've had better Indian food. Service was decent and the people were nice."
"5.0","After reading about this Pittsburg institution we had to try it! The portions are huge and get ready to run a few miles after digesting as the food is super greasy and rich but totally delicious. The strawberry hotcakes were amazing! The crispy edges of a thin pancake crepe were soooo good!!! Also we had the famous corn beef hash and it was impossible to finish, soooo greasy but full of flavor, just make sure to drizzle with hot sauce. We also ordered bacon, it was just OK so I would skip it next time. Overall this was a great diner, friendly and super fast service as well. I can see why it's so popular with the locals!"
"5.0","This place was outstanding! In town for the holiday and needed a vegan restaurant for my daughter. Based on Yelpers recommendations alone we stopped by for lunch. Had falafel with fries while kids had lentil soup, seitan shawarma and spicy kofta tofu. Everything was A+. Highly recommend this place even if you're not a vegan."
"5.0","B52 is awesome! Seriously one of the best vegan meals I've ever had in my life!My dad and I stopped in on our XC road trip to California and were extremely satisfied with our meal.The Baba Ganoush is the best I've ever had in my entire life. No exaggeration. I have fever dreams about it. I would move to Pittsburgh just for that Baba."
"5.0","I don't know why it's taken me so long to try this place out! They truly have the best pizza in town. The slices are enormous, yet thin! Somehow the pizza is incredibly cheesy even though it is nearly paper thin. I really appreciated that the crust is crispy and the dough fluffy. I would even go as far to ear it's better than pizza in NYC because they nail the crispy crust while keeping the dough light and delicate. This will really transform our pizza and game nights!"
"4.0","A perfect bowl of ramen and artisan cocktail for a cold night in downtown Pittsburg.  Tried this place in 2017 when I was here on business trip. I am so happy it is still open and still as good as I remembered it. A gem in downtown Pittsburgh. Reasonably priced cocktails that are not overly sweet with just the right amount alcohol. Staff are very helpful and friendly too."
"5.0","Even though I am only just reviewing the Coca Cafe, let it be known that I have been here probably about 10 times in the past year. Every time I want to go to brunch with someone, I take them to the Coca Cafe. My mom does the same because we love this place so much!! The food is just downright delicious, and the restaurant itself is so cute! The furniture is eclectic and the rooms are tightly packed, but the space is bright with natural light and super inviting.For food, they always have a nice variety of sweet and savory brunch options - some sort of pancake, waffle, or French toast, some omelettes, and a few other breakfast staples like eggs benedict. However, each dish is crafted with fresh, innovative combinations of ingredients, and as a result, everything is very unique. The flavor profiles in each dish are deep and rich. Despite the unique combinations of ingredients, I have never tried anything that I haven't liked! Additionally, they are constantly rotating their menu to include new specials. Sometimes, these only last for one day (for example, special dished that they craft specifically for Sunday brunch), while others are seasonal (like pumpkin pancakes in the fall/winter). Even though I've been so many times, there is always something new on the menu to try out. While the food is on the pricy side, I think it's worth it. However, it is definitely (easily) possible to spend a good $20+ on brunch, especially if you get a dish that involves seafood or one of their fresh squeezed juices. I think that it's totally worth the money, but it's certainly not the most budget friendly spot. One other consideration is the wait - if you go on a busy day (weekends), expect a long wait. In fact, if you don't call ahead/use open table/etc, you should expect to wait at least an hour. Again, I think it's worth it, but I have had to wait for at least an hour and a half before. Using something like open table alleviates this problem, but you do have to plan ahead. Also, if you do get stuck with a long wait, the restaurant is located on Butler Street, which is full of shops that you can explore to pass the time! Or, if you want to grab a coffee, pop down a block to Espresso a Mano, one of my favorite Pittsburgh coffee spots. Overall, despite the cost and wait, I will continue to go to the Coca Cafe time and time again, because you cannot beat the quality and deliciousness of the dishes that they create!"
"3.0","My coworkers and I go here all the time and take advantage of their online ordering and ready-to-go pick up. All of us ordered chicken on our salads. Today none of us received chicken on our salads. I'm very disappointed because I've always had a good experience here in the past but when you're paying extra for something and don't even receive it, it's not cool."
"5.0","This is one of my favorite vegan spots in the city. I ordered the Sietan Schwarma sandwich with fries and it was amazing. Also, the baba Ghanoush is literally to die for! I will definitely be returning. It does get pretty busy in here but the take out is just as good!"
"5.0","Amazing food. Amazing host. Khub bhalo. We got the Mutton biriyani, which was amazing. Their complimentary papad is delicious with  the chutneys."
"4.0","Love this place. Wish they had larger drinking glasses for the sangria. The sangria was good.  The portions are huge. The apple gorgonzola salad is delicious. We had cheesy bread, salad, stuffed chicken breast and seafood linguine. Loved everything. Got a gift card at Costco. $74.99 for a $100 gift card. That's my kind of deal. The place was clean and the staff is friendly. They weren't crowded we went during the week."
"1.0","Went there on a Wednesday afternoon with 10 people. There was no one on the restaurant or bar area at all. We asked to sit outside and they didn't even come to take our drink order after 20 minutes. Finally after 25 minutes we all stood up and left. Then the waitress came out and said sorry as we were exiting. This isn't the first time we have had slow service there. They acted like they don't want anything to do with a party over 4. They easily could have made 300+ on our group because we were drinking + eating and it was for a friends birthday, yet they just didn't care. Will never go back again."
"1.0","Went there today after the Pirates baseball game. Ordered the wings appetizer. They were slathered in gooey BBQ sauce to make up for the extremely dry chicken. The chips & queso tasted like the chips were purchased from the 99 cent store. Stale and tasteless. The queso was thick and gooey instead of creamy. My brother-in-law ordered a 2nd beer that took 15 minutes to arrive. I ordered a refill for my Diet Pepsi and she brought it back without ice (??). My sesame chicken salad was fairly good, but the dressing was too thick, sour/tangy and tasted store bought. We ordered a dessert to share at the table among the four of us, but we couldn't pass the dessert around because the server never removed our finished plates from the table. We had to stack them high in the center of the table. The server was nice, but did not seem very well trained. I would not recommend this place at all."
"5.0","This place continues to amaze me.Momo are some of the best things on the planet.Nepalese dishes are tasty with tons of different flavors on the platter.No frills. All taste!"
"1.0","The toilet seat was broken so I almost fell into a towering pile of my own diarrhea. Great salsa. Las Velas? I say Las Shittas. Everything is deep fried and taste old and bad. Old beer, bad chips, bad meat. Had to wash my clothes after coming home because they smelled very bad."
"5.0","I've only eaten here once so far, but I know for sure that I will be back. This place is definitely a hidden gem. Typically, I kinda hate places that have super-limited menus, because that often means they also have a pretentious vibe. A vibe that says, 'We will only offer you 5 things, and you will eat them, and YOU WILL LIKE IT.' However, Stagioni isn't that kinda place. Their menu is small and changes daily, but that's because they source local ingredients, and because the food really is that good. You will find something delectable on any given day. My boyfriend and I went for breakfast. I'd read Yelpers' reviews mentioning the French Press coffee, so naturally, we had to get that. It lived up to the hype. Our waitress pressed it right at our table, and the coffee was utter perfection -- rich, bold, and delicious. Their brunch menu had some items that fit the 'unch' part of 'brunch', but we went for the stuff that puts the 'br' in 'brunch', since it was 10am. I had the sausage, spicy potato hash, eggs, and toast, while my boyfriend had the same, only 'bacon' instead of sausage. They do note on the menu that the 'bacon' is actually prosciutto, just FYI. Our meals came out quickly. They don't fill a plate up with a large quantity of food, and that's because it's all such high quality, so there's nothing to make up for, as I quickly discovered after the first bite. The sausage was incredible -- a nice, handformed patty, perfectly spiced. The potato hash, by the way, is only spicy if you happen to put a pepper seed in your mouth, which I was careful not to, because I don't love spicy food. It was perfect potato hash, though -- every tiny cube was perfectly soft, never undercooked, and there was fresh, chiffonade basil ribbons throughout, which added kinda an unexpectedly delish touch, as well as slivers of sauteed red pepper. The eggs were over-easy, and they were delightful. It was obvious they were cooked in high quality olive oil, which lent a great flavor, and they were nicely seasoned with salt and pepper, too. There was a half a piece of thick-cut Italian bread as the 'toast', and it was really, really good. Initially, I was like, 'That's it?' but, turns out, this was the perfect amount of food. We didn't leave feeling overly stuffed, or unbuttoning our pants, as often happens at many Pittsburgh eateries (not that I'm knockin' that!). Each element of the meal was just fantastic, and they all worked together to create an extremely satisfying breakfast. I will most definitely be back for dinner. I can't wait to see what else Stagioni has in store!"
"4.0","$8 flat rate for any pizza. It's definitely a good deal. They have some signature pizzas that you can choose from or you can choose to build your own. The concept is very similar to the many fast casual restaurants that are popping up (Chipotle, Qdoba, Subway, etc.) If you choose to build your own, you get unlimited toppings for the flat rate of $8. They have numerous sauce options that you can pick from for the base of your pizza, so it makes it easy to be adventurous with your creation. The meats, cheeses, and veggies are plentiful in choices as well. They do not have a shortage of toppings to choose from! They have something for everyone here! I have eaten here a few times and I have not been disappointed with the quality of food or service. I have had a chance to have a conversation with Tony, the owner, and he is genuinely a good guy who cares about all of his customers. It's a good place to pick up a quick meal, and I plan on returning for future visits."
"3.0","This is the type of place where your non-vegan/vegetarian friends (like me) will likely feel out of place and have no clue what to order. I don't mind eating vegetarian options from time to time though, and I knew what I was getting into when we came here, so I figured I'd be all right. We had heard great things about B52 as a vegan spot.I ended up ordering the zaatar manakish flatbread, which sounded right up my alley. Having never had zaatar before, I can't really tell you if it was supposed to taste that way or if mine was just horrible, but I barely forced myself to finish it. My friend who was with me also confirmed it was no good. The pancakes she had ordered were good though. Perhaps zaatar flatbread isn't for me, perhaps mine was prepared poorly, I'm not sure, but it ranks very high on my most hated food items I've ordered.Service was good, and several other things on the menu at least sound promising, which has kept the rating up at 3-stars despite how thoroughly unenjoyable my food was."
"4.0","I was waiting my bus and starving. Than I came to yelp to check what I have near by to eat. And I found Peppis.. I entered the place and didn't get so much confidence but I ordered the subs.. IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR! a local restaurant and Amazing food! I definitely recommend!! I will be back!"
"5.0","Fresh sandwiches, salads and homemade soups make this deli a winner. They are very friendly and the food is good. I love the variety and they have daily specials. I've been eating here a while and I've never been disappointed."
"5.0","Edgar came to my work the other day and it was totally great!  I had the lengua tacos and a beef empanada.  Not only was the food delicious, the salsa was awesome too.  I always like spicy stuff and the hot salsa delivered and had a punch of garlic too."
"4.0","Came here from out of town great food great drinks and even better staff. Ashley was great and never let our drinks run low!"
"5.0","Elegantly amazing!Served promptly with a cordial smile by the hostess.Dim lighting with a prestigious ambience of a masculinely formal decor. Decadent array of selections ranging from land to sea. The seafood platter was perfectly chilled with seasonings to delight your palette. The wine menu had many choices from different regions that allowed pairing from afar to local blends. The chef selection of bone in rib eye was perfectly cooked to medium and the lamb was so tasty that there was no gamy flavoring in them. The dessert menu was to die for! I'd pick the double chocolate cake. Our waitress Katie provided great service with proper etiquette which holds high stars in my book with the use of proper verbiage of please and thank you's! Highly recommended!!!!"
"5.0","Cute and modern cafe. Reminds me of the coffee shops in Williamsburg except not as pricy and 30% less crowd. There's a nice loft where you can get more seating. The drinks are always well made and the baristas are always open to listening and making suggestions. The food options are swell as well! It can get a bit hot during the summer since they keep the storefront window open but usually it's very nice atmosphere and the artwork on the walls are so refreshing! They really gather a great collection of talent! I stop by often for a drink just to see what new art is around! I can never underrate a local shop that supports artists! Free wifi, great drinks, nice vibe and beautiful art. What more is there to want? Maybe an AC but hey I understand. Electricity isn't cheap."
"4.0","When I stopped in here, I did so without realizing they had just opened two days ago. The atmosphere is casual which I liked. You order at the counter and if you are eating in, they'll bring your food to you. Since it was a hot day, I ordered a cold brew coffee which was very good. There were quite a few coffee and tea options. I look forward to trying the casserole and hot dishes, but today was a scorcher so I ordered their tuna sandwich with a side salad. The tuna was delicious and not heavy with mayo but included tuna, eggs, potatoes, olives, and vinegar with a touch of mayo. I had it in a croissant which was delicious. The side salad simply had cucumber and chopped onion. While there was oil and vinegar at the table, I would have preferred it dressed up a bit with something flavorful. It was quite warm in the cafe though and since it was so hot today, I was looking for some respite from the heat so in that sense it could have been a little better. The service was so nice and friendly and they were very happy to answer any questions! Looking forward to trying more!"
"2.0","I was generous with a 2 star rating only because they have 2 good bartenders and its a good place to grab a quick six pack. However, the manager is rude, the food that was once decent is now terrible (I've recieved food with hair in it, and have waited over half an hour for half a dozen wings that made me incredibly sick.) Also the crowd they attract isn't a good one. It's hard to walk in to get a 6pack without someone trying to pick a fight. I try to avoid this place. Also a waitress tried to argue that creamy italian was ranch. No, it's not."
"3.0","We were very excited to try this place. I hate to say that we thought it was over priced and not the best. We both got burgers, which were $15. They were very greasy; tasty, but greasy. We also got a beer that was $9 and mediocre. I've been to many places in the city that had better food and beer and are much cheaper."
"2.0","Two and a half stars!A couple of my co-workers and I had to attend an off-site training session this morning.  As a way of saying thanks, our District Director treated the three of us to lunch afterwards.  To tell you the truth, because of all the great sandwich shops Downtown, I'd never eaten at Jimmy John's before.  Subway, Quizno's, Jimmy John's--they're all pretty much alike to me.I did opt for the Turkey Tom and on its own merits, it was a good sandwich.   The turkey was better than what you get at Subway and the veggies (sprouts, lettuce, tomatos, plus I had them put onions on mine) seemed fresh enough.  Just a couple of notes of caution:  these are 8-inch subs and although you might think a turkey sandwich is light, these bad boys still pack in over 500 calories.  And that ain't even with cheese on it.  And if you opt for the 'healthier' 7-grain wheat bread, you're bumping it up to over 600 calories."
"3.0","It's very average to me. I came here two or three times so far, and every time it is because nothing opens on a Sunday in downtown Pittsburgh. I think I ordered general tsao chicken once and lemon chicken another time. I like the general tsao chicken but the lemon chicken was so bad, I have had lemon chicken back in Taiwan. It is nothing like this, I never NOT finish my food, but I didn't finish my lemon chicken here. The service is good though, and the complimentary fried wonton is what keeps me coming back on a Sunday to be honest. :p"
"4.0","Nice place to watch boats in the river. Kids liked the boat lift. Prices just went up again but wife thinks it's worth it for crab legs. Was 40 now 45. Ace. Service is fast food good. Nice staff quick and attentive"
"4.0","Best place to go to get an amazing Philly cheesesteak sandwich!!!! Whenever I come to area, I always come here. Override a few different places but this place stands out amongst the rest!"
"5.0","Wonderful pizza and nice staff. Pizza is crispy and delicious. Wings are Alonso really good and covered in sauce."
"5.0","Love the atmosphere and the creative drinks they make - whiskey selection is good, and their beer selection is moderate but good choices to pick from (not a bunch of domestic boring beers haha). You can play board games and card games here, and it's open when it's nice out so it's nice and breezy. Great place."
"3.0","Not impressed with the burger. Bartenders were not friendly to bar customers. A few decent cocktails. Food is hit or miss."
"3.0","If your looking for a slice this place is nice.  You get a piece that takes two plates.  The pizza was good.  The dough was pretty good but my piece probably needed a couple more minutes in the oven.  It is a thinner crust but puffy on the edge. The dough had a nice taste but a little under done."
"5.0","Went in to kill some time while waiting for a table at Fathead's, and ended up loving this place!  The upstairs seating area was quiet, with comfy chairs, and a cool exposed brick wall.  The staff was very friendly.  The coffee was on point!  I had a caramel latte that blew away anything I've ever had at a chain place, and most of the local places I've been to as well.  Will definitely stop back next time I'm on the South Side."
"4.0","Pamela's was just going to be too much for us so we took our friend's word on Coca Cafe. The menu was diverse, seasonal ingredients and fresh. For a Saturday morning, it was really busy, naturally. We had called ahead and our party still had to wait at least 30 minutes outside. Brisk, but sunny - we gathered around until our large party was able to be seated. The interior of this restaurant is cottage like, quaint and tight fitted tables and chairs. Best suited for a party of two, rather than a party of six. If it weren't for the blackboard special that caught my eye, I would have ordered the Eggplant Benedict. The special was a plate of fresh corned beef hash (shredded and with gold potatoes), two perfectly sunny side up eggs, and piled on top... lightly fried pieces of kale. This dish was savory heaven. Others in our party, ordered the goat cheese stuffed french toast (whoa!), pesto omelette, shrimp and grits... All looked wonderful. We traded bites of things, and nothing disappointed me."
"3.0","It's neither here nor there.  Bottom line - it's sustenance for your body.  I had the chicken noodle soup and it was 'A-OK', not great, not even that good, but it did the job - made me full.  It was inexpensive which was a positive.  I think a bowl of soup costs $3.10.  The one thing I will mention is that it definitely seemed homemade in that there was shredded chicken instead of cubed chicken pieces that are sponge-like and marginally taste like chicken.  There were also carrots, spinach, and onions - and of course noodles.  So while I was not overly impressed or dramatically disappointed, I did feel like it's a healthier option than some of these other lunch joints dahntahn."
"2.0","UPDATE:The management at Prince of India has since reached out to me and said they have made some positive changes as a result of my experience. They have invited me back free of charge to give them a second try. I am willing to take them up on this offer, but I am not sure when my schedule will allow it. That being said, I feel it is important to mention that they took this step to provide excellent customer service. In the meantime, I'll add a star."
"5.0","This is the most delicious food in Pittsburgh. So good, we even had them cater for our wedding. Favorites include: Chili Chicken, Chicken Tikka Masala, Falafel, and oddly, their fries! So good!"
"3.0","Is Bruegger's the most delicious, fresh bagel place ever? No. But, in Pittsburgh, where there are very few bagel places, this is some of the best you're going to get. They have a wide variety of bagel and cream cheese flavors. They also have a lot of sandwiches that go beyond your basic bacon, egg, and cheese, which I appreciate. This visit, I got the western. The fresh bell peppers and chipotle sauce on the sandwich elevate it. Overall, Bruegger's is a great place for a quick, cheap, hangover-curing bagel sammie that's a step above a traditional fast food breakfast."
"5.0","Three things you should know:1.  IF I HAVE A PULSE, I WANT TACOS.2.  This is the taco stand around the corner from Reyna's.  3.  After writing I got so excited for tacos I rescheduled a work meeting to get tacos.THESE ARE THE BEST TACOS IN PITTSBURGH.  Not Casa Rasta (barf), not Reyna, not the Pgh (I Hope You Like Waiting in Line for Underwhelming) Taco Truck.These.  Right here.  So good.  I dont mess around when it comes to tacos.  These are the ones you want.  You dont have time for lousy tacos!The last time I was there it was the ground beef tacos (2 for $5), and a crab meat empanada.  It was so good, I ordered a second order 'for a friend,' and then went around the corner where they couldnt see me and ate the 2nd order.Everything is so fresh and they make tacos the way I would , if I could make awesome tacos.  Cilantro, lime juice, queso fresco....  Okay I need to go get tacos.You need tacos too.This is the best cheap lunch in the Strip District.  And the guys who make the tacos are just...so friendly and funny--they are straight up delightful.   What a strange way to describe someone.  They're really cool guys.  The other day I went to get tacos and the chorizo special he was cooking smelled so outrageously amazing I told him, 'If I could cook like this, I might finally find a husband!'  He made sure I watched him make it so I would know how.  What a sweet guy!I like giving them my money!"
"5.0","One of my favorite breakfast spots. Looking forward to the opportunity to eat on the upstairs patio on a busy Saturday Strip District morning"
"4.0","Stopped by here today for their Oakland Restaurant Week lunch special: $6 for one trip (one plate) to the lunch buffet and drinks cost extra. Dine-in only!! I've always wanted to try this place and I finally chose today to do it.I came in around 2:00 and it was 3/4 empty, so I was seated and received my water really quickly. The server was really nice and courteous. The food was really good! The lunch buffet selection is small, but they had all the popular dishes. All of the curries were really delicious and flavorful. The rice was cooked really well. The veggie pakora (?) was old/over-fried because it was hard and really dry. And there was only one piece of naan bread left when I went up (which was also hard and dry), which was really disappointing because naan is my favorite part of Indian food but I didn't want to bother waiting for it to come out and/or possibly getting in trouble because I was only allowed a trip.All in all, I think the food is really good but I don't think the restaurant week special was really that worth it. For a few bucks more you can do all-you-can-eat option with a drink included and a discount if you're a student or UPMC employee. I would definitely like to come here again in the future."
"4.0","Mitchell's has upped its game adding a 24 tap system, with 20 rotating crafts.  The prices are reasonable for a downtown establishment and a great place to go if you are parking and walking to an event at Consol, or hopping the T to HeinzField or PNCPark. They also hired a new chef, he is formerly of the urban tap, and brought a new and inventive menu with him.  The classics that Mitchell's was famous for are still here but the menu compliments the changes they made that the front of the house. One final note. The bar area is non-smoking during the day (great for business lunch or happy hour ) but becomes smoker friendly later in the evening. Highly recommend Mitchell's"
"5.0","I loved my experience at Stagioni this past weekend, and everyone in the party agreed! I highly recommend!The dining room was nice and quiet with warm lighting and floral accents. We asked for cocktail recommendations, and the server did a nice job of asking about our preferences and recommending appropriate options. We decided to go heavy on the appetizers, as there were so many delicious options. This was definitely a good choice! The made to order mozzarella was fresh and creamy. My first bite of the cheese alone was good, but once I added some of the fresh salt and swirled it around in balsamic, it was perfect! The roasted brussel sprout salad was a surprise - we all expected full brussel sprouts - but in a good way! It was loaded with parmesan cheese, and the hazelnuts were a really nice touch. The roasted figs stuffed with goat cheese and wrapped in bacon were definitely our favorite appetizer - we fought over who was going to have the last one!We also shared a pizza and two pasta dishes.The Artichoke etc. pizza had the perfect amount of cheese with a deliciously crisp crust. I love gnocchi but never had it with ricotta - will definitely try that again! The pappardelle was cooked perfectly al dente and had a nice orange flavor. The port currants were an excellent addition. Our sever was very attentive and, even though we were the last table in the dining room, we never felt rushed to leave. Excellent all around experience."
"5.0","Their catering trays are the best I've ever had! I loved everything. It was all fresh and tasty from the salads, moist chicken with spinach, strawberries, etc., grilled bread...so good!"
"4.0","I have really enjoyed this place. Believe the spice ratings and when the person at the counter tries you to tone it down, don't be a hero. Listen to the warnings. This is a great change up from the other offerings in Oakland. While they have sweet tea, they are missing a brewed unsweetened tea option."
"5.0","Great Chicken and good portions! I discovered this shop in Yelp after seeing Popeyes was closed and CHiKN was just around the corner. I ordered the 3 piece chicken tenders with a mild spice level and it was a decent portion size! I was definitely full by the end of my meal. The tenders were seasoned to perfection and the fries were good and warm. I am not a spicy person but the mild was just right for me and I probably could have gone up a spice level for an added kick. Service was pretty quick and the prices were reasonable in my opinion. Highly recommend if you are looking to try a new spot in Oakland other than the major chain spots."
"5.0","My friends and I looove coming here. Whether for happy hour or after dinner drinks. We've done birthdays and other celebrations here as well and ALWAYS have a wonderful time. One time there was a totally creepy dude we caught trying to take pics of us and the security team (Dan, Christina, and Cody) took AMAZING care of us. They kept an eye on us all night and even walked us out at the end of the night to make sure we made it home okay. I love coming here and I love the staff. Favorite  bar in Pittsburgh!"
"4.0","I've been to Las Velas too many times to count. This is my go to spot to take friends for the BEST queso in Pittsburgh! It's a hidden gem in Market Square. It's above Diamond Market so it's sometimes overlooked by newbies to Dahntahn. Stopped in last night for HH before the Pirates Game. Staff was attentive and friendly as usual. The only drag is that there always seems to be a delay at the bar. Drink refills take a while, which is not a plus during HH. I want to get the most for my money! My friends and I ordered the following:Large margaritas- two strawberry, one regular, and one mango cayenne. All delicious! The mango cayenne is my favorite and talk about a double whammy punch to the tastebuds. The alcohol in the margs is strong so along with the plentiful addition of cayenne pepper, it's a poweful hit to the senses. Chips, queos, gauc and salsa. The chips were a different variety this time (that's how often I go there- I even know the chips! ) They weren't the fresh cut & fried corn tortillas. They seemed like the type of bagged 'authentic mexican chips' I hope this isn't a permanent change to the menu! Queso was amazing as always, gauc was fresh with huge chunks of avocado and salsa was mild and refreshing. Even though we didn't need it (chips and dip is filling!) we ordered two quesadillas, stuffed jalapenos- stuffed with fresco cheese, ground beef, chorizo and drizzled with tamarindo honey sauce and one order of Sopecitos- 4 corn tortillas, topped one each of chicken, steak, chorizo and carnitas and cheese. The stuffed jalapenos were each large and lit my mouth on fire. Well done, Las Velas! The rest of the food didn't dissapoint... my go to is usually the Sopecitos! Once again, Las Velas was a great choice and I'm sure I'll be back soon!"
"5.0","Visiting Pittsburgh last weekend, this is the first place I had to try. Mainly because of The 7 aka 'The Roethlisburger'. I may not live in Pittsburgh or anywhere near it, but being a Steelers fan, Pittsburgh is definitely a part of me. Walking in this place, you're greeted by at least 4-5 employees while you check out the big board/menu. When you're ready to order, you order, take a seat, and they bring out your food not long after. I ordered The Roethlisburger along with an order of Onion Rings. The sandwich came with american cheese, sausage/burger, and egg as the primary ingredients. I told them to put everything on it so it came with tomatoes, lettuce, and I believe a few other things. I wish we had sandwiches like this in Louisville. From the bread all the way down to the smallest ingredient... the sandwich radiated freshness. The onion rings were fresh as well. Definitely the type of onion rings that have started disappearing over the years... the kind you bite into and with the bite you sometimes pull the onion out with your bite.I could easily make this place a regular stop if I lived in the area. My only complaint & I won't take off a star is they only take cash. Luckily they have an ATM inside, but keep in mind that it's cash only. I understand why businesses do this, but if I was going to open a business... I'd take card, cash, bitcoin, whatever payment that someone wanted to give me. Since I don't live in the area, I can't become a regular, but I will make it a point to visit everytime I'm in Pittsburgh."
"4.0","My husband and I stopped into Redbeard's for a night of college football. We had to wait for a table and decided to get a drink at the bar. There were no spaces, but we were happy to learn that there was another bar upstairs with ample standing room. I ordered our drinks, which were okay-mixed cocktails but was pretty astounded when I got the bill. 21 bucks for 2 mixed drinks. A little much for a sports bar, no? However, Redbeard's downtown seems to have upped its game from its Mt. Washington location. It is definitely a bit more trendy feeling, which was fine, but that comes with a price tag. The bars have a ton of big screen TVs, which made it very fun and easy to watch multiple games at once.We finally got seated and ordered our meals. They were very careful about my food allergies, which was great. The manager came over multiple times to make sure our meals were to our liking and allergen free. Wonderful customer service!The food was pretty damn good. I got a bowl of the chili, which is homemade (and free of top 8 allergens!) and the steak salad. They fry in soybean oil, so avoid that if you have the allergy. My husband got dry-rubbed cajun wings and loved them. Our bill was reasonable for the food, so that was a plus. Just be wary of the high drink prices!"
"4.0","Skewers are good.  Sushi is pretty good but not best in Pittsburgh.  A bit pricey compared to competitors with smaller portions."
"3.0","I'd been wanting to try this place for a while! This was my first ramen experience EVER. I think I overestimated my liking for ramen. Don't get me wrong - everything was very good, however I don't think ramen is as a flavorful as I expected. If this is your first experience with ramen I'll warn you the menu is hard to navigate. I wish I asked for a recommendation, but instead went with the Miso Ramen with fried chicken. I could have done without the friend chicken. Maybe the pork would have been better. Overall just OK. We also had the edamame and goyza. Both were fantastic! I never say edamame is good and this place blew me away. We also ordered drinks which we were pleased with. Nothing spectacular.If you're looking for ramen in Pittsburgh I'd give it a try. They have lots of options and the space is great. I'm anxious to try some other ramens in the city and see how it stacks up."
"2.0","I was not a fan of Hardee's at all! The advertisements are what dragged us in with the hopes of a huge, quality burger as advertised, but we got mediocre food at best. I got the curly fries, chili dog (~$5.99 combo) and the chicken tenders (~$9.99). The chicken tenders were chewy and did not taste or look as though they were 'hand breaded.' I didn't like the honey mustard dipping sauce. It had a heavy taste of Dijon mustard and a hint of horseradish. The curly fries were not good and didn't compare to other fast food curly fries. The hot dog was salty, cheap tasting and the chili on it was over processed and looked like dog food. The staff was friendly and the wait wasn't long, so nothing but positives there, but I would not be visiting Hardee's again due to the lack of taste for the prices we paid."
"4.0","Cool, chic village NYC vibe and crowd.  It's a nice more laid back lounge vibe option from the other restaurants and bars on Mount Washington. They also have a stunning painting behind the bar which deserves your attention.  Message me with your thoughts on it!"
"4.0","Definitely a great place for interesting and a different take on ramen! I got the Inferno, and it had a palatable heat level with a very deep flavor profile. The brisket included in it was tender and delicious! This will be a return dinner location for us."
"4.0","Went on the Fourth of July for drinks. The place had a good vibe and we took advantage of the shots wheel. The security were very nice to us at closing time, and the drinks were well priced. I'll definitely be coming back here my next time in Pittsburgh :) the girls bathrooms were horrible, but that's hard to avoid, and the security guys were very cool about us using the guys bathrooms before close haha."
"4.0","An excellent Japanese restaurant tucked into Station Square. The food and service were excellent. They have created a great ambiance of a Japanese restaurant as well."
"5.0","The sweet potato chips are the best ever. The specials on any given day of the week will be most delicious and inexpensive. Love the salad and the house dressing. The vegetarian sandwich is the bomb, so is the beef sandwich. I'd pretty much motor boat that entire menu if I could."
"3.0","I do like Frank's a lot. Their buffalo chicken pizza is good. But not amazing. Their ranch is super good. Breadsticks are actually my favorite thing. They also have really good fries with bacon and ranch 'Frankie fries' are so good! Like amazingly. But sadly, where we live they don't deliver. Which were less than five miles away. Actually I believe were within a 3 mile radius. I'm not sure why they won't deliver but that's definitely a huge let down."
"5.0","The best breakfast in Pittsburgh!  The line is shorter than Deluca's and the food and service is so much better."
"5.0","This little spot nestled near the corner of the Walnut street is a charming Italian restaurant with ambiance and a great wine list."
"5.0","Wonderful experience last night at Morcilla.  The setting was beautiful.  The chandeliers are wrought iron, and the wooden walls make a cozy setting.  The service was really wonderful.  Our server was super helpful with the menu, and attentive.  We were a large party and ordered a bunch of dishes to share.  Highlights include the pulpo, the ribs, the pig feet/head croquetas, bacalao and of course the churros.  Really enjoyed our dinner there last night and looking forward to returning soon!"
"5.0","I can't speak more highly of our visit to the Capital Grille last night! We have eaten here maybe 7 times now and I have never been to a more consistently hospitable restaurant. To preface, I spent 10 years in the service industry and would consider myself to have high restaurant standards compared to others. My family and friends hate eating with me because I know what good service is and expect it (as should anyone paying to have a meal prepared and served to their liking). Now that you have the flavor of what kind of restaurant snob I am, let me tell you why The Capital Grille deserves five stars...When we arrived for our reservation, we were politely greeted and promptly sat. I saw the sign for their HUGE wine event and as a non drinker immediately thought 'ugh, I hope they don't hate us because we aren't planning on drinking.' While our server was still with her other tables, our waters were filled, an iPad to browse wines and desserts was offered and bread brought to our table. When our server Katie, whom I have never met, made it over to our table she warmly greeted us like we were regulars, using my name from our reservation. From there she fielded our questions and took our order.On her recommendation, I ordered the surf and turf which consisted of a Filet and African Lobster Tail (I had only ever had the Maine tail), the hubby ordered a Filet and of course we ordered the Lobster Mac to share. To start we had a crock of French Onion soup (truly the best I've ever had) and the wedge salad (always good until I remember how much more I like the soup) that we shared. I was almost full before our meals came!Our meals arrived, the presentation gorgeous, so excited to eat the biggest lobster tail I had ever seen! I cut into my filet, slightly undercooked but delicious. I'm a medium rare kind of girl so I'll take under vs over any day and I wasn't overly concerned because I had the huge tail and I could take the filet to eat the next day :) The hub's filet was cooked to perfection and the Lobster Mac was steamy and delicious as it always is. Now the tail... It was beautiful and from Africa so I couldn't wait! To my disappointment, it had a really fishy taste to it :( since I've never had an African tail before and had nothing to compare it to, I wasn't going to say anything. Katie came over and could tell I didn't love it. I didn't want to make a big deal about it but within minutes she had whisked that away and came out with what I know and love- the Maine tails. I was so impressed and my tastebuds were dancing with delight! After we were stuffed with deliciousness our table was cleared and scraped to the cloth. Katie presented us with a gift from the restaurant- a beautiful arrangement of 2 of their desserts and berries on a plate that had 'Just Married' written in chocolate sauce. Not only was it so incredibly thoughtful and beautiful, it was delicious! We were so excited and felt so special!If that wasn't enough, at some point during our meal Katie had asked us if there was a reason we weren't drinking and I shared with her that we just don't drink alcohol at all. I assumed she wanted to talk wines with us but she was respectful and that was it. After our dessert was cleared, she brought us over non-alcoholic sparkling soda with sorbet in martini glasses so we could have something to toast our wedding over!!! What an incredibly thoughtful gesture!!!!Our visit was last night and as I am writing this review today, I know this will be an experience we will remember forever. Some of these reviews talk about the weird decor or overpriced food but I promise you there is no dollar amount you can put on making your guests feel like they are the only ones there and that all you want to do is make them happy. My 5 stars clearly include the service, quality of the food, cleanliness of the restaurant and bathrooms and overall experience. Thank you Capital Grille for a night to remember. I look forward to our next visit :)"
"5.0","There aren't enough words to describe the love we have for this restaurant  We came to Pittsburgh for a couple days for a concert back in late spring early summer... we looked up different Italian restaurants in the area to go to. After seeing pictures of Girasole we decided to try it. First off, the surrounding little strip of shops is adorable & perfect to walk around in before or after you dine. As we came upon the restaurant I instantly loved it! It's very similar to reading in NYC when the restaurant is in the bottom floor of a brownstone. We went inside & it's perfectly cozy & smells amazing! The owner is either walking around making sure all is running smooth & above is happy or sitting at a table by the door to greet everyone coming in or on their way out. I can't exactly remember what we had to eat at our first experience here, but I do remember it was delicious! We couldn't wait to come back. So we came again to see Andrea Bocelli a couple weeks ago & Girasole did NOT disappoint again... we started with the meatball appetizer which was SOOO delicious! Then we got the Mezza Rigatoni which, oh my goodness, was to die for delicious & the steak dish with mushroom risotto & asparagus, again oh my!! This place will forever be worth the drive from Buffalo... it's probably good we don't like close lol! Keep up the amazing work Girasole, you have the best Italian food around!"
"5.0","Absolutely first class food. I had lamb rogan josh and onion nan. I think this is the best I've ever eaten. As I walked through the door I nearly turned around as decor isn't great but then I noticed every single person was Indian. Good sign and they were spot on."
"1.0","I was lured in by a sign on the sidewalk depicting a type of green tea cake that looked super yummy. They didn't have it so I ordered some 'asian buns' (which were beef steam buns or bao) and a 'bubble green tea' I watched them microwave the buns, which were not awful but they weren't even as good as the ones you can get in the trader joe's freezer section. It's 92 degrees outside and they brought me a warm (not hot, not cold, certainly not iced) boba tea that tasted like perfume. My server was rude. The fortune cookies they brought us were already open. Not worth it, won't return."
"1.0","Very disappointing, fun atmosphere but food wasn't any better than a a fast food Italian restaurant. We started with the trio appetizer, the first time it came out everything was cold. Second time, the calamari was overcooked, the mushrooms had been warmed up in the microwave and were like hot lava and the fried cheese was still cold. The salad was a big bowl of lettuce and red onions, eggplant parm was over cooked and could not be eaten, shrimp fra diavolo was so spicy we couldn't eat and the pasta was undercooked.All in all the food was not good , and will not visit again"
"4.0","On an unsually cold May night which Penguins happened to play , during my very first visit to Pittsburgh while I was walking toward my hotel I walked by this place , it's hard to miss it because of big bright signs they have got outside .1st thing caught my attention was people smoking inside ! If you want to know more about smoking law in pittsburg you can check out : http://www.no-smoke.org/goingsmokefree.php?id=161It's an old but very cool local. I sat at the bar and ordered a beer from tap ,beer showed up and it was cold enough! That is why I am giving them 4 stars .I had a burger , it was great . My waitress was very friendly and good at her job .If you happen to stay in station square arwa you should check this place out ."
"5.0","Remarkable food, great service, and quality beer. Cinderlands is packed for a good reason, this is a good place to go for wonderful food and a fun evening.The booths create a fun personal space. If you want to watch a game you can sit at the bar, but otherwise, the screens are not obtrusive. The food is creatively prepared and everything is rather delicious. For example, the apple and smoked goat cheese in the Brussels Sprouts made it a tasty combination. Our server knew the menu quite well and was able to make helpful suggestions.  My only criticism is there could be a few more vegetarian entrees.  There are several veggie sides, enough to make a meal, bit nothing much to choose from on the entrees without making substitutioms. Cinderlands is a place to keep coming back to."
"5.0","This place was so good!  We came on a very cold Monday so there weren't many people there.  We sat at the bar.  My boyfriend and I both got cocktails and both were really good!  We ordered the spring rolls and fried chicken ramen (it's under another name of course).  The ramen was amazing!  The flavor was great and on such a cold day it was the perfect thing to warm my soul.  The spring rolls were pretty standard spring rolls which I can't complain.  Staff was nice.  Atmosphere was good.  I can't wait to spend more time here this winter to eat all the ramen!!"
"3.0","I got a Bulldog, which is a kielbasa with saurkraut and spicy brown mustard. Unfortunately, the kielbasa was relatively tasteless. They have a lot of different bottles of beer, but I couldn't find many local beers. The beers on tap were not local beers, but were nationally available. So in the end, this place is relatively generic and unexciting."
"1.0","I ordered from Beta Bites through EatStreet since the Yelp reviews were good and I had a coupon.Worst mistake ever. Right from the beginning, the order was a disaster - the delivery guy made me walk across the block because he refused to get out of the car. It was freezing cold and all I had on were socks. He handed me the pizza through the passenger window and drove away without even an apology.I ordered their verdure (veggie) pizza which is supposed to be topped with 'marinara sauce, spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, banana peppers, roasted red peppers, mozzarella and provolone.' There were maybe 6 slices of tomatoes and a minimal scattering of spinach, banana peppers, and red peppers. I think there were all of 5 mushrooms on the entire medium pizza.On top of the lack of veggies, the pizza was awfully greasy. Even after patting down each slice with a napkin, I had difficulties getting through all of the oil. And the cheese - besides being tasteless - would not stay on the slice. I found myself picking up oily globs of cheese that had fallen off the soggy crust.Probably the worst pizza I've ever had in Pittsburgh.For the price, this place's pizza is DEFINITELY not worth it - you're better off going to pretty much any other place in Oakland."
"1.0","Two out of three sandwiches were totally wrong and the one they got right was bland AF. I'm pissed I paid $50 for sandwiches I don't even want. Terrible."
"4.0","Small and easy to miss place in the heart of Little Italy. BYOB with a reasonable $2 corkage fee per person resulting in an inexpensive evening.Entrees are in the $20-$26 range an include a salad and a wonderful white bean/balsamic/rosemary dip with bread cubes. Actually, I think all of us would have been content to forgo entrees and have a glass of wine and enjoy the bread and white bean dip, which appears to include unlimited refills.That said, the entrees are varied including trout, duck, porkchop, risotto, crab cakes. Many dishes included brussell sprouts, which two at our table aren't enamored with and were easily substituted for other accompaniments.The person at our table with the gluten allergy found the waiter able to offer many choices to meet her needs. Definitely food-allergy friendly.Service is fine. A bit noisy until the owner turned down the Lionel Richie music upon request.  Portion sizes were reasonable and everyone enjoyed their meals.Not five stars, but a solid four star entry in Bloomfield.As an aside, we miss D'Amico's."
"4.0","$23B or not....Buffett putting it in his pantry or not....we like Heinz's canned beans for beans n toast ( beany burp). Just had for brekky with sourdough toast.It is simplicity in a can. Thumbs up for that profundity:)"
"4.0","We went early on a Sunday and it was pretty empty. The staff was friendly. They had a good range of beers and they offer a flight of 4. The fried chicken sandwich is a good alternative if you don't want a burger but their fox chapel burger is delicious. It's a mixture of beef and mushrooms but mushroom lovers won't hate it bc you don't really taste them. The goat cheese is creamy and the balsamic gives it a great taste. Mac n cheese is not really worth it, so order the rosemary fries!"
"5.0","I love this place. Good food, decent drink prices, and different things going on throughout the week. The people who work here are always so friendly even when it is packed. Good place to stop for lunch or stop for a few drinks on a Saturday night!"
"5.0","I finally stopped at the Green Front Inn after driving past countless times. The food was amazing and the waitress was super friendly and attentive. A good variety so you have lots of different selections to choose from. I got the hamburger which was delicious and my bf got  the fish sandwich. It was HUGE! Can't wait to go back and try more of the menu. I would have liked to get dessert but I was stuffed. There's always next time!"
"3.0","Wait until dark!Always my favorite Resturant.  Still great food.'The wait I until' remark was because our reservations  was at 5:30 and it was still light outside.  This Pittsburgh location needed a little lower light.  The carpet was worn and faded and looked 100 years old.  In the evening light all the wood work looked dusty and in need of a do over.I also missed the placing of the napkin on your lap and the constant water filling attention you used to received.Price was the same but this Ruth's Chris experience was not up to expectations !Oh, and my wife never received her dessert from the 'special'Sad!"
"4.0","Loved it! I was not too excited about trying to eat healthy at an Italian joint, but went with friends. I was impressed at how many healthier options they had, if that's what you're in the mood for. Or pig out on a hot plate of carbs and dairy with a side of italian sausage.My friends and I split an order of beans, greens and tomatoes. I regret the sharing part, it was so outrageously delicious I wanted it all to myself. Next time I'm getting my own.In the spirit of healthy eating, I went with a salad, which was big, fresh, and just what I wanted. If you like salad, you're set. If not, the pasta my friends had looked great too. You can get gluten free or whole wheat pasta for an additional charge if you like. My boy friend had angel hair with alfredo, our friend had linguini marinara with fried calamari.The waitress was very pleasant, and kept her cool even though she had the pleasure of serving this merry band of drunk, vicious old queens.Now I would have been sold on the service and the food, everything I tasted was great. But the two pasta dishes weren't all that hot. Somewhat warmer than warm, they said. My friend let the waitress know but wasn't unhappy enough to send it back, even though the manager was adamant they could remake  the plate in no time. (I work in a customer based industry and I know first hand, nothing can be worse than an unhappy customer who isn't willing to let you fix the problem after they bring it to your attention.) So at the end of the meal, he offered to buy us a round of drinks instead. Smart guy - offer a couple of drunks some free liquor, and all is forgiven. He took an almost great meal and made it great for them. Sadly, I was driving so didn't take him up on the offer. So - great food, beans and greens, lots of choices, beans and greens, good service, and beans and greens. If it were closer to home I'd be ready to move in."
"5.0","Legit amazing. Don't listen to the doubters. If you don't like it you're a bitch and can't handle life or food"
"3.0","So I'm reading the previous reviews... and Buca di Beppo is a little gem?! I'm not sure I agree with that. First of all, it's not little. Secondly, it's a pretty decently known chain restaurant, so it wouldn't really be a gem in the sense that it is something to be discovered. Either way, this chain does have its value. Buca has become a regular place for celebratory dinners with my co-workers. We've been here a few times, but only on weekdays when it is pretty empty and easy to get a big table. The prices are pretty fair for a big group, especially after you split the meal, the drinks, and the check. The family style meal is also really fun for a big group. I like that it is a casual restaurant that allows for a dinner group to be loud and rowdy. As for the food, you can definitely find better and more unique Italian food at other restaurants. At Buca, the food is just mass produced on big plates so that everyone can eat like a family. Everything I've ever tried is good enough. Oh, and definitely get the sangria... it adds to the fun night for sure, plus it's tasty."
"1.0","If it wasn't for the tasty bagels I would never go to this location. Look at my sandwich....how do you expect me to pay almost $4 for something like this? What a joke"
"2.0","The last two times I have dined at Capital Grille's Pittsburgh location I have been rather disappointed with my meal, and this past time, not only was my meal horrible but the service was inexcusable especially at this price point. We came for a birthday celebration and it also happened to be restaurant week. Receiving our waters was by far the fastest and friendliest service of the night, mind you this person was not our server. our actual server eventually brought out our bottle of wine, a Malbec, which was enjoyed by all. All five of us ended up ordering the RW menu. The appetizer choices were: clam chowder, wedge with blue cheese and bacon, or Caesar salad. The Caesar salad was my choice and, unfortunately besides dessert, was the highlight of the meal. Oh, and the Asiago/onion bread. Those two items tied for second best of the night. For entrees, I chose the 8 oz. filet medium rare. Others in my party chose the krona crusted ribeye for an extra $10. Our server did not deliver our food or check on us at any point. Upon cutting my steak, it was rare, not medium rare, and our server was nowhere to be found. My boyfriend ended up stopping another server requesting my steak be returned for extra cooking. Well, when it was brought back out, it was the same exact steak(at this price point I should be given a new one) and it was completely black and charred on the outside yet hardly cooked any better on the inside. Frankly, it was the worst steak I've ever had and was absolutely disgusting. The 'chef' did bring out new accompaniments- mashed potatoes, which were ok, and green beans, which were flavorless and near raw. Not once did the server stop by and ask if everything was better nor did he ask how anyone else was doing. The server disappeared again for quite sometime and eventually cleared our plates after making multiple passes by us to visit other tables. Dessert- a flourless espresso cake with blackberry sauce- was the best item of the night, though hardly made up for the terrible entree. The fastest service from our server was when he whisked by to pick up the check presenter with credit card (again not a word said as he did so) and return it after it was processed. They did give the birthday boy a nice dessert- cheesecake plus the flourless espresso cake- but, again, does not make up for the service and terrible filet. I'd implore management to retrain this particular server as other tables around us seemed to be receiving smiling service that was at least semi attentive. Since this is the second time I have had a negative experience on some level here, I can say I will not return to this location in the future."
"4.0","A very popular weekend brunch place, with good reason.  The specialty pancakes are incredible, even if mine had so much brown sugar in it that I could literally feel the grains against my teeth.  That isn't a knock or praise, that's just how it is.  If that sounds good to you, you will love Pamela's...if that grosses you out, there's a GNC across the street, go make a protein shake.  They turn tables fast for a place this busy, and you get a lot of food for your hard earned cash (they only take cash, so hit up the PNC bank on the corner while you wait 20 minutes for a table).The service is pretty quick since the wait staff doesn't seem to strictly ascribe to seating sections or table divisions the way the British and French carved up the Middle East (and look at all the problems THAT caused).  They also bring you your check with the food and get you off the table fast by making you pay up front.  I have no problems with any of this, Pennsylvanians are known in my home state for their efficiency and lack of skills operating watercraft.  Every decent U.S. City has a place like Pamela's, even some not-so-decent ones (that's right, I'm talking to you, Montgomery, and you, Little Rock).  Pittsburgh's specialty is the crepe like 'hotcakes'.  They are delicious, with lots of brown sugar (see above), and a faintly salty flavor along with a crispiness on the edges.  I tore that shit apart."
"4.0","This is by far my favorite place to eat in the Steel building.  The service is always fast and the people working here are very friendly and seem to have a lot of fun while working together.The breakfast sandwiches are all very good and made fresh.  For lunch, my favorite is either the Buffalo shrimp wrap or the steak and blue sandwich (I sub ranch for the blue cheese).  Every sandwich I have tried has always been great.  The fresh cut fries are a perfect compliment to the large sandwiches.  They have a station where you can add vinegar and Cajun seasoning which I would recommend.  They also have great ranch dressing that goes well with the fries.It is a little pricy, however the portions are huge.  You could split a sandwich and fries with another person and be full.  If you eat a full sandwich and fries by yourself, you will be sleeping the rest of your work day."
"3.0","I came here with a few friends for brunch on a Saturday that everyone in Shadyside was celebrating St. Patrick's day. Because I had one too many frozen cosmo's the night before, I wasn't in the mood for green beer, but they had plenty other options.The hostess had that rude 'couldn't-be-bothered' sort of attitude to her, but I wasn't about to let a 21 year old make ME (a paying customer) feel like a jerk for not having a reservation to a neighborhood pub that serves green beer on a Saturday morning. She seated me promptly after an eye roll or two. The waiter was more than accommodating with lots of water and coffee for the table and was pretty hilarious for most of the meal. My friends got the grilled cheese with pierogies and I opted for the chorizo scramble. My dish needed lots of extra seasoning to make it not taste like a bland heap of nothing. I finally got it right after hitting it with salt, pepper, AND hot sauce. It still wasn't good and I only ate about 1/3 of it. My friend's all reported that the grilled cheese was extra greasy and really not all that great, but the fries with the old bay hit the spot. My only regret is not visiting here during happy hour because their draft list and bar area looked pretty amazing. There were lots of beers I hadn't heard of and the prices didn't seem that unreasonable. The place definitely prides itself on it's beer selection, as the first 4 pages of the menu featured various different sorts of beer. Oh, and the music was bad. Like laughably, noticeably bad."
"2.0","Got the Joey Porter -bella? here a few weeks ago. It was alright, nothing special. It barely had any filling on it which annoyed me. Probably won't come back, there's plenty of other good sandwich shops around."
"4.0","Thai gourmet was the first place I ate the day I moved to Pittsburgh. Delightful, awesome currys. I have a thai problem, wherein I eat thai at least once a week. This place assists with my addiction. I am a thai addict and I am not ashamed to admit it. Thai gourmet is within walking distance to my house and this place is seriously a frequent stop in my week. I think this place is like a step above thai cuisine, certainly there is something aesthetically more appealing about the interior that is a step above TC. This place is a bit further for me to walk, but I am willing, because the food and ambience are great.I'm a bit panang fan here. I pretty exclusively eat currys at thai places. and TG is awesome. they also carry crab rangoon which I'm a sucker for also."
"4.0","My boyfriend and I had dinner here for the first time last night, and we loved it!!We started off with the buffalo cauliflower. The sauce definitely wasn't traditional buffalo sauce, but it still tasted great. We thought the amount of food was a little small for $6, but we enjoyed it nonetheless.For our entrees, I got the cashew cheese flatbread with kalamata olives. Absolutely AMAZING. My boyfriend got the seitan schwarma with a side of fried oyster mushrooms. The seitan in the schwarma was a bit tough, but it still tasted great. The mushrooms were great!! Similar to calamari.We ended things with dessert. I had the peanut butter chocolate chip cookie, and he had the carrot cake. We both got hot chocolates. The hot chocolates only came in one size, and were pretty small, but they tasted great. Service was good- our waitress was great, but she seemed a bit overwhelmed, which led us to believe that they were short staffed. The restaurant's decor is really cute, which is always a plus.Overall, we had a great experience and can't wait to be back!"
"3.0","Cappy's! We went here for karaoke night and stayed til close. We didn't try any food, but ordered plenty of drinks. We sat at a table and the waitress was super attentive and checked back often to see if we needed another drink. It was a full house, but not too full where you can't move. The Karaoke was good and you could tell there were some regulars hitting the stage. There were a few times they didn't have songs someone in our group requested, which we thought was a little weird because they were top 40."
"3.0","We came here and used the groupon deal. It was pretty busy, but the waitstaff seemed to handle it pretty well. The food is delicious. I ordered the garlic naan and kadhai paneer, my SO ordered the goat vindaloo. We enjoyed the meal very much. However, the portions are so small. I could have eaten at least two portions of my meal. I left still hungry. The cost is a bit pricey considering how small the portions are."
"3.0","I'm always in the look out for Japanese food when i travel. This place is located in a shopping center and kinda had a hard time looking for it. The place was pretty quite, there was myself at a table and another at the sushi. I ordered the super combo which consisted of some sushi, teriyaki, tempura rolls all for $27 bucks. The food was ok and thought that they could of gave more for that same price.  The service was ok since i was the only one there so i can't complain."
"4.0","I've been to the 1st and 3rd floors of Sienna Mercato many times, but last night was the first time I got the chance to try out Mezzo!  My girlfriends and I went there for my birthday dinner and I was immediately impressed with the decor on the 2nd level.  The first floor, Emporio, is a bit darker and louder, but Mezzo was bright, open, and furnished in a way that made me feel like I was dining in someone's home. It was very welcoming and a step up from Emporio in all senses.Our waiter thoroughly explained the menu and their specials of the day, and we placed our drink orders and requested the small PA Farmer's cheese board, along with the small bread basket (note: not complimentary. This is actually on their appetizer menu... I think it was $3 for the small).  The only bread I tried out of the basket was the rosemary garlic foccacia and it was SO good, especially with the whipped honey butter that the basket is served with.  For dinner, 2 of the girls elected to split the Wood Roasted Vegetable pizza, the other ordered a half portion of the mushroom risotto, and I ordered a half portion of the sausage gemelli.  When our dishes arrived, I was very glad that I ordered a half portion:  it was still a fairly generous portion, but just enough that I didn't have leftovers to worry about carrying around.  I tried a bite of the pizza and risotto and both were very good... the pizza had a very thin crust, but it was substantial enough to withstand the weight of the sauce and toppings.  The mushroom risotto was phenomenal and will definitely be in my sights when I go back... and my sausage gemelli was outstanding!  My only complaint is that the gemelli was cooked a bit TOO al dente... as in almost not cooked thoroughly.  They had more of a bite to them than I prefer.  The cream sauce and fresh, crumbled sausage were excellent and I'm almost wishing I would've ordered the full portion so I could've had leftovers for lunch today!Overall, Mezzo is a nice, open and airy spot for dinner and/or drinks and I would highly recommend it if you're downtown.   The prices are fairly reasonable, and they have a wide variety of wines and beers to choose from.  Another thing to note is that even though Mezzo is part of the Il Tetto and Emporio building/concept, they are each their own standalone restaurant with entirely different menus. No meatballs at Mezzo!  The nice thing is that this restaurant concept provides a variety of options for a night out.  From dinner to rooftop drinks, Sienna Mercato has you covered!"
"5.0","The hidden gem in shadyside. I like grilled meats and veggies. That's what they specialize in. I highly recommend getting the mixed appetizer to start. Try as much of them as you can. You can't go wrong! Place is da bomb.com. It's also BYOB so you can get bombed for cheap too!"
"5.0","Chicken is always cooked properly. Lunch prices are unbelievably reasonable. I highly recommend this place for a fast lunch."
"4.0","Only one star taken away because I wasn't truly a fan of most of the menu items. Nothing really stood out or got me excited to try. Though with the funny menu item names, the cool decor and friendly staff, and affordable prices, this place is worth a try. I'm not into tots but my table ordered tot nachos and they were pretty good. I had the croquette ball meal and it had really nice lemongrass flavor and a nice texture that went well with the rest of the bowl.Everyone else with me enjoyed their meals too. It is BYOB, but charge a small fee"
"1.0","Very very disappointing. I thought that this would be good because it was located in market square. My strawberry daiquiri was very syrupy and my tacos were dry. Pretty place but would not come back. I would have much rather went across the street for Primanti Brothers"
"4.0","Food was fantastic. Our server not so much... Had to flag her down for drinks and she never came back to check on our table after we got our food. Nice place though, will be back."
"4.0","Food was yummy, but a bit overpriced, especially the drinks. $6.50 for a grilled cheese from the kids menu with only chips, ouch! People were great and it's always cool getting out out in the Burgh."
"5.0","Consistently excellent catering! They are courteous, deliver including needed plates/utensils, and the food is delicious! Wonderful presentation as well."
"5.0","This was the best arepa I have ever had! It was fresh and delicious. The staff were friendly and the place was nice and clean. I wish I lived close to Pittsburgh. I would eat here regularly!"
"1.0","I was kept waiting for almost 50 minutes after the order, very bad customer service. I would surely not recommend this restaurant to any people. Also, I have noticed some signs of discrimination for Indian customers."
"4.0","Stopped here for dinner. Good spot for any group of people. Large space and a large draft menu. I ordered a nice fruit beer that I actually enjoyed two of. I got the tacos, which were tasty. I also tried one of my colleagues nachos was good, they were a wanton type nacho. The service was quite slow, which was the drawback. Okay place to go, but probably not the best recommendation."
"5.0","So, I'm on my way out to California and one of the stopovers happens to be in  Pitsburgh. After fruitlessly searching for anywhere nearby that's open and fairly priced, I almost gave up hope, but then I found this gem of a restaurant. The seafood hoagie is an absolute must try- it was amazing. The reason I'm on my way to California, in a very funny coincidence is to meet my newborn nephew who's name is Gennaro!"
"1.0","Can you spare a chair?  Apparently not!  Our party of 6 were denied chairs.  When my husband and I arrived, our friends were already seated...on stools.  Our table was one of the few tables that had stools.  I don't mind stools, but not for what I thought might be a two hour dinner.  So, I asked the manager if we could have chairs from the other tables that weren't being occupied.  He told us that those tables were for reservations.    My friend mentioned that we too had reservations.  The manager excused himself as if to ask permission from someone else.  When he returned my husband had arrived from parking the car.  We filled him in on what was going on.  When the manager returned my husband also asked for chairs and again we were told that the empty chairs could not be put at our table.  We even asked if we could sit at the tables with the chairs and again were denied.  The tables with the chairs were for 4 and 2 tops, and we had six people.  They refused to put the tables together for us.  We could not believe the lack of willingness and incompetence to resolve this simple matter.  We decided to leave.  As we were leaving, we told the manager that we probably would have had over a $300.00 tab.  We asked him if 6 chairs were worth it.  Apparently they were.  I'm guessing that the people at Zagat had chairs.  However, if you still wish to try Station, call ahead and request a table with chairs.  They will NOT spare a chair."
"1.0","I found three, thick, long hairs on my food. Super disappointing. Aside from that, I used to get this all the time years ago and it unfortunately no longer stands up. Super gross and disappointing. But like THREE HAIRS!!"
"2.0","Decent but terribly inconsistent food. I've had some great dishes and some terrible ones, I love chaat and 3 out of 4 times it was great, but once it was just a fried greasy mess (in a bad way, not in the good way it usually is.) Once the matar paneer was great, once it was oversalted and the peas were just plain bad. I don't know how they do it, but it's a coinflip between good food and an oversalted overcooked bowl.Either way, portions are generous."
"5.0","Came here for dinner on a Saturday night with my husband while visiting family and was very impressed. My husband and I tried both crab salads- one was crab cake and the other was crab chunks, both of which were delicious! Service was great even though they were packed. Key lime pie was the best I've ever had. Will definitely be returning, but will be sure to make a reservation next time. Popular place."
"4.0","If you walk in here during the lunch hour on a typical work week, you have to be prepared and know what you're getting into, that's all. Yes, it's a bit chaotic, it's busy and it's loud. But the amount of salad you actually get is pretty stellar for the price. I've been here a few times now and the staff has always been pleasant - especially the choppers! I appreciate the array of options and that you can control the ingredients in your salad. Am I an everyday-er? No. But some days this certainly hits the spot."
"5.0","The quality of the ingredients is enough to earn five stars. Your taste buds will orgasm with each course. The service is delightful. The Hanger Steak is one of the finest meals I've had in years, and we eat out often. This dish is the quintessential foodie meal...expertly prepared, perfectly balanced. Makes you want to literally lick the plate.We will certainly be back, and with friends!"
"5.0","WOW. Just finished our first meal at Caffe Mona and it was AMAZING. Hands down one of the best breakfasts in Pittsburgh. Had no idea this gem existed. The service was warm, friendly and personalized. It felt like we were dining in Europe. We had the Mediterranean omelet, Chicken Caesar and South gourmet crepes. We will definitely be regulars from now on. And the French toast with Berries was beyond words! Loved it!"
"2.0","Get me some Peanutzz!! We decided on a whim to try something different for a bar and this place indeed was. Saturdays there is a cover for the DJ which was $3. This didn't seem so bad to me after coming from other cities where the covers are $15 and $20 and higher but I feel like the place could use the money. Peanutz is a small venue. The bar area is narrow and cramped then to the left of it there is a dark area where the DJ is along with some tables and then the stairs to the bathroom. If you weren't at the bar then people were just sitting at the tables starring at the DJ or at you... Maybe one or two people were dancing to the music. I thought the music was awesome though - a mix of old school and underground hip hop. Beers were so cheap - I think we paid $5 for three draft beers. Woot!! However some folks were smoking and the bathrooms were gross. My jacket took a few days to air out the smell of the smoke. I won't be returning even if Peanutz offered some peanuts."
"5.0","Leah is a wonderful server, she gave the best recommendations, and we thoroughly enjoyed the evening. 10/10, would recommend, as long as Leah is serving us!"
"1.0","Worst service I've ever seen. Place was pretty much empty just before lunch. Took 30 minutes to get drinks and about the same to get food. Food wasn't anything better than perkins. Asked several times for mayo and ranch but had to go up to the bar where they never even approached me so went to the front desk server to ask. She brought back mayo and forgot the ranch. By this time I didn't want to ask again."
"2.0","Not a fan. Who just offers smoked turkey and not regular turkey? I then went for the roast beef American and they were out of cheese at 11:30 in the morning. They didn't ask if I wanted my bread toasted, but it came that way."
"1.0","Sorry that I will never visit here.  It is not accessible for people of limited mobility.  I cannot believe that in this day, one would open a business that is not accessible.  Sad for the owners and for the city to permit such an atrocity."
"4.0","So I'll lead with the negative - it's pretty expensive for a vegan place in my opinion. Secondly, they don't change up their breakfast/brunch menu enough for those of us who come frequently. However....their brunch, which I've experienced now several times is great. We love the mezze platter, and have tried all of the options by now. The spicy tomato dish, the green sauce, the cauliflower, the incredible smoky baba ganoush...all great, and their homemade pita is the perfect companion. My gluten free not-by-choice partner loves their GF bread. They do a mean shitake mushroom/spinach stir fry, and the potato and sweet potato pancakes is crispy and delicious. I have sampled a latte or two, and enjoyed them. As a reformed former vegan, I did miss the milk in the latte, but overall the flavors were good. A great spot for veggie/vegan folks and those dabbling. I'll be back!"
"1.0","Hard pass on this place in the future. Stopped in here hoping to find some delicious corned beef, just after picking up my daughter a slice of pizza from up the street. Even mentioned that, as I was placing my order. It was only after we payed for my food & our drinks, a guy comes over & says they don't allow other peoples food in their establishment. I honestly thought the guy was joking! He wasn't. I told him that would've been nice to know before purchasing my entree. He said, you should've asked!.. Zero offers of making a to-go order, nada. I had to ask for that! By the time I got my order ready to go it was cold. I definitely feel this was shady business & bad corned beef!! Definitely look elsewhere for a better taste of both."
"3.0","I went here in February 2019 visiting in PittNothing remarkable, decent food, fast service. I guess I am not a hipster lol Very clean and fast friendly service. Good to keep as a stand by"
"1.0","Sad I feel the need to write this, as I used to love this place (the food and beer selection is great). However, last time there had the worst service I think I've ever experienced...anywhere.First, waited for 25 minutes at the bar before I even got a water. There was also a mess - an old half eaten Mac and cheese, some drinks and someone's check sat there with me the whole time. Then put my name in for a table, and waited another 20 min while I watched four tables sit empty and the hosts chatted with their friends. When I finally asked if I could sit at one of the open tables, they said they had tried texting me it was ready but they had bad service (I was sitting 5 feet from the host stand).After finally getting to a table and waiting another few minutes without anyone approaching me to take an order, and having so far spent 45 minutes to get a water, I finally left to get some food across the street. So, unfortunately I won't be coming back, because as much as I did like the food here, it only tastes good if you ever actually get it."
"5.0","Went here for lunch. Sat at bar with great service. The Guac was fresh and tasty. We got the lunch platter and once it came out we ate it all. The burrito, enchilada and taco combo was great. Fresh flavor and all so filling. Another person in the party got fajitas de carnitas and they were great the pork was spiced right and comes with onions,peppers and also rice and beans. Will be back often."
"4.0","Keep it short.....full of heat!  wooo!   I forget what we got exactly, but it was delicious.  Def sweated it out at the table 3/4 of the way into the meal.   *And to clarify, I really enjoyed the heat!  More is more for me!!!There was a deal for students that we forgot to get.  I will def be visiting here the next time I am looking for Indian food in Pittsburgh."
"5.0","The absolute best pancakes and potatoes I have ever had in my entire life. AMAZING!!!"
"4.0","Stopped in for lunch while in the Strip District with my family. Had the #7 which was enormous. Ate half for lunch and half for dinner. Sandwich was delicious but I don't want to think about the calories. Service was good. Not a fancy place. Great stop if you're hungry and looking for a big sandwich for short money."
"3.0","I'v stopped here 2 different times. The first time I got wings and a side of mac n cheese  to eat there and it was really great.Every thing was hot, the mac n cheese was creamy and cheesy and  the wings were crispy and fresh, yum.  The next time I stopped in I wanted a large order to take home for my family. It took them an hour and a half to make me the chicken. There was over a dozen people come in and pick up their food as I sat and waited. Since you pay when you order I just had to wait. I asked to talk to a manager but the guy told me he wasn't there. The people in the back laughed so I think he was the manager. So I finally got my food and have never been back. No food is worth being disrespected like that."
"5.0","Just go here.  The Zelionople classic has expanded to Butler St.  If you're bored with the usual suspects, meander on over to Burgh'ers' newest location in Lawrenceville.  Incredible service and they are opening a full bar in the near future.  Oh yeah, and the fries? Yep."
"5.0","As far as I am concerned, this is the best Thai food in Pittsburgh.  Inexpensive and good friendly service.  The family that owns this restaurant are really some of the nicest people you will ever meet.  More often than not, they will add a free desert or small treat to my take out order.  I love spice food, and when I ask for a level 8 of spiciness, I get level 8.  At most other Thai restaurants, I get a 4 no matter what I ask for.  If you like spicy food too, then I'm sure you will appreciate that.  If you dine there, I admit that the atmosphere is nothing to write home about.  I'd describe it as a hole in the wall, but in a good way.  Not fancy or pretentious by any means. Then again, at this price point, you really shouldn't expect too much."
"5.0","I'm a big fan of Delanies! Great space to study and work -- and it is usually nice and quiet. They are a great community space, and feature art work and performers regularly. I don't drink coffee - but the tea and snacks are great. The staff are always welcoming, which is a great added benefit!"
"5.0","The food was excellent. I had the tofu scramble. I definitely will be back when I come back to PA. It was a great experience."
"4.0","We enjoy ordering for take out from Rialto occasionally, it's location is really convenient to our home. They have a decent amount of seating if you wanted to stay and eat there. Our go to menu item is the XL pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms, they don't skimp on the toppings! They do however charge per topping which can add up. The staff is friendly and helpful. There is a sign out front that says 'best soft serve ice cream', I'd skip the soft serve here and stick with the pizza. Overall, if you're looking for good pizza, Rialto won't disappoint. Plus unlike some of the other pizza places around the area they take credit cards which is nice!"
"5.0","The food is so good!! Service is a little slow but the food and drinks are absolutely worth the wait."
"3.0","Super small taco joint in Southside with $3 tacos and limited bar seating. I got the carnitas taco and pollo taco, both on a corn tortilla. Decent place for a quick and filling lunch, so I might come back to try some of the other tacos on their menu."
"4.0","I'm from California and hotcakes is something that's not common in our food vocabulary. We just settle on pancakes and call it a day.My brother took me and my mother to Pamela's for brunch and it was pretty packed. Fortunately, it was only a 10 minute wait and a huge crowd came in after us. I glanced through the menu and learned that they're known for their specialty hotcakes. They all looked very good, but settled on the the strawberry hotcakes (was craving strawberries). We finally got seated, ordered what we want, and chilled in the lively atmosphere of the diner. The food came out relatively fast and I was ecstatic for my hotcakes. They use FRESH strawberries instead of the syrupy strawberries in a can! The hotcakes were thin like a crepe and the crispy edges were the best part. A bit heavy on the butter, but that's how you get the crispiness. The sour cream surprisingly worked well with the strawberries, as it balanced out the sweetness from its tart element. As for the brown sugar, that was like the cherry on top. It was pure harmony.Definitely check it out when you're in Pittsburgh!"
"2.0","I always knew the Buca chain to be fun for groups,  but our recent experience at this location was sub par. Portions are hearty, but the pasta is very minimally sauced and price is high. Service was very friendly....but terribly slow. I rarely order veal, so I was especially sad to have it served tough.Skip Buca, it's not enough fun to compensate for mediocre food in a city filled with fantastic,  authentic Italian food for less money."
"5.0","My husband and I chose to visit Capital Grille while in town for work. We made a reservation, not knowing how busy they could/would be. We ordered the bone-in ribeye, med-rare, a side of sauteed wild mushrooms and the augratin potatoes. The steak came out perfect! It was exactly how we ordered and tasted fabulous. It was not over-seasoned, and was extremely tender. The mushrooms and potatoes were large portions and also quite delicious. The restaurant/restrooms are clean and the service was on point."
"5.0","The prosciutto sandwich is so simple and delish and the bread is amazing. Chai Latte was also perfect! Brought home the raspberry tart for dessert and it was so very fancy and amazingly flavorful!!! The service was super helpful and kind! Can't wait to come back!"
"5.0","My family lives in Pittsburgh so I visit often and it is a must to go to Alexanders. The food is very authentic Italian. The atmosphere is cozy and very relaxing. This is a family run business that has been in the Bloomfield Community Forever. The food was delicious, cocktails were made like they should be very tasty with no lack of alcohol, and the service was excellent."
"5.0","Kinda a hole-in-the-wall place, but a hole filled with delicious food and aromatic spices!My son and I were here for a tour of Pitt, and needed some dinner. We were greeted by the owner, maitre-d, waiter, and chef, Mr. Ahmed. He's a very friendly guy. We watched him bring some cardomom to the couple across from us, and give them instructions on how to make their own tea at home.My son had a sheek kabob, I had lamb paneer. Yum! My son was new to Indian food and started the meal with a little reluctance, but ended the meal stuffed and very happy. I got to try some of his kabab, which was very well prepared. Both entrees were fresh and flavorful and you could tell not over processed into nothingness. My spinach dish was fresh as it still had that bright green color which had not faded into an olive drab. It was great.Total damage for 2 entrees, rice, 2 orders of naan, a mango lassi, and diet soda? $30, and well worth it."
"1.0","We used to order about six pizzas a month from this place, but are now done with Gennaro's. Last night, we ordered two LARGE (16'/12-cut) one-topping pizzas, but when the pizzas arrived, they were MEDIUM/14' size, with one cut into 10 slices and the other in eight. We checked the receipt to confirmed we were charged for LARGE pizzas and then called to let them know that they sent two mediums. The unapologetic response we got was that they've recently changed sizes and MEDIUM is the new LARGE. (You'd think they might have mentioned that to a regular customer?) So we ended up with the equivalent of 16 slices when we ordered 24. Either somebody screwed up and they lied instead of fixing the problem OR they really are now charging large prices for medium pizzas. So I called the following day and asked to speak to the owner. The man who answered the phone said the owner wasn't available, but identified himself as the manager and confirmed the story. I pointed out to him that the menu on their website still shows that a large pizza is 16'/12-cut and he told me the website hadn't been updated yet.There are lots of places to order pizza from on the South Side and I'm sure I can find another that's more worthy of my business than Gennaro's."
"5.0","Tried this awesome new place for the first time last night. Shared a few dishes with friends along with a couple beers. Everything was AMAZING! Probably my favorite dish was the chorizo tapioca. So good! Service was excellent as well. Looking forward to going back very soon!"
"5.0","Having had lunch here 3x in about 3 months I would say that this is one of my favorite lunch spots on the infrequent occasion of going out to eat at work. All 3 times having ordered the same dish (Da Shoyu Mein, if you're curious), I have nothing but good things to say and experience here. I've dined-in once and phoned-in orders the other two times. I like that the cuisine is a little different than other area Asian fare restaurants and it has been consistent every time....delicious, really. It's tucked on Wood Street, while it doesn't get the same foot traffic as Market Square over lunchtime, it is worth the extra block and a half walk. Each time I've gone it's been busier than the last, I hope they continue to do well.I have heard there is a second floor with a lunch buffet but I do not have details on that yet--will report back."
"5.0","I can't figure out why this place isn't packed! The menu is creative, food delicious and wine list is solid - great wines for good prices. My husband and I and another couple recently attended the Jamison lamb dinner - every course and wine pairing blew us away!  Cara is a great host and the service is knowledgeable and attentive."
"5.0","Hands down our favorite spot we've tried in Pittsburgh. The staff is super friendly, the drinks are delicious, and the atmosphere is awesome. We took advantage of the happy hour specials and enjoyed the Moscow mule, cucumber press, bohemian forest, and mont brouilly cocktails. The Mont Brouilly was my favorite. We also tried the cheese plate which was delicious. Highly recommend!"
"5.0","I initially came for the beer, which was really good, but the cuisine was exquisite. Staff was very attentive and the decor was well done"
"1.0","Excellent food. Lame cash only policy where the ATM dings you for $2.50 so if you're going bring cash otherwise get dinged for a surcharge."
"4.0","After having my high hopes of attending the grand buffet crushed by a long line of other hungry hopefuls all rushing the gates prior to closing, I decided to wander down to the wheelhouse...The wheelhouse offers a nice happy hour until 7pm with some good apps at half price definitely made for sharing! The menu items include a few items customized to Pittsburgh including Pittsburgh nachos which looked quite interesting.I decided on a burger and was pleasantly surprised by the taste.The only down side would be regular food items (like burgers or chicken) are a little pricy."
"2.0","Good hot dogs just kinda expensive at $3.50+ a piece. The beer selection is great although to make your own 6 pack or buy singles you will be spending a minimum of $3 a beer depending on the type. That's $18 at minimum for a 6 pack. Talk about highway robbery. One should never spend over $7 for a 6 pack unless it's imports or craft beer. It would be a great place if it was cheaper!!"
"5.0","Wow!  Great meal with attentive service.  I had the romain salad -- delicious with home made croutons.  A few too many for me but sooo tasty. For my entree I had the scallops with quinoa and grilled carrots.  Fantastic!  Scallops cooked to perfection.  Couldn't resist dessert so tried the caramel salted pana cotta.  Heaven in a dish!!!  I will definitely return when back in Pittsburgh.  Well worth the visit."
"4.0","This is a fantastic little Italian restaurant on a side street in Pittsburgh.  I started with a bowl of the sausage and chick pea soup. I had never tried this type of soup but I wanted to be adventurous. Boy, was I glad that I did. It consisted pieces of spicy sausage mixed in a tomato based broth with chick peas and spinach (I think). We added some shredded parmigiana cheese on top and wow....My main course was homemade orecchiette with sausage and broccoli rabe. It was very tasty but not overpowering. You will need to review the menu before you go as they do have a limited selection and the menu rotates seasonally.  The place is small and was packed so the service suffered a bit. The owner was walking around greeting patrons. He seems like a nice guy.  I guess I will finish my review by quoting Arnold Schwarzenegger and saying 'I'll be back'.  I will."
"4.0","Tim the manager is great. Always chatting you up as he makes your meal and making it fun."
"3.0","This place has a cute look and a great local feel with tasty, if Americanized, food. We stopped by late in the evening on our way to the bar for a quick bite to eat. The trendy concrete bar and the colorful decor gave the small venue a more open and bright atmosphere. The restaurant was super full, which is hard to navigate with the tiny space being essentially a wraparound bar for seating. After a while, though, it cleared out enough for our party to take a seat. I ordered one chicken and one carnitas taco, and split an order of nachos without meat. It was pretty awesome to see my food be prepared right in front of me as I ordered, and that transparent open concept really works for them. The cooking space was especially tiny and it was interesting to see it all come together with so little to work with. However, from the perspective of an LA native from a full Mexican family, the flavors weren't super spot on. The carnitas especially tasted like a sweet pulled pork I might expect at a barbecue, instead of fatty and savory carnitas. Certain toppings like cheese and a 'pico' that was literally just tomatoes made it feel very inauthentic. Still, my food came out quickly and was pretty yummy. I appreciated the tortillas being warmed on the griddle and acquiring a bit of a toast, a touch that's only achieved by using a comál like that. The nachos were very standard but tasty nonetheless. I saw both the cook and the cashier make friendly conversation with familiar regulars. It really contributed to the cozy, personal vibe of the whole place, without slowing down their service. For a quick fix, we were pretty happy with what we had. But for authentic Mexican flavors, they've got to get out of their comfort zone a little more."
"3.0","The tacos are good, but their meats can be dry. Hit or miss. They have smaller, conventional menu (chicken, steak, pork, veggie?) items for their tacos. While the service was fast and error-free, they are not the friendliest people."
"1.0","Ten ounce filet was only about 8 ounces. Medium well steak was well done not medium well.  Bernese sauce had no flavor. Longhorn steak is better than a $200 dinner for 2. The mushrooms were very over cooked.  The cream bulee was weak with no temperature gradient and poor custard flavor.  We were quite disappointedThe service was excellent. Food disappointing and expensive"
"5.0","I've been here twice and have loved everything. The croissant is huge and flaky. I got some pastry with apricot that was amazing (don't remember what it's called). And the macarons....amazing. I ate 6 in one setting. The raspberry are my favorite. They open at 7:30am which is perfect for when I get to work early and want to get something for breakfast. They are quick, knowledgeable, and give great service. Plus, it's super cute inside!"
"5.0","Station is a GREAT addition to Pittsburgh. My boyfriend and I went for an early dinner on Saturday and grabbed seats at the bar. The bartender (who we later found out was one of the owners, Justin) immediately started chatting with us and giving recommendations on their menu as well as for Pittsburgh in general. We're fairly new to Pittsburgh so we always love getting local insights! We like to share multiple dishes so based on Justin's recommendations we went with the carrot salad which he said was probably the best item on the menu, the wings, and the crispy chicken leg/breast dish. We also had to try the chicken liver mousse after reading all of the Yelp reviews. Best dish on the menu was an understatement, the boyfriend said it's possibly the best dish he's had in Pittsburgh. The combination of the carrots and the cheese and the sauce and the chickpea fritters, oh my! We already plan to get more than one order of this next time. The wings had an interesting Parmesan foam which set them apart from other garlic wings, and the sides with the chicken entree really complemented the dish. The chicken liver mousse had a very distinct taste that I enjoyed, though I can see why it may not be for everyone. We were hoping for port as an after dinner drink but they didn't have any, and we weren't familiar with the other selections so Justin gave us a couple tastings of amaro and campari followed by a complimentary shot just so he could join in too. They weren't for us so we ended up ordering station sours from the cocktail menu to finish to our night, BUT THEN Justin brought out an order of the popcorn panna cotta on the house. If the carrot salad isn't my boyfriend's favorite dish in Pittsburgh, this dessert is. The crunchy caramel popcorn with the creamy panna cotta was the perfect combination. We don't usually even order desserts, but I think we're now stuck with getting this any time we go back. Overall this has been our best restaurant experience since moving to Pittsburgh and we've tried quite a few places. The couple standout dishes plus the awesome service made this a place we will definitely return. Can't wait to try their brunch!"
"5.0","Delicious home cooking that tastes like your Italian Nonna's. I recently discovered Merante's while walking through Bloomfield during lunchtime. At first I thought the store was just gifts, but the delicious smells drew me inside. The back of the store is a full-blown kitchen stocked with any number of delicious delicacies. My personal favorites include: sausage stuffed peppers, ribs and liver and onions (yeah yeah I know...). The prices are reasonable and the portions are HUGE. I should also mention that the staff incredibly kind. Merante's food is made obviously made with love."
"4.0","Girasole is a delicious dinner choice for Italian food. I've gotten the Spinach and Ricotta Ravioli both times I've been here and I've always been satisfied with my choice!! The rich tomato cream sauce is so tasty that I wish the portion size was slightly larger so that I could make the meal last longer. The pasta entrees come with either a soup or salad on the side--and I highly recommend the fresh house salad! My only qualms with the dining experience are with the size of the restaurant. It is quite cozy so probably not the best option for large parties as seating is limited. Also, while I've never had problems with my dinner reservations, I know of several people who had to wait outside for long periods of time despite having a reservation."
"1.0","Delete my detailed review about this restaurant because it is a new business in town, though the owner texted me that 'I'm stupid.' My previous review meant no harm but indicated that customers are NOT STUPID and THEY CAN FIND OUT if this place may have the behaviors of cheating customers. Honesty is the key of a successful business. I may change my review score in the future if your food is served as I order, but in the meanwhile, please stop messaging me and showing a bitter & mean restaurant owner as Pittsburgh doesn't welcome."
"4.0","THEIR 5 CHEESE PIZZA IS SO GOOD.The only thing thats good, but it's SO GOOD. Favourite place in the city, but seriously, the 5 cheese pizza. It's the only pizza I get anymore. The ricotta on it is to die for, and I usually add spinach and tomato. But it really is the only thing that's worth getting there."
"2.0","Antoon's pizza is okay, but it's really nothing special. At Pitt, there's a rivalry going between Antoon's and Sorrento's-- you're either on one team or the other, and it's the subject of many a heated debate in the dorms. Sorrento's pizza is much more flavorful and less than a block away from Antoon's, but I would recommend checking out both and deciding for yourself lol"
"5.0","We tried this place on a whim because there was a great groupon available and I'm so glad we discovered it. We had $50 worth of food to get with the groupon deal so we had a ton of food and could sample different menu items to compare to our usual spot (India Garden in Monroeville) I have to say this place came out slightly ahead. The mango Lassis here were definitely better- fantastic flavor and consistency. We also tried different kinds of naan and both were delicious. So we're the chicken samosas! Super flavorful. As for the main dishes- I had chicken korma, my go-to favorite. It was excellent. I had a medium spice level and I'm someone who loves super spicy food. Medium is PLENTY spicy!! So keep that in mind maybe. My boyfriend had butter chicken, mild and it was also excellent!! Both will be re-ordered! The service was great- everyone was so friendly and attentive. We even got little donuts for free as dessert. Whether you're a fan of Indian food or just want to try it- come here! And check groupon!"
"5.0","Very friendly and fast. The atmosphere is very inviting. You can sit inside or outside for brunch. I highly recommend the ham with breakfast."
"3.0","CASH ONLY!CASH ONLY!CASH ONLY!A lot of history with this place.  Be sure to read the back of the menu.I had the New England Clam Chowder.  To my disappointment it tasted like it was from a can.  I also had the crab cake sandwich which was a bit better with more flavor.  Honestly, I'll probably skip this place on future visits to PIT."
"5.0","Great cheap taco stand. The key is the meat, which is excellently seasoned. Try the carnitas 'mexican style' with only onion, cilantro and lime juice. Fast service from the street side stall makes for a quick, delicious lunch. I'd skip the nachos personally and stick to the meat, though. It's all about the meat."
"4.0","Great food, but you'll pay for it!  Not cheap...  Plus some of the servers aren't Japanese, geez."
"4.0","A little pricey for what you get but overall good quality! I love the layout of the restaurant but he wait staff didn't explain much on the menu"
"4.0","Twelve has masterminds behind their businesses. This taco place is so so so delicious!! I can't rave how much I love the tacos here. It's a bit small on the inside, but that gives it more character. Eat everything!"
"2.0","I had their soy garlic drumsticks and wings.  Definitely have had better elsewhere.  I remember trying the wings when they first opened and really loving them, but now they are just meh.  The chicken was too oily and were not cooked evenly.  Half of a couple of my drumsticks didn't even have the soy garlic on it and only tasted like fried batter.  I've definitely experienced better here before, but I don't know what happened this time."
"5.0","My husband chose this place for a date on a Friday night. Based on reviews and researching the menu, we were excited about the place, however not thrilled about the drive to get there. For a Friday, it didn't turn out too bad and we were able to find an on-street parking spot not far from the restaurant. The main street of the town is cute and full of restaurant options if we choose to head this way in the future. Walking into the restaurant, it was smaller than I expected, however had very romantic, earthly feel to it.  We were greeted pleasantly by a waitress and she informed us that we could choose where we wanted to sit. As the place was pretty much full, we were limited on options but were able to find a table for two. Closely spaced with minimal walking space between each one, you could hear the conversation of the guests next to you. The table was set with candles and a rose in the center. As it was BYOB, our waitress was quick to open our bottle of wine and pour a class for each of us, placing the rest of the bottle in an ice bucket for when we wanted to refill later. This menu was so exciting to me! I am not very adventurous when it comes to food, however, there were several options with a slight twist that sounded worth trying. We were started off with complimentary white bean hummus with dipping bread drizzled with balsamic vinegar. It was pretty tasty and a great way to begin dinner. After questioning the waitress on what to order, I ended up with the Pan Seared Duck Breast served over cubed roasted potatoes, and a side of fresh pears and apples. To my surprise the pear and apple combination was served cold but paired well with the rest of the dish. The waitress was kind enough to give us a side of Fettuccine Carbonara (the other dish I was torn between)  to share and man was it delicious! Large, freshly cut ham and bacon covered in a wonderful cream sauce. I was in heaven! My husband ordered the Salmon and Quinoa and thought it was good. The portions were large enough for me to take a small amount home for lunch the next day. This place: wonderful ambiance, delicious food, exceptional service. I have a feeling we will be back in the future!"
"4.0","My first time here was on a Wednesday around noon and I tried the $10 lunch buffet. The place was relatively empty but got more crowded as lunchtime approached, and the waiters was very attentive the entire time. I don't know too much about different Indian dishes but everything I tried was delicious, especially the naan with the spinach and potato dip, and a salad with chickpeas, onions, and green peppers. There were plenty of dishes along with salads, rice, and dessert. Fountain drinks and chai tea (you can choose to have it with or without sugar) were also included in the lunch buffet. Overall this was a great value for the buffet and I really enjoyed it! I would definitely stop by again for a quick lunch."
"1.0","Are. You. Joking???Setting: with the Walmart dishes and top 40 hits playing with the weird old lady apartment deco.. Not a great vibe.Service: had to ask for literally everything! Having been a server for several years (in an Italian restaurant!) I get how things work and if a waiter is 'in the weeds.' However we arrived at 5pm on a Thursday and the place was dead! Had to ask for more water, bread, the check, boxes, - several times because she kept forgetting. She was too busy sitting at the bar talking with the other employees. Food: gross, gross, gross! My angel hair pasta was a bowl of soup! I have never had such crappy sauce! Price: I think this is what has me so pissed. Crappy atmosphere, horrible service - and then you charge me $70 bucks for:-1 soda $3-1 salad $7-1 appetizers $10-2 pasta dishes $50!?!? WTH!? I don't mind paying good money for good service, and food. However, for crappy EVERYTHING I could've gone to Olive Garden and paid half and it still would've been better.Came here on a recommendation from a work colleague... Won't be back - EVER."
"5.0","My kind of brewpub. Playfulness comes through in both their beer and food, and I like a place that doesn't take itself too seriously. The service was excellent and our stay at the bar felt like we were bellying up to our local, even though this was our first time here. My husband and I got the mushroom crostini and didn't catch the fact that it contained cashew cheese until after the fact. Score one for the vegans. We also got the Scotch egg; the sausage was tender and the egg runny. Perfect. Finished off our food sampling with the pierogi, which were also vegan and incredibly satisfying. As for the beers, I really dug the sours and my husband liked the Pilsner (non-dry hopped). The guava Berliner was particularly good. The wet-hopped IPA was too bitter for my taste, but the Objectively Enjoyable was balanced and smooth."
"3.0","Never had an issue with delivery time, though I tend to order on the early side, 6pm. Pizza is good but very salty."
"5.0","Great selection of flavorful dishes with a nice clean interior. Although it was fairly quiet which is not something I'm use to at most ethnic restaurants (could use some music) the waitress was super sweet and attentive and one of the owners actually came out personally to ask us if we enjoyed our meal. Tikka masala was rich and flavorful as was the tandoori chicken. One of the curries was bit oily for my taste but there was plenty of other dishes to choose from. Would definitely try again once I digest the many plates of food I ate in a week or so ..."
"5.0","Overall, we had a great night here once we figured it out.   It's different, for sure, but a nice concept and I'd definitely go back.   For starters, the service was excellent - our server was friendly, knowledgeable, and prompt.   She took the time to explain everything on the menu and overall did a great job.  About that menu though.   I recommend that you scroll through the photos on Yelp because you can't really picture the dishes with the menu descriptions otherwise.  The menu has great variety and is well suited toward a tapas style meal.  You can mix and match a bunch of different things for a fun and satisfying meal.  We sampled a bunch of dishes and shared bites...several of the Robotayaki (yummy little barbeque skewers), both types of gyoza (super crispy dumplings), the salmon handroll (absolutely delicious), Takoyaki (octopus balls - crispy outside and soft inside - yum!), the okonomiyaki (a friend pancake of goodies), and the miso ramen (good, but I liked all the other stuff better).   We finished with both desserts - highly recommend the fried ice cream.   Overall, the food was top notch - even if we weren't entirely sure what we were ordering.   The atmosphere of the place was nice as well, though be prepared for a few things.   First, it's hard to find, as many other yelpers have said.  The door is on the side street around from Round Corner.   You go in and are faced with two more doors - go straight.  Then up BOTH steep flights of stairs and there you have it.  Once you are up there, the space is pretty small.  We were seated in a room off the left - the Japanese style with a hole in the floor.  Ladies - this is a place for pants since getting up and down off the floor in a skirt can be a little less than graceful.       They did not appear to have a ton of seating, so I'd say that a reservation is the way to go."
"4.0","Took some friends here recently who came to visit from out of town and we all loved it! Everyone got something different and we just tried each other's food. I got the lamb it was so good. We also got the cold sampler for an appetizer and I loved that as well. Nothing beat the Turkish coffee at the end of dinner. I'm definitely going back!!"
"2.0","The food is very average - I ate the black bean burger, while my companions had the chicken parmesan and the taco salad.  Good enough, but not a reason to stop in again (for lunch, anyway).Apart from the food, the ambience is pretty casual and dive-y.  Cool local art for sale hanging on the walls. I would imagine coming here at night for a beer, live music, and mediocre food could be quite enjoyable.  I wouldn't go back for the food, but a dive-y night out? Sure."
"4.0","Complimentary parking BUT only if you park in the CORRECT garage! And don't mention that to the out of towner when they call to inquire nor apologize when you decline to validate because they did not park in the CORRECT garage. Deduct one star! Anyway, always consistently good filet mignon. We both got the Seasonal Pairings which was $47.95 for salad, 6 oz filet, side & dessert. Filet prepared perfectly rare. Ruth Chris has been the only place that I have ever been able to get a perfectly prepared rare filet. The blue cheese dressing on the salad is phenomenal. If there is a Ruth Chris available when I am traveling, you can be sure I am eating there."
"3.0","Not sure we need another burger joint, but this one is very good. Tessaro's is my gold standard for hamburgers, but they do okay here.The service was very prompt and the decor is very pleasant.For now this place is BYOB, bit it looks like they will add the craft beer very soon."
"3.0","Nice cafe, but a little pricy for what we ordered. I ordered the French Toast and an orange juice which came out to 14 dollars. Our dishes came out very quickly and the French Toast was plated nicely. The only reason I brought up the price of the dish was because it was definitely lacking in flavor. The strawberry sweetness was overpowering. I ended up having my friends finish my dish for me because it was too sweet. Another friend of mine ordered a dish that came with potatoes and those were also lacking in flavors. On another note, the ordering staff are very kind and helpful. Cafe Raymond is a nice place to take a relative or date on the weekend, but the breakfast was lacking in flavors. Pamela's diner is cheaper and while the food is probably 'lower quality' it is tastier than Raymond's."
"3.0","Food was pretty good - we had the farmhouse burger, kielbasa, and street tacos. That said, it was a bit overpriced for what you get, especially the beer - 2 IPAs for $20 is just a little steep for me. Worth checking out for the men's bathroom experience alone - leave it to the Bus for that one. Good, but I'm not sure I'd visit this restaurant twice."
"3.0","La Feria truly has very, very sweet employees. Everyone we spoke to was really just excellent and that boosted my review a star. But this place has a few things that made me a bit unhappy. Although there are vegetarian menu items, everything is very obviously prepared long before and heated up. The heating up process took an incredibly long time, so one might even think they were getting a made to order meal. Thankfully, everything was warm enough but it really did a number on the taste. The rice is bland. My frittata was bland. Even the lettuce was bland. Dressing didn't help. The other problem I had was the description of the food vs. what you actually receive. My grandmother assumed she was getting a lentil soup and she instead received a plate of mostly rice with some lentils on the side. I ordered a potato and sundried tomato tortilla with egg and there was no tortilla in sight.. it was another plate of mostly rice with a small frittata on the side. Kind of disappointing! The beautiful items in the store and the interesting descriptions on the menu make you assume the food would be very flavorful and authentic but that is the furthest from the truth..."
"5.0","This is my all time favorite restaurant in the Southside. If I am looking for something quick and easy to pick up I order the $5 falafels to go. Every time that I have dined in, the service was great and I have never left unhappy. The only thing that I would change is the wine selection. I wish they had something better than barefoot. Overall, A+"
"5.0","Consistently wonderful!I eat here often and never disappointed.The Linguine Rustic (linguini w/ little neck clams) was the best I've ever eaten!  Their house salad that comes with your entre is absolutely perfect and flavorful (gorgonzola cheese and sunflower seeds are a wonderful touch!).Bellissimo!"
"5.0","I've been consistently impressed with the fresh healthy salads, panini, pizza, and soup. Fresh ingredients, nice flavors, and they also have beer and wine. As an added perk, special bins for recycling and composting. This is one of the best places to get a salad in Oakland."
"4.0","Delivery is fast to Mt Washington. Food is always hot. The price is right for what I order."
"5.0","Our group of 8 recently enjoyed dinner at the CG in Pittsburgh. It was a very busy night as the Steelers were in town and the restaurant was seating two very large groups of Cardinals fans. As we have come to expect from the CG, the food was excellent. But we found the  service to be below our past experiences. When our server delivered an overcooked steak to my wife,  a restaurant manager noticed our frustration and stepped in to relieve us of the need to lodge a complaint with our server. So that the my wife would not sit with nothing to eat while they fired another steak, the manager sent her a wonderful crabmeat cocktail. The manager later returned with a perfectly cooked steak. I learned the managers name is Nick and that not only is he excellent with patrons, he is highly regarded by his fellow employees. Bravo Nick!"
"5.0","Soooooo good. Crispy thin crust and quick delivery for an independent place. Haven't had anything other than pizza but that's because it's sooooo good. Black and gold pizza is a must."
"3.0","I've come here for brunch a few times and the food never disappoints. However, the service is soooo slow. It took a while to get coffee/espresso drinks, to order, then to get food, and finally to pay. I think we were there for over 2 hours, even though we had no wait to be seated and it wasn't crowded. Our waiter was working hard but he had to make all the drinks himself while waiting his tables, and I'm not sure what the other staff hanging around were supposed to be doing. I still love the food, and it was a great place for BYO before because you could leisurely sip on your mimosas while waiting for service. Hopefully they make some changes to speed up service, because it doesn't do the food justice!"
"5.0","Run!  do not walk to this food truck! Had their combo tonight ... sliced beef/kimchi/rice bowl tonight @hitchhiker brewing. It was incredibly flavorful... also had these dumplings that were so delicious!"
"5.0","The only negative I have, is that I didn't know about this place sooner. Arancini was delicious, the jerk chicken skewers were great. Even the rice and beans on the plate were done right. I often feel that chicken is dry and over cooked, more often than not. Not here, the sauce that it came with was a great addition. My friend had the filet tip sandwich. Tender, juicy steak. I even liked the fries, which rarely happens. Finally a restaurant in the southside I will look forward to going to."
"1.0","Really terrible taste.I was so angry that I signed up to write a review.I came from Korea and missed hometown food.It seemed good, but the noodles didn't cook properly and taste terrible.Do you see the noodles stick together?Also, the noodles weren't much different from the noodles made at the factories that sell at Korean food markets. (2 dollars one)I hardly understand why it is so high star.In Korea or Japan, I'm sure that if they provide these foods, you'll be ruined in six months.If you say you've eaten here and have eaten ramen, it's a shame.This is no more than just a piece of flour.The ramen I ate in Boston was just as good as Korea or Japan, but in here, really really really x 1000 disappointed.Moreover, how expensive is it? It is twice the price of Korea or Japan.To get an expensive price in the United States, they need to improve their taste at least ten times better than now."
"5.0","The most stunning dive of dives in the city- neon lights and Yuengling at 10AM sharp. And the sandwiches! They're glorious. I may have erred in going for the brisket over the corned beef, but I couldn't have been happier. Paper-thin, moist, and sweet with onions and creamy dressing. The ideal sandwich, truly."
"5.0","My new fav mexican place in the neighborhood. Free fresh chips and salsa (i think it should be a must in all mexican restaurants) , great margaritas (they HUGE) , and delicious fajitas ( made spicy as per request).The server was super sweet and the vibe of the restaurant was casual and chill. A nice place to hangout with fam and friends !!"
"2.0","Before a concert on Saturday night, my husband, two of our friends, and I all snagged dinner together at Station at 6pm. Finding an available restaurant for Saturday night just a week in advance can be challenging, so I was happy to obtain a reservation here.Hubby and I had previously been to Station for a Yelp event. We had a great time - food was great, drinks were great, conversation was great, staff was great, the Bulleit Bourbon rep was great. Because of this event - and all of the great reviews - Station has been on my to-return-to list.The four of us were running about 10 minutes late but were seated immediately as soon as we arrived. I had spent the Yelp event on a cozy leather bench seat in the bar area and got to check out the dining room this time. The decor is trendy and cool, but the temperature was quite chilly (I almost wore my jacket during the meal) and the wood chairs became a bit uncomfortable throughout our hour and a half stay.I ordered the Duck and White Bean Ravioli. I was expecting a rich, creamy dish, but got the exact opposite. The combination of arugula and a smoky onion broth gave a very bitter flavor to the dish. The ravioli seemed Asian-inspired with a thick pasta, and the duck filling was heavy. I did not enjoy the dish. My husband ordered the Roasted Venison Leg. Based on the description, I expected a large amount of meat with sweet potatoes and gnocchi on the side. Though the dish had nice flavors, the presentation and quantity fell far short of our expectations. A small dinner plate arrived only about one-quarter covered in food. A few ounces of venison sat on the plate with artistic dots (I'm assuming the sweet potato and gnocchi bits?) placed around the petite slices. It looked like a child's size quantity of food that just didn't deliver for the $29 price tag.Based on the above, I would have given the experience three stars, but unfortunately, the waitress pulled the whole experience down to two. Now the pros... she did what was directly requested of her. The cons? Her energy was less than a zero, and she seemed to make no effort beyond specific requests to help us. The initial bottle of water was delivered, and even after our glasses were nearly empty and only a few ounces remained in the bottle, I had to request more to drink. We were interested in ordering more beers and cocktails but were never asked about it, even when the glasses were clearly empty. When we were asked how we were doing (the only time), she received one response and quickly scurried off again, ignoring the other three people at the table who also had a request. Our food was delivered without the 'need anything else right now' check in and we were asked if we'd 'like to order dessert' with no offer of a menu or the options. I could go on and on, but the entire meal just felt like the table was exerting effort while the waitress answered only direct commands.After this recent experience, I am sorry to say that I am not interested in returning to Station at this time, even if that hard to find Saturday evening reservation is available again in the future."
"2.0","I generally like idea of Panera. I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich. It was promptly served piping hot. I would be willing to bet that it was cooked ahead and then zapped in the microwave. If somebody from Panera let's me know that they ARE NOT microwaving there stuff I will take this review down.   What next--hot pockets?"
"3.0","I went to Peppis the other day for lunch and had a decent time. If I could, I would give my turkey sub 5 stars...it was DELICIOUS! The bread was amazing and I was very happy with the meal. The experience on the other hand was a bit rough. It may have been because it was lunch time and the line was literally out the door, but, this is one of those places that you have to know what you are going to get the second you step in line. No time to look at the menu.  I might have missed a sign or two, but I did not know that they only take cash...so I had to step out of line to get money from the onsite ATM, which annoyed everyone - including me. The waitress cleaning tables was a bit snippy as well. Again, I am not going to write the place off - the food was good. Maybe next time the experience will be a bit better."
"4.0","The pho is really great, but not made on the traditional sense. The split rice entrée is also delicious. The owner, Tram, is very personable. You can tell he cares about this business. That it's a part of his family."
"3.0","I went here because of the rave reviews and overall I'd say 'Meh'. Everything from service (for a not busy restaurant) to the actual food was just average. I thought the actual meat portions in the ramen was very, very small; the overall portion was reasonable and fair, just there should have been more pork belly. Skipping the lack of meat, the food was decent; though I liked Ki Ramen in Lawrenceville a lot more for both their ramen and the apps they offered. This place offers a lot more than just ramen, so maybe the other dishes are better. But I won't be ordering ramen here again."
"3.0","Tater Tots. Yes, this bar has tater tots on the menu. Need I say more? As a note, I avoid this and most uber-crowded South Side bars after midnight on a Friday or Saturday. You're either there to be drunk or to be seen - not to get good service.However, if you head to Mario's for happy hour, you'll get a good crowd, good prices on their decent draft selection and some tasty apps. Their insanity wings rival any other bar in the neighborhood (ahem... fatheads) for their level of spiciness. Their nachos can make a dinner for 2. If you stay after happy hour, the prices are still pretty reasonable and the bartenders are still pretty nice. It's a great place to watch a Pens game or a college basketball game.Overall, it's a good weeknight bar with classic hardwood everywhere, nice bathrooms, and TATER TOTS."
"1.0","The only nice things about this place is the outdoor seating on the water, it's convenient for hikers/bikers and it's dog friendly. The food, however, is EXTREMELY overpriced for the quality and quantity!! Probably won't be back. Such a shame, a place like this in the Burgh could have great potential!"
"4.0","Flew in from CA and needed a place for late night dinner and some drinks.  So glad we stumbled into this place!  Grilled cheeses were amazing!  Messy but so rewarding!"
"4.0","If it's summer time you must try Il Tetto at least once. It is a little pricey which is my only complaint but I just love it here. On a nice summer night it is just stunning with the lights and looking at the buildings in the city. One of my newest discoveries about this place is the Tiki Nights every Sunday starting in the Spring. They offer island themed drinks and food. All of the drinks come in super cute glasses. And if it gets too pricey you can always just head down to Emporio and enjoy some meatballs!"
"5.0","Stagioni is definitely a refreshing step up from most other South Side restaurants. We enjoyed a few glasses of wine while sampling a few of the smaller plates and the gnocchi. We ordered one of the bruschetta options and had mixed feelings about it, but everything else was wonderful. I would have been perfectly happy with several orders of the meatballs for my entire meal, but the gnocchi was great as well. And on top of it, we had the best service that I've had in a long time (from both the hostess and waiter). I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys Italian cooking."
"5.0","First time in Pittsburgh and glad I stopped in for dinner. Great sandwiches and home cut fries. Very busy place and I have tasted why."
"1.0","Extremely disappointing. My friends and I went here around 12pm on a Sunday. We were super excited I heard it was really good from the friend we were visiting in Pittsburgh. However, while ordering they were out of many things. I tried getting their banana strawberry smoothie, they were out of bananas. I tried ordering their yogurt which has berries and granola in it, and they were out of both. My friend tried making her own breakfast sandwich and they were out of bacon. Even the homemade juice had very limited options and they are known for it. Overall it looked super cute inside to do homework or catch up with friends. But they need to try harder to keep their food stocked."
"5.0","Ordered a bacon pizza which came over fifteen minutes earlier than projected. Food was hot and fresh, great dough and taste. Awesome pizza spot with quality ingredients, fresh taste and quick delivery."
"2.0","I was really disappointed with this restaurant after it was recommended to me to try it.  First , Spanish food does not consist of cooking them and serving them with cream sauce, they are usually cooked with olive oil and garlic. Second, the place was so small you were practically on top of each other, forget having an intimate date there, this is not the place for you. Third , if the food wasn't impressive enough, we were being served by the snootiest waitress which I think was the worst . If you can't be warm and inviting, don't work in this field , right there you just destroyed my dining experience. I will not be coming back and I will never recommend this place to anyone who asks me."
"2.0","Have been going there a lot since it's convenient and open late at night.  Choices are limited in downtown Pittsburgh.   As mentioned before the food is lower quality than other Fridays.  Service is very mixed.  Sometimes its good and many times it's horrible.  At least I'm familiar with the menu and know what I'm getting most of the time.  I have complained to Corporate several times but never heard back.  Have sent food back to the kitchen several times."
"5.0","The best breakfast&lunch place hands down! Foods are always fresh, the staff is friendly and l can not believe their fast service! My favorite food is south omlette and it was amazing! They put in it steak, mushroom,onion and cheddar and they served it so fast and warm enough! l also eat one every two days bagels and french toastes! They have all tastes for a delicious lunch and breakfast. l do love their backyard, you should have your lunch there, you will see how amazing place it is! Perfect environment, delicious foods!"
"4.0","I could eat here every day.   If I had the patience of a saint and wanted to weigh 400 pounds, that is.   As far as breakfast goes, Pamela's has it covered.   The crepe hotcakes are amazing and they have a pretty good selection of hearty and delicious breakfast fare.   Everything is always well prepared, quick, and flavorful.   It's definitely got a diner feel and they turn tables over quickly, which is good because there is ALWAYS a line. There's really not a lot of room to wait, but people wait.   It's sort of a madhouse, especially if the weather is bad and people don't want to wait outside.   I'm more of a reservation girl and don't have a lot of patience for lines, but this is a place I'll wait for.  Prices are a it higher than diner prices, but not unreasonable.   Payment is CASH ONLY and I'd be sort of surprised to hear that they don't have a lot of people walking out without paying.  You have to sort of fight your way through the crowd of waiting people to the cashier in order to cash out."
"4.0","Luke Wholey's almost goes unnoticed with all that to be seen at The Strip, but am I ever glad that we decided to sit down for lunch last Saturday afternoon. I'll say this, it was no cheap affair, three people each getting meals and drinks landed just under $100, but it was absolutely worth it. Service was also great, despite it being a rather busy day.I had the blackened ahi tuna sandwich and a Bloody Mary. The Bloody Mary was one of the best I've ever had, with a pickle and shrimp to boot, and the tuna was cooked perfectly.That atmosphere and location are ideal, and the food and drink this time around we're very impressive. The only negative I have is based on pricing, $10+ for a Bloody Mary is excessive, and the seafood and sushi is definitely priced at the premium. If you're willing to make an investment for a great meal, I highly, highly recommend."
"3.0","I have probably been here 30 times in the span of my life and I remember when this was the place to go for authentic Italian food. I wish I could say it's still the same. It's really hit or miss these days with an emphasis on miss. And that makes me really sad. My friends and I used to drive in from the suburbs in our early 20s for the amazing dishes they served. Now that I live a block away it's such a disappointment. It makes me wonder what's happening to Little Italy.No idea if or when I'll be back. #sosadaboutit"
"5.0","Chinatown Inn is defiantly my favorite Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. My family had been coming here since it's beginning, the staff is always very friendly and positive. My favorite dish is the Spicy War Shew Guy Chicken (No Lettuce) the pieces of chicken are lightly fried and are always juicy, this brown sauce that is on the chicken is the perfect combination of spicy and savory. They also have hands down the best shrimp egg rolls in the city. The Szechuan Chicken is also delicious. Take it from a Yinzer, give this place a try!"
"5.0","This place is not just a great vegan restaurant, it's a great restaurant. Period.My husband and I have been vegan for 6 years; and the veggie scene in Pittsburgh is getting so exciting. The first time I came to B52, no one even told me it was vegan. My friend just told me that it was Mediterranean; which was totally cool, because I knew that I could at least get hummus and veggies. But when I saw the menu, I died of sheer joy. I could eat EVERYTHING!!! To my pleasant surprise, the owner is also the head chef, and runs the kitchen; not just someone who saw a great location and wanted to capitalize on real estate and pander to the demographic. Meaning, the food is MADE with love, care, and attention to detail. Not frozen food simply heated up and assembled.They make everything IN-HOUSE. Their almond milk, hummus, cashew 'cream' cheese, and baked goods. At this point, I have tried everything on the menu, and have NEVER been disappointed.During Sunday Brunch, if you get there right at 9am, you'll get seated right away. However, the place is also a small café, so groups larger than 4 may have to wait even longer. The place also fills up quick. BUT - worth the wait for the Sourdough Buckwheat Pancakes, which we always get with Blueberries (or you can add bananas, or both). My husband and I always tend to split the Tofu Scramble as well, to satisfy our savory side. Whatever they do to their scrambled tofu is pure magic. The Latkes are also better than any of our old family recipes (but PLEASE do not tell that to my Aunts and Great-Aunts - they might keel over).Also, even if you just go for a coffee (Café Rico - hot - is totally worth a try!!) and Thick Cut Toast, you'll be pleasantly surprised at how full you may be. For lunch - anything on the menu is totally awesome. But the Falafel or Seitan Schwarma sanwiches (with Fries - TOTALLY get the fries!!!) are tied for my favorites. Ever since Station Street Hot Dogs disappeared, I couldn't find a worthy falafel contender. But this falafel is better than anything I've had anywhere. Again - don't tell my Aunts that. Dinner starts at 5pm, and you can't go wrong with a Mezze platter, flatbread, or entree. No matter what I have tried - I roll my eyes back into my head and think, 'How do they do it?!'Desserts - pick ANY of them. And if you don't say, 'this isn't vegan?!' then you can call me any dirty name that you want to. Seriously. My favorites are the Cinnamon Roll and Baklava, but the cookies and brownies are worth sharing as they are dense and delicious. I'm not sharing my Cinnamon Roll though. Get you're own. They also have a quick Grab and Go section at the front to take home any of their great items. We have taken some cashew cheese, hummus, and pitas with us on road trips or for a picnic in the park, and it's the perfect snack to keep us going.On top of the great food, and friendly staff, B52 always seems to be playing kick ass music as well. My husband and I joke that B52 feeds both our stomachs and our souls, as we are usually SoundHounding what's playing through the speakers. Our favorite find - Os Mutantes 'A Mehia Menina' - 60's Brazilian Pop Song. Super fun and catchy.Overall, B52 has replaced the hole in our hearts that Quiet Storm left. Yet, in letting any old things go, you make room for the better."

"5.0","Prior to a recent trip to Pittsburgh, my better half and I were watching some YouTube videos about top things to do while visiting.  Although I have been there countless times, I figured I might discover some new things as well and one of the things that caught our eyes was a video that suggested La Gourmandine!The video made a persuasive case and given that the pastry shop was less than five minutes from our hotel, we made a beeline there after dropping off our bags!Upon entering the shop, you'll see a drool worthy case full of sandwiches and savories, followed by another case full of pastries and sweets.  It was heavenly!  Service was so friendly, too and we even got a free little bite (can't recall what the guy said it was but I believe if you check in on Yelp it offers the same thing).My pain au chocolate was so flaky and the chocolate so delicious, I felt like I was in heaven while eating it.Definitely check out this place if you're downtown.  And based on what fellow Yelper Eileen S told me, there are a few locations in the surrounding area so look for them if you're anywhere near Pittsburgh!"
"3.0","OK - first the good news.  The food is very good and I have been there just twice.  But the service was pretty close to awful on my most recent - and last visit.  Was there for take out and after waiting over 40 minutes I asked if someone could check on my order.  One of the staff came out shortly with my food.  You would think they would have wanted to check me out as quickly as possible - but that took another 10 minutes to accomplish.  Not good because I made the fact that i was not pleased pretty obvious to a nearly full dinning room.  Eating out is a choice for us we love to cook - and I am too old to spend our money where the food and the SERVICE are not good."
"2.0","Way too overpriced and nothing special with the atomosphire. Foods are Okey and presentation is good but nothing authentic by any means."
"5.0","This is our favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. We've dined here 2 dozenThis is where we bring folks who come to visit. This is where both of us choose to go for our birthdays. We have brought a bunch of friends here for their first Turkish cuisine experience. Everyone loves it.GREAT food and super friendly service. I always get the Adana Kebab. It is expertly prepared. I lived in Adana, Turkey, for 2 years. This dish is spot on. My spouse always gets the chicken kebab. It is always moist and delicious. The accompanying rice and salad are great.We always start with the Shepard Salad and hummus. Both are perfect. Both are meant to be shared.The Turkish tea is served in small, bottomless cups. And, the rice pudding is scrumptious. They also have a nice outdoor eating area.Plus, the location near downtown Shadyside, the best little community in Pittsburgh, makes this an incredible night out. Parking can be tight and may require some patience. Yet it's well worth the effort.Highly recommend.- - - - - - 10/12/19: Ate dinner here again, we we have a dozen times in 3.5 years. Outstanding meal. Had the same thing, except had to pass on the rice pudding. Best restaurant in Pittsburgh."
"3.0","I came here with my fiancé for dinner on a Monday. I really loved the decor, thinking its hip and unique bringing back the old Pittsburgh train station feel. Food though, I don't think it can level to Meat & Potatoes standard...M&P feels more up-scale and more of a true gastropub to me. I ordered the Station Burger, not sure if the meat is the freshest and doesn't seem like they ground their own meat in house. But oh well, I have high foodie standards. Certainly not disappointed but not a wow either, critically speaking :)"
"1.0","I'm a vegetarian and ordered a vegetarian meal, and there was chicken in it. The first time I asked the server assured me it was paneer. The second time the server claimed it was fine because the 'sauce is the same anyway'. Then the manager was rude. First and last time I've ever walked out of a restaurant."
"4.0","Great environment, very reasonable prices. Went there to try their espresso and my gf got a regular drip and the total was under $5. Employees were very friendly & welcoming. Didn't try their food but the menu looked delicious, they also have pastries on display. Parking lot on the side was very convenient."
"2.0","I took my entire family here for brunch when they were in town from Florida. I had heard some good things from friends and decided to give it a try.After an hour and a half wait (thanks to No Wait we got in line at home) we grabbed a table in a very crammed, hot dining area. It was so loud that we couldn't really hear each other--our server virtually disappeared after taking our order, leaving us with empty coffees...The food was fine, nothing to write home about.All in all, I probably won't head back on my own accord. Maybe I owe it a second chance?"
"4.0","Yes I am a fan of Mario's! Last year I was quite the regular. I knew all the bartenders and would come for every Pens game or football game. One main reason I would frequent so often was because it was my hangout where everyone knows your name and I wanted to catch the Hockey players when they were out. OK I was a little star struck but it wears off!This bar was voted best college bar and sports bar of 2010 so I think that says a lot. Last year I was in party mode and if you are into that scene here is where the meat market takes place. Jocks and those chasing jocks from neighboring colleges pretty much live here. It is a busy bar almost any night of the week so if you want to be immersed in a crowd and you have someone visiting from out of town bring them here instead of some dead dive bar.I believe that Mario Lemieux owns this bar so it is decorated in player Jerseys and sports memorabilia. The space is big so you will always have a view of the game no matter where you are. TVs are all over. I prefer to sit at the bar but if you want to do that, get there a little earlier, very early if you are planning for playoffs. They have tots! I love tater tots and they've got em' yumm. They also have many more apps and bar food. I don't consider it to be fine dining it's comfort food that tastes good with beers. Goblet night, $2 beers during game time, trivia, random goof off night, tasty shooters(blue sweet tarts)...those are the things that make Mario's shine. I have to get my game face on because Mario's it's ON!"
"2.0","My husband and I love Korean food so we were super excited to try this place, especially after all the great reviews. Perhaps our wings were made wrong but these were not good. We each took one bite, he spit it out on a napkin and I made a face of disgust as I swallowed it. We ended up throwing them away, I don't believe we have ever done that before. They were soggy, overly sweet and tasted like paper, I really  I don't  know how else to describe it. The only reason why I'm giving this place two stars is because my strawberry milk tea was good."
"5.0","Our first time here for breakfast. I had Brie and apple Crep which was delicious and my husband had madetranean omelette. Both dishes were fresh and delicious and beautifully presented. Coffee and juices were fresh. Our servers Eto and Connor were friendly. This place is clean and warm. Would love to go back with friends and family."
"5.0","Best Thai in the states!!!! Doesn't get any better than here! The owners are Thai & they cook all the meals here themselves. Truly wonderful owners. Very kind people & the authentic taste of their foods is so out of this world!! They should charge much more for all their dishes... AND I'd pay more!!"
"5.0","We found this place on Grub Hub and we LOVE IT! They have the best pizza and the wings are really good too! I highly recommend it!"
"5.0","Outstanding. Maybe the best meal I've ever had in Pittsburgh. We got (in very, very rough order of how much we liked them):SobrasadaOxtailSerrano hamSalt cod croquettesOctopusBeef tartareBeetsOlivesPatatas bravasChurrosQuesoThis was a ton of food for two people -- we were both incredibly stuffed after, and yet there were still more things on the menu we would have liked to have tried (eg brussel sprouts, ribs, and especially more charcuterie). That said, we really liked all of the above, and I'd be fine getting any of those dishes (besides for maybe the queso) again.Highly recommend this place."
"5.0","One of the best restaurants I've been to in a long time. Sophia was one of the best servers I've ever had in any restaurant & we eat out a lot. She was friendly, enthusiastic, knowledgeable about the restaurant & menu, checked on us multiple times to make sure we had what we needed and enjoyed everything we had. The food selection was fantastic - a great representation of global street cuisine. We had several things that we shared. The lobster crepe with sherry cream sauce was my favorite. It melted in my mouth & the flavor was out of this world. Huarache was good. Didn't know it would come on something similar to flatbread. The barbacoa on it was very good. My husband loved his slow roasted pork sandwich with broccoli rabe. He said it was one of the best pork sandwiches he's had and he's obsessed with pork. My mom had the Murica filet mignon burger & loved it. Next time I'd try the duck fat poutine. Will definitely return and highly recommend it."
"5.0","Amazing flatbread, perfectly cooked every time, and has never messed up my very complex 'Make-Your-Own' online order. Tony is incredibly kind, generous and attentive to detail. We order 8-9 flatbreads per working lunch a week and he has never messed up one order. They are made very quickly and he even labels the boxes for us! Thank you Tony for going above and beyond, your flatbreads are delicious!"
"1.0","Placed order and never delivered. Waited 2.5 hours and Pizza Romano stopped answering the phone? Sometimes, could hear girls talking on other end, unaware that they had answered. Only successful because it's in a city; terrible business and quality."
"1.0","Worst Christmas ever...coming from out of town we wanted to watch the Steeler game and this was open. First they ran out of ranch dressing after we order all foods that we use it...who runs out of ranch?? Go get some?? Then I said please no lettuce or tomato on my sandwich...she drops it off and says sorry they put it on then walks away..then my sisters burger was so gross we all tried it it tasted old and like a ball of salt and too well done and we normally don't like to send back food that's why I kept my sandwich but her burger was so bad we had to send it back...whatever bad experience and bad food we chalked it up to...however, now my sister has food poisoning she has been up all night sick and not left the restroom...seriously like ruined our night and our Christmas her getting sick...we were just trying to do something different since our dad just passed two months ago...we should have stayed home and cooked..."
"1.0","Absolutely Awful. Luckily it was cheap, so I don't feel like I wasted too much money.I ordered the clam chowder- which had no clams in it and was like eating a bowl of mucus.Then the calami- tasteless little rings they were.And then the entree arrived- 'Award winning' Maryland crab cakes. Where did they get this award? The terrible food olympics? Wow these crab cakes were THE WORST. Like crab cakes you buy at the grocery store in the frozen aisle and heat up in the oven. Had no flavor, they were all breading, and smelled like dirty laundry.I asked for a to go box and threw them away in the trash can outside."
"5.0","The only place I go for Thai in Pittsburgh.I mean, it's amazing. We do take out from here a few times a month, and it's always incredibly good at a great price. We usually mix it up with what we get, but my absolute go to's are the Pad Kee Mow and the General Tso's Tofu (DON'T JUDGE ME!! I KNOW IT'S NOT ACTUAL THAI FOOD!!). As a vegetarian, I've encountered less than inspired tofu dishes, but honestly, their Gen. Tso Tofu is amazeballs. No joke, I've ordered this for very, very non-vegetarian family members, and they scarfed it down thinking it was chicken. The food is always freshly made and high quality. It never tastes greasy or old.The curries all great and each definitely have a unique flavor. I'm pretty sure I've tried them all (except for the duck for vegetarian reasons), and I really love all of them, but the pumpkin is my slight favorite.It's family owned and operated, so you really need to go there and support them! It's BYOB, delish and try the Yum Tofu salad!"
"5.0","One of my favorite bars in the city! Their seasonal drinks are to die for and often you won't find anything like them being made anywhere else in the city. Currently they have a sweet potato bourbon cocktail happening topped with an actual toasted marshmallow. There's also the warm apple cider which I would like to drink every day this winter.I could go on and on about the drinks but their food is a win too with an also seasonally changing menu. All of their ravioli dishes have been excellent and I've had three different versions of them, right now it is one with mushroom which typically I'm not the biggest fan of but they know how to make me love them.Also, the atmosphere is great, warm, inviting and with board games. You really can't go wrong. I would absolutely recommend everyone check out this spot."
"5.0","In my opinion TCG is the best of all the upscale steakhouses in Pittsburgh. The waiters and waitresses are professional, super friendly, and know everything about the food they are serving you, as they should. Their assistants are also very professional and attentive, You'll never ask for a refill of water. The atmosphere is dark and sexy, many beautiful paintings hang on the walls. Best steaks you can get in Pittsburgh, hands down. I recommend the filet, gorgonzola and truffle crusted with cabernet reduction. The lobster mac and cheese is sinfully rich and filled with huge chunks of lobster. The truffle fries are as addicting as crack cocaine and the lobster bisque is perfect. One of my favorite restaurants in any city."
"5.0","The banana chocolate chip pancakes are the ultimate evolution of the pancake. Not since mankind first invented batter has their been a more revolutionary flavor experienced by a breakfast-seeking individual. These compliments are coming from someone who actively avoids breakfast and doesn't take pancakes very seriously. This endorsement could not come from a harsher critic of breakfast.In other news, the corned beef hash is very good. The service is friendly and the space is nice. Protip: Go when they open to avoid the line because they fill up fast."
"5.0","the Best in the city. I'm glad we finally have a great Gyro place in Oakland."
"5.0","What to say? First time here and very impressed with the place. Very eccentric and makes you feel like you're visiting your Italian grandmother's house for dinner. I had the chicken and sausage ziti dish and the spaghetti with meatballs. The chicken ziti was fantastic! The sweet Italian sausage added a nice spiciness I like in Italian dishes and the spaghetti... Wow! Meatballs the size of softballs! Right amount of sauce and spice. Service was par excellente! Adele and Tiara are very attentive and plesant. Both of them made our visit memorable. I will definitely come back here. Would like to try lunch here."
"3.0","So this review is purely based on Rialto's delivery. This was my favorite place to get pizza from in college. i had LOTs of rialto's. my fav was the ranch steak pizza as it had fries on it  AND ranch dressing. what's not to like?The normal steak pizza is also quite good."
"5.0","Peppi's is delicious. I ordered the #7 (RoethlisBurger) which is blend of hamburger and sausage with american cheese and egg. It was fantastic.This is exactly the type of sandwich I have been looking for in Pittsburgh... unabashedly unhealthy and irrefutably delicious. It reminds me of a somewhat better version of my favorite sandwich chain from Detroit, Tubby's. In fact, I intend to give Tubby's bottled dressing a whirl on my next order from Peppi's."
"5.0","Not just tea - but also great tea! Had a fantastic grilled sandwich, lemon green tea with fresh shaved ginger, and lovely Italian mele. They feature both soy and almond milk in addition to dairy, have local honey and stevia, and green takeout containers. My mouth and tummy are having a VERY good day! Service was prompt and extremely friendly and the space is gorgeous - open, natural wood floors, exposed brick, tons of light, and soft jazz in the background - this place is not just tea."
"2.0","My first review ever. I ordered online and the order was to be ready around 4:20. I arrive at 4:20 and the staff continues to stand there and clean off the counters without any type of acknowledgment whatsoever. Finally someone comes over and I reply I'm waiting for an online order . She continues to tell me oh , the salad isn't made yet. Keep in mind there are TWO people in the entire place ! Insane. Lazy lazy lazy ."
"5.0","This place is awesome! Huge slices with great taste. We always have to stop in for a slice when in the South Side."
"2.0","Great location and decor. Found the food to be very decent but not outstanding...a little over-priced for the quality. The craft beer selection is impressive but the marketing folks of this chain obviously don't want you to know the size of glass they use for each of the 60 or so beers on tap. There's plenty of room in the description of each beer to note the pour size. The ABVs are all noted plainly. Most bars with good craft selections plainly state the size of glass used for each. Go figure why City Works doesn't print it on their menu. $$$$$"
"5.0","Worth the wait! There was quite a wait, which is understandable because this place is so delicious. Luckily, there is a coffee shop within walking distance and a park up the street. Just be prepared to wait an hour or two depending on when you get there. You do have to wait outside because there is no where to really wait inside. However, if you want a divine brunch you should definitely check this place out!I had the french toast and it was amazing. I had such a hard time deciding what to order because it all looked delicious. Their menu changes a bit too so there are different things to try depending when you go. I liked their menu because it was unique and a bit more special than your standard brunch menu. They definitely give you a good amount of food for the price. It smells so yummy that you get more and more hungry while you wait. It is a bright, little brunch cafe. There are several tables in the front room and a little narrow room in the back with more intimate tables. There is one bathroom for both men and women that was not very clean. I wouldn't recommend coming here with a large group. I would say there was maybe one table that held possibly 6 or 7 people, but the rest of the groups were 2 and up to 4. The staff was friendly and checked on us an average amount. We did have to wait to have our waters refilled a few times, but other than that no complaints. I would definitely wait again to eat here."
"5.0","Love the food at this informal downtown place. The menu is interesting and everything is extremely well prepared. Try the palak paneer with a side of raita or the mango lamb curry. All delicious. And the naan is excellent too. It's high on our list of Best Indian restaurants anywhere and we are lucky to have such a great place right here at home. Pro tip: if you're going to a game come early and eat here. There's never a wait."
"5.0","Everything was delightful. Had no idea about this place, but wanted something good in the neighborhood for a night out. How nice to walk to a delicious meal in a cozy atmosphere. The restaurant was packed but we were able to sit at the bar. Bartender was friendly and charming. We had the chicken liver mousse to start, which was SO good. Seriously, the I could eat it with a spoon... But luckily it comes with crispy toasted sourdough. :) Entrees were great, too. I had the tagliatelle and my boyfriend had the pork loin. We will definitely come back! Great place to take guests to the city who want something off the beaten path but as good as you'd get in any bigger city."
"5.0","We were looking for a place to eat near a concert we were attending, and were happy to find Kassab's. I've loved food from that region ever since spending a few months in Palestine years ago, but where we live we rarely have the opportunity to get any. The falafel and shawarma exceeded expectations, and the very reasonable prices were an added bonus! We will make it a point to go back to Kassab's whenever we are in the area!"
"5.0","I order from here all the time, excellent service and food. Food is hot so be aware I get a 4 out of 10 and it's still spicy, delicious always tho!"
"3.0","The food was excellent and our waitress was helpful with suggestions. We waited about 25 minutes for our check once we were finished and tried to make eye contact with the wait staff. Next time, I will just order take out."
"5.0","The Roethlisburger sandwich is beyond delicious if you like Pittsburgh style sandwiches with more than enough toppings and sauces like I do!I always go to the Strip District location. The staff there is young and more than friendly. I always enjoy a place with self-serve drink fountains since I am one of those people who usually pisses off a waitress since I'm in need of refill after refill during my feast!You can read more about Peppi's on my blog at http://midnightguru.com/place.php?id=277"
"2.0","I've been here before and the food was good, overpriced but good. Today, however, I sat down for breakfast that I was really looking forward to but was left completely unsatisfied. I ordered an omelette and it was bland. No salt or seasoning, bad texture, the side salad was very sad. The only redeeming component was the coffee. The service was poor as well. The 'server' seemed irritated the whole time. I will not be returning."
"5.0","What a little gem!Ordered the Sandwich & Drink special for only $7.05! The servers were friendly and helpful. Some of the baguettes are pre-made with butter (which I can't have for lactose). But the server offered to make me one fresh with mayonnaise instead! I had the Prosciutto and Pickle - bread was light and fresh but had that good French chew to it. Meat and pickle complemented each other perfectly.Nice and chill vibe. I'd come back."
"4.0","Salem's always satisfies my craving of hot flavorful fresh Indian food. They have a parking lot, which is great since I am not a fan of parallel parking. Once you go in, just get in line to order. I was a bit overwhelmed the first time I went since they have so many options in the case and the menu hanging. They are also usually pretty busy. You can eat in or take out. I ordered their chicken biriyani which they had in the case and then ordered lamb biriyani which they said would take about 15 min to make. It was totally worth it because that biriyani had so much more flavor than the one in the case. Since it was takeout I just asked for sides of the chili chicken, butter chicken, tandoori chicken, and lamb curry, because they usually just put it over rice. Also I recommend getting their naan, it's huge and fresh. All their dishes are pretty good and are great for take out. Prices are also very reasonable for the huge portions, you will definitely have left overs!"
"5.0","This is an excellent burger place in Pittsburgh! The beef is really flavorful. The different burgers have some unique toppings that all meld really well together. The fries taste homemade and are also very crispy which I love. My favorites are the Maggie's Farm and Shadyside. Also have never had to wait long to be seated, which is rare for Lawrenceville, especially given how great the food is."
"4.0","Excellent cocktails, great beer selection, and great food. The location is fun. Easygoing staff. Take the monongahela incline from the station square area to the Mt. Washington neighborhood. There is absolutely nothing of interest in station square. It is just a bunch of chain garbage, So take the trouble and go up the hill. The Summit is worth it."
"3.0","I was looking forward to trying this restaurant.  I am in Bloomfield frequently but rarely get to try the restaurants in the area.  I was really excited to have a date night with my hubby here last Friday.  We made a reservation, which was good.  It was pretty crowded. It is a BYOB, which is my favorite!  2$ cork fee per person, is totally worth it!  We were sat right away and had a great server.  She was very smiley and helpful.  The restaurant is not too small, but it is a nice intimate size.  The server brought us some really yummy white bean dip.  It was my favorite part of the meal!  The dip had a nice olive oil on top and a sweet balsamic also.  It was delicious!  So I was just a little disappointed by my meal.  I got the gnocchi which is one of my favorite pastas!  The pasta was cooked well, not too 'gummy.'  The sauce was.....well underwhelming.  It was ok.  I had to season it, because it really didnt have enough salt and pepper on it.  My husband got the duck.  He was also underwhelmed with his dinner.  His potatoes were under seasoned and the duck was VERY fatty.  (More than duck at most restaurants)  I would definitely give this place another try, because so many people seem to like it.  Maybe we caught it on an off night?"
"5.0","Eating here right now and I had to write a review. We waiting in line for DeLuca's but it was super long so we looked next door and saw their special of 2 Eggs of Beef Brisket Hash. Done deal, we went inside.We had a big group but the cashier/staff were SUPER nice. Like incredibly nice and pleasant. Food was INCREDIBLE. Brisket hash was amazing. Blueberry Ricotta pancakes were incredible as well.HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Screw DeLuca's, just stop next door and skip the wait."
"5.0","Went to a late lunch, so my daughter ordered the Greek wrap and I ordered the spinach and feta omelette with mushrooms:) it was very good, we split so we could try both. The Greek wrap is full of flavor. The portions are huge and the price is very affordable. We will definitely come back."
"5.0","Delicious corned beef sandwiches and friendly staff. I loved this place so much I visited twice on my 4 day stay."
"5.0","If you order something spicy here, it comes spicy. The pumpkin curry is interesting and definitely worth a shot. Staff is very friendly and funny. They'll play with your baby while you eat."
"5.0","Cafe Cravings is Mt. Washington's little Gem. Really awesome staff and excellent roast beef paninis/ iced coffee/ breakfast sandwiches! 5 stars all the way!"
"1.0","Currently writing this review as I sit at he bar waiting for food I ordered 30 minutes ago with an empty drink in front of me as the manager stands 2 feet in front of me and hasn't acknowledged me once. Just looking at liquor counts. The bartender has had his back to me for 15 minutes talking to a waitress. Another waitress is just standing on the floor in the middle texting.  Yup sucks here. If you are staying at the waterfront don't come here. Just don't. Trust me. I live off of Yelp and in 5 years I can count on 1 hand how many times I've posted a negative review."
"3.0","I just had to try the fries..  want to see what the buzz was all about.   Decent deal $1 fries with side of nacho cheese.  It was a small amount. The fries have a little bit of season salt on them.  They were flavorful. They are probably better than some other fast food restaurants - definitely different and cooked properly.    They were good - but not life changing."
"5.0","I used to go to Sammy's Famous Corned Beef and the food is excellent! I went downtown to get a sandwich and it was shut down and I couldn't find them.About 3 months ago I found a Sammy's Famous Corned Beef on Liberty & Ninth Ave,I was so happy to find Sammy's I had to stop and get Sammy's Famous Corned Beef Sandwich! Now I try to go at least twice a week to get the best sandwich & it comes with a pickle and I ask for the mustard on the side!"

"5.0","Loved this place. Creative menu, good drinks, friendly wait staff. I had the Pan con Chicharron. Pork Belly, sweet potato paste, onion, cilantro chilies,on a roll with really good fries! Dish is from Cercadodelima, Lima. Had a bourbon cocktail special from the board which was spot on. Can't wait to go back and try the other sandwiches."
"2.0","Ordered the Sapporo miso ramen. Very mediocre and the taste of the garlic butter overpowered everything else."
"5.0","Classic Pittsburgh staple for breakfast. 10/10 when you ask where is the best place to get breakfast in Pittsburgh, you're going to hear Pamela's. It's no surprise when you walk in and eat why this is the case. There are a number of Pamela's throughout the city, each with its own personality and vibe. But at the end of the day, one thing remains constant and that's the quality of the food.I'm personally biased towards diners, and being to so many I've seen it all from down right disgusting to practically perfect. Pamela's is practically perfect when you think of a diner. Quick, delicious, no-frill American favorites. Two things that are a must every time you come are the Lyonnaise potatoes and the crepe-style hotcakes. Trust me, you will not be disappointed.I wish that I could keep going on about how great it is here, but I think you should come and see for yourself. Happy dining!"
"3.0","I am giving this restaurant 3 stars not because the food isn't good, because it is, but because for a fish place they should care more about the sea than they apparently do. We had glasses of water and cocktails, all came with plastic straws in them. When I asked the server about this she couldn't be bothered. I guess Wholey's didn't see the recent article on a pregnant whale who washed ashore with a belly full of plastics. If customers are the driving force behind straws in drinks then switch to paper."
"1.0","The blueberry pancake was not good. The outside was sort of burnt. The staff were not friendly! I don't recommend the place for parties bigger than 8 even with reservation. You have to arrive about 45 minutes early, otherwise you spend most of the time in line and they ask you out in less than an hour.  They even did not bring my friend's food and he had to ask for a refund!"
"5.0","I came here for my birthday after trying to go to like 3 other places that were huge failures. The bartender was great. The drinks were delicious. My favorite tapas was the queso. It was the best value for the money. Huge bowl of cheese and olive oil and bread. You definitely will need extra bread tho, which is like $2. The fancy Spanish cider with the arm length pour is very interesting and if you ask they will explain it to you...it's super funky and delicious. Gin and tonic dedicated menu available and the gin selection is not to be f*cked with. They have the best selection in Pittsburgh by far! If you like gin and meats and cheese, you should definitely make this your next stop."

"1.0","I was back in Pittsburgh for the weekend. I hadn't been to the Oyster House since I was a small child.  I remember the amazing fish sandwiches from back in the day.  Definitely not the place that I remember.  The waitress seemed disinterested at best.  You had to be buzzed into the men's bathroom.   We then discovered that there was no sink in the bathroom.   That has to be a code violation.  We were lead to the back part of the old restaurant that had been turned into some sort of a Zombie room experience to wash our hands.  I can't make this stuff up.  With so many other wonderful places to try in Pittsburgh I don't know why anyone would visit here. If you want dingy and dirty with average food this is your place.  If you want nice seafood in Pittsburgh, go to Rolands in the Strip District.   We should have walked across the square and gone to Primanti's Brothers instead. It never disappoints.   The good reviews for this place that have been left by others are truly mystifying."
"4.0","I can't wait to try this place again! I'm VERY picky about my burgers... I'd say I'm disappointed in most burgers that I try. Luckily, my meal at Burghers did not fall into that same sad category! I went with the Fox Chapel. The burger was a blend of beef and mushrooms, topped with goat cheese, greens, balsamic vinaigrette, pickled onion and avocado. I added a fried egg on top because I can't eat a burger without it. They serve their patties in a 'smash burger' style where they come out pretty thin. I was worried that would automatically translate to the meat being overcooked but was pleasantly surprised that my medium rare order still had pink!I went for a side of Mac and cheese instead of fries. It wasn't that hot when it came out, but the flavor was great and the noodles were still a little al dente, which I love. I'd try it again. I also tried a bite of my friend's fried chicken sandwich and liked it a lot. Our server, Bridget, was wonderful. Friendly, polite and easily answered all of our menu questions. Note: it's BYOB for now but they should be getting their liquor license shortly! There is a great bar space with the potential for a huge draft list. I'll be back once that happens!"
"5.0","we have only gotten take-out here, but we always get the pad thai (amazing) and the red curry (so great).  and fast!  give them a ring then leave the house (2 miles) to pick it up.  always ready and hot."
"4.0","The service is prompt and they keep you moving don't be turned away by the long lines at the door.  The prices are extremely fair too, coming from comparing this to brunch spots in Denver.  The portions are huge and just knocking off a star for how greasy/heavy it all was.  If that's the kind of food you're looking for, this is is!The short/tall stacks are the flat laying hotcakes you'll see in pics, while the specialty are the rolled up ones you see.  Came here the morning after Girasole while Bryan was TDY to Pittsburgh."
"5.0","So I have attempted to write this review on several occasions...with intent of reliving my first experience at Morcilla...and then my first and my second experiences at Morcilla...I had a list of all 500 items I ordered and planned to regale and delight by detailing every nuance of every dish. Well, now there are too many items I've eaten and who has the time? So here are my cliff notes: The food is amazing. The space is intimate. You can spend a ton of money or a modest amount, player's choice. If you are given a lemon to squeeze on something, use it. If you have a picky spouse, ditch them (or lie to them about the dish if you can get away with it). If you are given the opportunity to go, do it."
"3.0","I would love to give this place a four and a half star rating for authentic delicious pho and spring rolls & the wonderful vegan selections, however waiting 40 mins for the meal as well as our water never being refilled brings my rating down. If you're not seriously hungry or in a hurry, you may fare a bit better. Always feel as though I'm dining in someone's living room, here. Quaint little Viet eatery."
"3.0","So apparently this is the best breakfast in Pittsburgh? Alright! Well, it isn't bad. Three stars seems a little low but four feels too high. I got Gail's favorite eggs (scrambled eggs with cream cheese and scallions) and they were pretty good. I was hoping the cream cheese and scallions would be blended in, alas, they were just on top. Still a good combo, though. Their famous potatoes really are amazing, definitely the highlight of the meal! My friend got the corned beef hash and it was UBER SALTY. Like, super ridiculously salty. I know hash usually tends to have a lot of salt but this was outta control. I like that they have rye toast. I don't like that they have Pepsi products and super rude employees. Ya win some, ya lose some, I guess."
"5.0","It seems that my experience here isn't consistent with many of the other reviewers here, because I thought this location has great service and food. The employees I did interact with were very friendly, gracious, and efficient. Even better, the interior of the cafe is completely updated and clean, with plenty of tables to sit at. There are kiosks to order your food at, in case the lines for the registers are too long, which is helpful. I'm unsure if my experience was an anomaly, but I hope not!"
"2.0","The 'All You Can Eat Crab Legs' seriously drew my mom & I in and we couldn't have been more disappointed with our experience. First mine came out on a dirty plate. I only know it was dirty bc under my cup of broccoli there were dried ketchup smear stains. A little horrifying but I transferred my food to another plate and moved on. The crab legs were wonderful (which is the only reason this is getting 2 stars instead of 1) but they brought us out our second round of crab legs which my mom& i couldn't finish. We picked at one on top each removing a leg from the main chunk and put a few scraps back on the plate when we were stuffed and proceeded to asked for a box. The waitress told us she couldn't do that and that boxes for half eaten crab legs isn't allowed. My mom explained that we literally touched all of them and she wasn't sure why they couldn't let us keep the food we touched and the waitress said 'Sorry that's the rules ' and grabbed the plate and walked away. We stayed to finish our wine only to watch them bring the EXACT SAME PLATTER with our half mutilated crab legs on top out to the table next to us for their second round. I am completely horrified & probably planning on calling the health department. My mom and I are clean & healthy individuals but if we weren't the innocent family next to us would've been exposed to god only knows what. Literally appalling."
"4.0","Two words: s'mores fondue. It was everything I wanted in life and more. The rest of the menu is pretty fancy and they have some great food but the lovely chocolate and marshmallow goodness of the s'mores fondue just filled my food-loving soul. Also a great selection of beers on tap; I've enjoyed all the stouts I have tried - personal favorite would be 'Sweet Baby Jesus' a peanut butter and chocolate stout, which can do no wrong. Trivia night has a great atmosphere! The hosts are enthusiastic and welcoming and do a good job of keeping the crowd happy and entertained."
"2.0","With all of the amazing restaurant options in Pittsburgh, you can do far better than Sausalido.I want to begin this review by saying that what really upset my group was the bad service and overall unprofessional nature of the staff.  We overheard a member of the kitchen staff using profanity to describe our table, and it was obvious that they all just wanted us to leave (we had a later reservation on a Friday night). However, our server literally disappeared for a half an hour after clearing our table, so we couldn't have paid if we wanted to (which we desperately did at that point - they seriously made us feel so uncomfortable).I saw on another review that someone's experience was interrupted with a screaming match between the kitchen and the front of the house, so it's my guess that professionalism isn't really paramount here. So, now on to the actual food.  The white bean dip, which everyone raves about, was definitely great and a nice touch.  The entrees ranged from not that great to pretty good.  The menu itself just wasn't very interesting and there were few unique items listed.  Someone at my table had pumpkin ravioli, which were obviously filled with canned pumpkin that was probably bought at Trader Joe's or Giant Eagle.  I guess it's hard to expect fresh pumpkin at this time of year though! (Which is why it probably shouldn't be on the menu... but I digress.)Overall, the menu was average, the food was mediocre, and the service was deplorable.  If you're looking for a great BYO Italian restaurant at this price range, there are far, far better options.  E2, Piccolo Forno, or even La Tavola on Mt. Washington come to mind... do yourself a favor and go to one of those!"
"2.0","Not really sure what the fuss is all about here but we left before we could get into the food process. We came here at normal dinner time hours because the reviews looked great. We walked into a restaurant that had two people in it. Not a good sign around dinner time. The 'sushi bar' is about 6 feet wide and looks like it was an afterthought. This place is clearly a bar. The restaurant had TVs all over the place and the actual bar was almost the length of the restaurant. Clearly their focus. After we decided, based on observation, to not eat here we decided to have a drink while we looked for our next spot. My drink was not good. Poor flavor and no alcohol at all. I took two sips just to be sure and I was done. Fair enough that we didn't eat here but after some observations we decided to skip it. Maybe we missed something but our experience wasn't good."
"1.0","Don't eat here if you have an allergy or some food sensitivity. Damn shame as this place was always my favorite and choices in Pittsburgh are limited but I'll never come back."
"5.0","Wish they had this place back home in CA! Love discovering places to get a healthy meal while traveling for business. This place also offered some indulgences in the form of burgers, fries & grilled cheeses, so it's the best of both worlds. Affordable prices too.I've been to plenty of build-your-own salad places, but this one takes the cake! They have tons of ingredient options: fresh fruits & veggies, different cheeses, beans, crunchies & plenty of creative dressings (I tried the Agave Chili Lime...slightly sweet with a little zip, yum!). My only complaint was that a few veggies looked less than fresh (broccoli w/ brown edges, slimy mushrooms), but I could've just caught them on a bad day. They will chop the ingredients into small, medium or large pieces based on your preference & then toss with your dressing. Another time I went in, I had the Broccauliflower Grilled Cheese...it was epic. Golden brown, perfectly crispy & cheesy. The chunks of broccoli & cauliflower inside added nice texture & made me feel a little less guilty about hoovering the whole sandwich haha. You could tell the fries were homemade...they sort of reminded me of In-N-Out Burger's. Will definitely be back next time I'm in the 'Burgh!"
"5.0","Yes. Definitely best in PGH. I go here evertime I'm close, or when I'm jonesing for it, which is at least once a week. It's soooooo goood. I always try the special. You can't go wrong here get whatever u want."
"2.0","Girasole had a cute atmosphere, great service, but the food was just okay, rather bland even."
"5.0","Genoa is amazing!!! I've been in Pittsburgh for a couple of weeks for work. I've gone to Genoa just about every one of toes nights. Great food no matter what you order, and an awesome full bar as well. Amanda and Ashley are awesome bartenders. If you're in the area, this is a MUST STOP. Seems like a great place to watch football, GO CHARGERS, or the Penguins game! Thank you Amanda, Ashely, and Billy for making me feel at home out here in Pittsburgh!!!!!!!!!!! I'll miss you 3."
"5.0","Wow. Visited the strip today and picked up some take-out for a late dinner tonight.  I will say that this was the best take out food we've ever eaten.  This was the first time we have been to Salem's (It is pronounced Sah-leems', we asked the guy.)As others have noted, it is large inside, casual, and cafeteria style.  Very basic but very clean and we will definitely eat there at some point in the future.  Selections today were all varieties of chicken and we ordered a half rotisserie chicken dinner (the chicken was gorgeous, how often can you say that about chicken???) that came with rice and veggies.  Also picked up a gyro and some spinach pies.  We shared everything, did not finish it all but tried hard because it was all absolutely delicious.  We loved it and will be back."
"5.0","We've been looking for a perfect thin crust pizza nearby, and we found it. We had no issues with ordering/delivery, and we'll definitely be ordering again."
"4.0","Best Korean style fried chicken in Pittsburgh! The chicken is crispy and well seasoned. There are two flavor sweet spicy and ginger soy. I'm not a big fam of their sweet and spicy. I think it taste weird compare to other KFC that I have had in the past in other cities or countries. I wish the pickled radish would just come standard with fried chicken but you have to pay extra for that.I only ordered for pickup but the seating area is limited"
"2.0","I went here with some coworkers for happy hour and was not so impressed. The restaurant itself has a nice location overlooking Market Square, but the service and food were not great.We took advantage of the happy hour special on margaritas and those were decent. Everyone enjoyed their drinks, which were huge and pretty strong.Appetizers are also half-off during happy hour, so we decided to order a bunch to split for dinner. Among the things I tried were the sopecitos; four thick corn tortillas that were topped (one each) with chicken, steak, carnitas, and chorizo. The meat was okay, but the tortillas did not taste fresh. Also, the dish was only lukewarm when served.I also tried the empanadas which were okay. I ordered them with beef. There really isn't much I can say, they were just bland and 'meh.'There were a few other dishes that were not very memorable. The one thing that we all loved were the flautas. I wish we had just gotten several plates of these instead of everything else!We also had issues with the service. The food took almost an hour (for appetizers!) and one of the dishes was incorrect once it was finally brought out. I sent it back and did not request a replacement, but the incorrect dish was still on my check. I had them remove it but the whole experience was annoying."
"5.0","For years I had longed to take on the RoethlisBurger, but Peppi's hours aren't the most convenient for me. That is until a Saturday evening at Altar Bar with Icarus Witch and Kamelot caused Kay and I to track down dinner in the Strip District. And there it was, Peppi's. And they were...open?'Yeah, 'til 8PM,' a guy behind the counter said. 'But the sign says...''Oh, ignore that. What'll it be, man?' Kay was frightened of the RoethlisBurger, so when I ordered it, she ran to The Clown across the street. After the fellow took my order, I was given a ticket, and was told to sit down and relax. As I waited, I took in the surroundings, gazing at the sports memorabilia and photos of patrons both ordinary and famous. Just as hunger pangs assailed my belly, there it was, enveloped in a paper plate in front of me: A homonculous of loose meat a la Maid-Rite gone malevolent. Ground beef, hot sausage, onions, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, scrambled eggs, and 'Merican cheese were all packed into a bread that was as flaxen as a Valkyrie and as airy as the morning mist. Upon doing some research I've found that it is called a Portuguese Roll, and it is pulchritudinous. This behemoth of a breakfast sandwich dazzled my tongue with its spice, filled my stomach amply with its bulky, chunky  proteins, and soothed me with its fresh, fundamental vegetables, all of it held together with that amazing roll of rolls that threatens to make Italian bread passe via its sublime texture alone. 'Tis the greatest sloppy joe to ever emerge from a steaming flattop. P.S. I found nothing 'shabby' or 'greasy' or 'dirty' or 'loud' about Peppi's. The service was friendly, the restaurant itself was clean, the atmosphere was quiet, and the sandwich was triumphant. If Primanti Brothers has a true parallel, it is Peppi's."
"3.0","Meh. I've had much better ramen elsewhere. Atmosphere is nice  and the service is good. Might be back because it is close to my house but not worth the effort if you aren't close by"
"4.0","The Roethlisberger sandwich should replace the Primanti sandwich as the sandwich to eat in Pittsburgh. And Big Ben should do something about it"
"2.0","I love the food and always have. I would like to give a five star rating but unfortunately i can't. I ordered a pizza and hogie at half time durning the Steelers game. It took almost two hours to be delivered. I don't live that far away. I get it that they want to watch the game . I have worked and still do have to work during Steelers games. But the customer comes first ! If that is not the case for them then they should not offer delivery service durning games. We were greatly disappointed. It was cold as well when delivered. I did call and was told it was out for delivery. Even after that it took another 30 minutes."
"5.0","For authentic Mexican, can not find a better spot! Tacos are the best hands down and the home made queso and chips.... just wow"
"5.0","What a great experience. The service was outstanding - Dexter knew the menu, was ready with great suggestions, and a lot of fun. We had excellent cocktails - corpse reviver for me - and a nice bottle of wine. The chicken liver and corned beef tongue (get over it - it's worth it) are awesome, as were the pastas and fish  if you're into pretentious service and people who take themselves too seriously, it's probably not your place. If you enjoy good food from good people who love what they do, you'll have a blast."
"4.0","City Works was much better than I expected. Went for happy hour on a Friday. Although it was packed there were still plenty of tables to sit. There are over 90 beers on tap, so a ton to choose from and they are $4 during happy hour. I found the food to be a bit pricey. I paid $15 for shrimp tacos. If they weren't so good I would complain more about the price.Our waitress was super friendly and quick. We did not all arrive at once so every time another person in our party came she came right over. There are parking garages all around. Next time I will park a bit closer. I was in a garage on the blvd of the allies. My other friends parked at Golds gym. I will be back."
"3.0","I enjoy the concept of this restaurant. The extensive grilled cheese menu is the obvious draw. Anything you can think of is made into a grilled cheese. They have multiple options for your sides of fries including garlic parm, old bay, and sweet potato. All their grilled cheeses come with a side of fries, and a little cup of tomato soup. We've had some of their appetizers and they were nothing to write home about. I've gone multiple weekend days where they do $15 bottomless mimosas. Although they clearly are not as strong or well made as standard mimosas, I enjoy being able to sit and chat with people for a few hours drinking mimosas and snacking for $15. They have a different special every week night as well but my favorite is every Monday they have all of their grilled cheeses half price. I have a hard time going any other time for grilled cheeses because it's such a good deal on Mondays!The atmosphere could be better. It's nothing too special on the inside and sometimes can be quite loud if you're sitting in the bar area. Also we have had some questionable servers. One was downright rude to us and ignored us. All in all, it's a cool place to experience as least once if you love options and grilled cheese sandwiches but don't expect anything amazing in terms of an overall experience."
"5.0","After speaking outside with the Owner/Chef, Matt, on Friday night while waiting to enter Club Cafe, we decided to return for dinner the following night. We ate a delicious Tapioca dish (not the pudding) that contained confit duck along with other delicious things and a Seitan Cheesesteake with hand-cut fries. Matt gave us vegetarian Arancini and these were delicious also. We went there because of the sincerity and passion of Matt and also the Yelp reviews. It was a delicious experience at the end of Carson Street, where the good stuff lives. We will return soon. A really good neighborhood place for adults on the South Side!"
"5.0","Fresh cooked authentic tacos right on the sidewalk, you can't get any better than this! I'm from Texas and my husband is Hispanic, so he can vouch for me when I say they are legit! Delicious!"
"1.0","I used to love this place but I came in today to get a juice and breakfast sandwich. Fresh juices are something the shop is known for. I noticed none in the cooler so I asked if they had any. They said they didn't today. When I asked why they said they 'can't get around to making it'. I find this hard to believe as there are 5 employees here who are chatting about sports and essentially messing around with each other. Very disappointed. Another Amp'd group failure. Will not be returning."
"5.0","Not enough stars to rate this place !!!! Great food, serve and atmosphere. I had the Protein 9 omelette and a Chia Tea Latte. Absolutely delicious. You have to check them out. You wont regret it"
"4.0","I went here to celebrate with my family, and this isn't a place that you'd go every weekend. The food is very different, but in an excellent way. It was very delicious, and the wine selection was vast. The waiter was always making sure that our food was up to par, and answered any question we had. The ambiance is very trendy and cozy, and the music playing was very good as well. I'll definitely be coming here again! Yum!"
"4.0","This pizza is great! And I'm really happy we have a place like this in south side now! But I like dipping my pizza in ranch and I was really disappointed in theirs. Its definitely just hidden valley squeezed into a container and sold for $.50 other than that the pizza is really good especially for the price I just wish they had their own 'bar-style' ranch"
"5.0","The plain exterior hides something amazing inside. The food is consistently delicious. I regularly crave their wonton soup! Their lunch special is a great deal! Their service is wonderful. They are friendly and take good care of you!"
"5.0","This food is spot on!!! Super fresh. I had the bacon egg and cheddar on a croissant. Everything's was perfectly cooked, the croissant was so fresh. I'll be back!!!"
"1.0","Got the cheesy breadsticks and the dough was raw when I bit into it. Normally I don't give yelp reviews but I've never gotten food so bad I couldn't eat it before."
"4.0","Stopped by here this morning for breakfast with some friends! We got there as soon as it opened but within the span of like an hour, the place was fully packed when we left. There was a line right out the door.I got the House smoked brisket hash and it was delicious and the portion was large. Potatoes were cooked perfectly and there was actually a lot of brisket, which was good! The general consensus with this establishment: large portions and delicious (also pretty!)Their pancakes are delicious... perfectly fluffy and dense but not too sweet; literally perfect. However, it's a little pricey. That's my only complaint! I think for my dish and my boyfriend's, it came out to $26. Pretty expensive for breakfast in my opinion, but I would come here again if I ever found myself in the strip."
"5.0","Delicious! Reminds me of my hometown, LA. Hands down the most authentic (and tasty) tacos in Pittsburgh.I liked these tacos so much I had them cater (yes, they do catering!!) a work event, and everyone went wild! They were very friendly, professional, clean and punctual. They also handled our tax exemption form nicely. All in all, it was a wonderful experience!"
"5.0","Delicious treat during your afternoon in the strip district! The picadillo tacos are awesome! The savory flavor of the beef with the fresh pico de gallo and cool sour cream is tasty! The cheese and squeeze of lime at the end cut through the richness of the meat and sour cream and add a lot of flavor! I also love the use of the corn tortilla instead of flour tortillas! Always one of our stops in the strip district, and will always be one of my favorite tacos in Pittsburgh!!"
"5.0","What a pleasant surprise! I did not expect such high quality food and wonderful atmosphere in the Northside. This place is definitely worth checking out. The service was amazing as were the dishes. We tried the baba ganoush and it was a great start. It was well balanced with pita and vegetables so although it's a good portion it's not too filling. I ordered the beef. They didn't have the beef cheeks from the menu and instead had short rib which was absolutely delightful. It was a bit fattier than I would like but the flavor was perfect. My husband had the duck and his only complaint is that he would have wanted a larger portion. Our friends also enjoyed the meal very much. We will definitely return."
"5.0","My husband was looking for a unique place to eat, and chose this. It was excellent! Several dishes we'd never heard of. My husband ordered the squid karaage as an appetizer. It was perfect-tasty and whetted our appetites for the rest of the meal.  I had the rabata and the gyoza. The rabata was cooked perfectly, both the meat and vegetables. My husband and son had ramen and really enjoyed it. My husband added a spicy sauce and said it was just right. The service was very good. Nice atmosphere, too. They have happy hour, with half priced appetizers and other good deals, every day, including Saturday. They are closed on Sunday. Next time we are in Pittsburgh, we'll come back."
"4.0","The yard was a really good experience. Went here with a few guys to break my fast with half off grilled cheese! Got the Daniel lafferty and it was delicious! The fries on the side were also really good and our waiter, John was really friendly and accommodating as we waited to finish up our fast. Will be there again"
"4.0","I mean, who can say no to $15 bottomless mimosas on a Sunday morning?  I know I can't!  I can't believe I had not been to this place until a couple of weekends ago when my brother came into town.  He asked where a good place to go for brunch, and I had heard pretty good things about this place.  Given that it's three blocks away from my place, I figured we could have as many mimosas as we wanted, and the wait staff did not disappoint.  Our glasses were seriously never empty.  Never. Ok, now away from the booze and onto the food.  I think the food was pretty good for the price (particularly in this part of Shadyside).  I had the French toast and my brother had the chicken and waffles, and he loved it.  I definitely need to stop in here again- and maybe for dinner sometime."
"5.0","Love love love this place!!!! The little cafe is perfect for a quick bite for breakfast or just a latte to go. I sat outside and ordered coffee, their homemade donuts, and salmon toast. It was a lot of food and reasonably priced. The salmon toast was my favorite thing. There were so many flavors and you can tell there was a lot of attention to detail while plating this dish. I can't wait to go back and try more!!!!"
"5.0","I live in an area that is a bit lacking in the ethnic restaurant department, so I was very excited to eat here while visiting. I wasn't disappointed. We started out with the fried cheese and the crepe as starters. Both were exceptional. I could have easily eaten 3 more of the crepes. For my entree, I had the chicken paprikas. Very nicely done. Lastly, we took dessert to go. All the desserts that were available were throughly explained to us. All were delicious, and tasted very European because they weren't super sweet. The service was very friendly and on point. I wish we had this restaurant in our area."
"5.0","This was a fun little Belgian restaurant. What was really nice was that we were able to get in and get seated immediately. The reviews of this place are definitely misleading here on yelp because I thought my burger was fantastic! I had the elk burger, which was a little pricey, but probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. It was juicy, tender, and the mix of rosemary and whatever special mustard they used was incredible! I definitely think the tater tot's did not deserve the exclamation points that they received on the menu because those should've been reserved for the elk burger! My advice, if you get The elk burger get something else other than the tots. My friend got the quinoa burger and thought it was good. Overall, this was an excellent burger joint!"
"3.0","Overpriced. Ribeye steak was just OK. Good service, although maître d' was not the most welcoming. VERY loud (guy in the) bar."
"5.0","I've never gotten anything else besides the chicken tikka masala but it's always perfect. Super large portions for a cheap price and also happens to be super tasty, what more can you ask for? The workers are always super friendly, wait can be a little long depending on when you go, but it's definitely worth it."
"4.0","I am a big fan of this restaurant. Definite hole in the wall family run operation. The service is great and the food is fresh and consistent. The portions are large - they don't skimp on meat and the prices are reasonable/cheap.Of the appetizers I recommend siamese kisses, thai samosas, and satay chicken. Ive tried a few different curries (red, green, panang) and some noodle dishes. Nothing disappoints!! I always have left overs for lunch the next day.The girls that run this place really know what they are doing. I am eating a take out order right now and wrote this review solely due to the surprise homemade brownie they gave me with my chicken red curry. My meal is delicious, even though I ordered a 6 and my mouth is burning - fire or not, this dish has tons of flavor. The brownie is gooey and delicious too!"
"3.0","I went here for lunch and ordered a sushi combo. They have a combination of chinese dishes and a sushi menu but I haven't tried their chinese yet.  The sushi was decent and reasonably priced, but the quality of the fish wasn't that great with some of the tougher portions of the fish included in the cut, though it was adequate/edible.  Service really fast to get you seated and get your food, but minimal attention after that.  It gets crowded and tables are really close together.  They also get picky about where you sit and won't let 2 people sit at a 4 person table, etc."
"5.0","Best! Bubble! Tea! And the sweet and spicy chicken was amazing! I'd never had korean fried chicken before, but I have had a lot of other Korean food. The flavor reminded me of that, and is nostalgic for me this way. The music goes between what you can hear on the radio station and some kpop. Its a very cute little place with quick service and a good feeling."
"4.0","Pretty decent spot. Service is nice and options aren't bad. Being in Station Square it's a little out of the way of other nightlife. So you'll have drive or Uber/Lyft if you have night plans. Still worth a try!"
"5.0","Food was excellent. We had samosa Chat then Shrimp tikka masala and vegetable  jalfrezi masala .We chose 5 out of 10 for our spice level, and it was perfect , though I did notice others around asking for only 2 or 3.  I guess we are seasoned Indian food tasters, being from the U.K. Highly recommend going here for fresh tasty food. The wait staff was very friendly, just wish they served an ice cold beer, had to make do with a diet Soda. Very reasonably priced too,"
"4.0","Morcilla is, perhaps unsurprisingly given the quality of the food at Cure, definitely the best tapas restaurant in Pittsburgh. It has a very authentic atmosphere and reminds me of bars/restaurants in Spain, from the hanging hams to the bar-top display of tapas.As this is a tapas restaurant, the menu is dominated by snacks (Pintxos, Montaditos, and Croquetas). Every snack I have tried here, across multiple visits, has been absolutely delicious. My favorites are the oxtail and jamon. Some reviewers have complained about being surprised by the price-to-quantity ratio of these snacks. I encourage you to look at the tapas that are on display on the bar as you enter the restaurant... this will give you a sense of the quantity of food you are getting, and you can decide which ones are worth it to you. They may not be huge, but the snacks I have tried are rich and delicious and worth it.Then there are small plates to share. I haven't tried any of these yet, but they look great!  Finally, there are big platters that are meant to be shared (and commonly are combined with snacks and small plates). I tried the ribs platter on my first visit here. They were good, but not mind-blowing. I think we expected something a little more unique from a place like this, considering how inventive and amazing our experiences at Cure had been in the past.In the one full dinner I've had here, we had churros for dessert. The sauce is delicious and the flavor of the churros was fine, but they were so thin!  I was expecting more substantive ones, based on my most recent experiences in Barcelona.  Not sure I would order this for dessert again.Although the restaurant is usually pretty busy and advance reservations are necessary on many nights, the bar is first-come, first-serve and often has space. You can order any of the snacks to enjoy at the bar. I love that you can stop in on a whim and order a drink and a snack or two. It is such a luxury to have this new joint right down the block!"

"5.0","The Kona Crust steak is the best! I always love to come celebrate special occasions here. The service is always so great and accommodating here. Thank you for all the wonderful experiences I've had."
"5.0","Simply put, this is the best food that Downtown Pittsburgh has to offer. Go. Get. Now."
"3.0","Not bad, not good. We arrived and got seated quickly, the waiter came around as soon as we sat down to get our drinks. He was very friendly and refilled our drinks as soon as we finished them. We ordered as soon as we were ready. The environment was nice and fun. Although, it took a while for the food to come. The food was nothing special. I got the Buffalo Dip and the chicken chunks were so large, I dont know how they expect me to eat it with a chip. I would not come back personally, but the people were really nice!"
"5.0","Ooooo besides the five stars for the delicious scents of baking treats alone everything tasted fantastic! We loved the variety of items and the reasonable prices. I'm not sure what else I can say that hasn't been mentioned already but we will be back! Also no pictures cause I wasn't waiting to put down those carbs lol."
"5.0","Love thier Korean Fried Chicken. I love the sweet and spicy sauce. Really really tasty! Thier bubble tea also taste good with a variety of toppings.My to-go place for quick n good snacks!"
"5.0","Whatever you do, please do yourself a favor and order the Sadako Chicken. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the sauteed veggies had a nice amount of crunch that provided a lovely contrast.  It's definitely on the spicy end of the spectrum, but the heat was offset nicely by fresh cilantro, sliced tomatoes, and lemon wedges. Light, flavorful, and fresh. One of the best dishes I've had in quite some time. Also enjoyed the vegetable momos. Pillowy pockets of dough stuffed with a potato filling that reminded me of an Indian samosa that was steamed instead of fried.  Very tasty.Entree wise, we went with an order of Nepali Chicken and Nepali Lamb.  Both were excellent. The lamb was a bit too well done for my tastes but still had a great flavor. Both dishes were presented in a way that lent itself to a choose-your-own adventure dining experience. You get a plate of rice and several little side dishes that contain a variety of delicious vegetables, lentils, chutneys, sauces, and pickled goodies. So you're only limited by the depths of your own imagination. Subba is quite unassuming when you walk by, but please don't let that scare you away. Once you walk up the steps, you'll be greeted by a wall of amazing smells and friendly people.  Restaurant was clean, prices were fair, and the food was truly top notch.  Can't wait to go back again!"
"4.0","I was in Pittsburgh for the day and I met up with an old friend who was going to take me to the South Side. We ended up at Marios.Its a pretty cool looking place with a lot of room to hang out, drink and watch the game. The staff is friendly and they work hard and there are enough tv's to catch all the highlights.They offer beer in numerous sizes which is a cool touch. The bar also has a decent array of brews for you to sample.They off a large 64 ounce boot filled to the top with your favorite brew. I obviously had to try this and went with a very large serving of Yuengling!"
"4.0","Six packs and hot dogs. They go together in Pittsburgh like coffee and donuts. And this place does it right. After a walk up to Mt Washington, you need an unpretentious (not dive bar) place to unwind over some beers and eat some hot dogs. With their wide selection of both, this place fits the bill every time. Their prices are reasonable and the same for take-out as when you lounge on their couches and drink them inside. So if you take the incline up, venture a little off the main drag and find this gem."
"1.0","The food was terrible. I would rather have eaten a McDonald's burger and fries. The fries, which are an up charge, tasted like they were store Ore-Ida brand and had not even been fully baked in an oven or possibly just microwaved. Also ordered a medium burger and it came out well done with burnt bacon. Overall terrible over priced food experience. I would recommend never eating here. I didn't get a drink but the bar looked okay."
"4.0","I disagree with Darren. The buffalo chicken pizza was pretty good as was my macaroni salad and the Oreo cheesecake. The only thing was that it took 90 minutes to get to us. Other than that, they're a solid delivery option with a wide range."
"4.0","I had purchased bagels and donuts for my new daylight 'colleagues,' but I didn't want to omit my former evening shift comrades, so 3 large pizzas acted as my going-away gift to them. A half an hour later, I inquired about the pies.'Hey Darren, man, thanks for the pizza. That shit was good.''You're welcome. Is there any left?''Uhhhh. I dunno. Lemme get back to you, ok?'And with that, my co-worker split like James Brown at the Apollo.I jogged to the dumpster outside the dock.3 empty pizza boxes were laying inside.30 cuts of pizza were obliterated within 30 minutes. In the hot summer sun, I got...chills for my co-workers are indeed...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjRXfHWtvW4"
"5.0","Amazing food!! We go here often and have never been disappointed with a dish. They change up the menu depending on the season.  The Brussels sprouts app is very tasty. We always order this. By far, my favorite meal here is the diner burger.  It is the best burger I have ever had!"
"3.0","Pamela's is a classic brunch staple in Pittsburgh. I have many memories here from my college days, and it always brings back great memories when I dine here. After traveling around a bit and living in NYC, I admit I have been spoiled. In college, Pamela's was the best brunch thing to me, but now I've gotten pickier. The hot cakes are great as everyone had mentioned. It's a cross between a pancake and a crepe, but leans more towards the latter. I got the Banana Walnut Hotcake, and it definitely hit the spot. I also tried the Tex Mex Omelette, which was tasty as well. It had a little bit of heat, and the side potatoes were good too.Overall, a solid, safe bet for brunch. Be sure to get there early, as the dining room fills up quickly. Cash only (PNC ATM is across the street). They also grossly underestimate the wait times when I went on busy Sunday mornings."
"3.0","Meh. Overall taste is good but definitely pricy. 3 stars for the fact they source local, ingredients are fresh and taste is overall good. I would never pay the full $10 for one of their mini burgers. It's literally the size of 1 White Castle burger. Specialty nights would definitely help this place a little."
"4.0","I haven't eaten here yet, so I'm solely reviewing the bar.  I always have a great time when I pop in.  Jeff and Lindsey behind the bar are super fun and friendly.  Drink prices are decent and I love the karaoke every other Sunday.  I'll add more once I eat here!"
"4.0","Great, simple bar downtown if you're looking to grab a quick beer and a sandwich after work. Sometimes an overly trendy and over priced bar is just NOT what I'm in the mood for. Sammy's is perfect for those times. The price is right and I love the casual atmosphere to have a few beers and hang out. They have some great beers on tap as well as a good selection of domestic cans and bottles.According to a lot of my friends, the best tasting and priced Bloody Marys around! (I don't like Bloody Marys, but I trust the judgement of my pals when it comes to cocktails!) You can get many different kinds of sandwiches, although they seem to be known for their corned beef or pastrami. The brisket is really good as well! Sides include macaroni salad, potato salad and cole slaw-- all of which I have eaten and enjoyed.Bartenders are friendly and it's surely one of the best deals for a meal and some drinks downtown!"
"5.0","went there for lunch and i had the skirt steak hoagie that came with soup and coleslaw for under 6 bucks. my wife got the fried haddock sandwich which was enough for 3.  food was 5 star. peppersteak soup was very good  and there is plenty oof parking across the st in a city lot. attached bar too that we didnt go to. try it out, its worth it"
"4.0","Umami is a place that offers so much! My only complaint is the price but it's fair given what they provide you: quality, atmosphere and experience.The restaurant is kinda hidden (and exciting in this way). You have to keep an eye out for this gem. Once you find the door you have to go up a few stairs (which isn't so great if you're handicapped or older), and you'll be warmly welcomed by a host.The atmosphere is amazing. I was so amazed at the beauty and sleek design of the interior. I felt fancy! I almost felt like I was in Japan.My friends and I shared a lot of dishes family style. The most memorable food item I ate was the matcha sponge cake. Last time I checked, it was no longer available (so sad) but the other options are sure to impress you!This is definitely a treat-yourself kind of place! And more so a place for those 21+! Will most certainly come again!"
"5.0","This is an absolute hidden gem. Really fresh, authentic and delicious japanese food. So glad I was able to visit this place in Pittsburgh. Good sashimi with a variety of fish types. Recommend the Sashimi Lover Deluxe for 2. Even the cuts were perfect thickness and the rice was delicious. I appreciate the noodles and the fried veggie tempura. Its a nice crisp taste even though its fried. The ambiance is perfect and they could seat a variety of party sizes. I recommend making a reservation for larger parties on the weekends.I love everything about this place! So excited to go back."
"1.0","Ordered delivery, never came. Called restaurant and the man told me I had ordered it for pick up. I didn't but ok I asked him to send it please. Three hours later I called back and he told me first that it had been picked up in store. Wrong. Told me a completely different order twice before finding my order from 4 hours earlier and insisted for the second time it would take a half hour. Don't order from here unless you want to argue with a man who keeps calling you 'honey'."
"1.0","Unbelievable! It took so long to wait for the food. Food is also very overpriced, even more expensive than Japanese restaurants in NYC. Flavor is not as good as expected. I will never come back again. Not trying to be mean, just honest opnion."
"1.0","We've been loyal patrons of coca cafe since it opened, however it's unlikely that we will ever return. The only food that should be served on an ice cold plate is salad. Definitely nothing hot-breakfast related. No microwave? No heat lamps? No problem! There's this marvelous modern warming device called an oven, and if you place your serving plates in it, they'll be toasty warm and help keep the, what should be, warm breakfast food your customers expect to be served, warm from kitchen to table, no matter what the kitchen temperature. Upon expecting a warm breakfast only to have it served on ice cold plates, I promptly requested my just-served ice cold over-medium eggs be immediately returned to the kitchen for some type of warming, only to get the wtf eyeroll from the waitress - yeah, I did see that. And I rarely, if ever send my food back. You all need some training on people skills!The owner came out with a half-hearted apology about 'the kitchen fans make the kitchen air 50 degrees, which severely chills the plates...' um, not an acceptable explanation or excuse or apology, frankly. It seemed more of an obligatory 'apology;' one filled with contempt for the customer who was making a REASONABLE request for breakfast food to be warm. Moses, lady; I don't care that you've been in business for 12 years. If that is supposed to be some kind of testament to how good your restaurant is?...think again!Lousy food, combined with mediocre customer skills and service will close your doors faster than you can utter the word 'boo!'Oh, yeah...did I mention that there were 3 other patrons in the restaurant and it took nearly 45 minutes to get our food...our ice cold, should-have-been-warm breakfast food!This was a Thursday, not a Sunday, as many reviews note the Sunday brunch debacle. With only 3 other patrons in the restaurant, it should not take 45 minutes to get a breakfast!Not a 'coffee or toast on the house for our indifference to your ice-cold breakfast food, maam.' Nothing but a contemptful 'apology.'Oy. What once was a good place to eat is now a shadow of what it once was. Go to Ritter's instead - less expensive and nicer people.A HUGE disappointment."
"4.0","My parents never been to the strip and decided to take them and do some lunch here. The service was really good. My parents really enjoyed how nice our waiter kevin was. The food was incredible. I will have to say the sushi was not that good. The Philadelphia roll, the salmon was dry. The spider roll the meat in the roll was dry too. However, my parents had the crab cake sandwhich and sockeye salmon and those made up for my sushi. Also the lobster bisque is some of the best i ever had."
"4.0","This little cafe is perfect for a quick brunch! We ordered the berries toast with vanilla cream, the apple & brie crepe, a caprese bagel sandwich and chai lattes. I would not order the french toast again, just because it was a little too sweet for me. The chai lattes were served in a little mason jars, and they were good but could have been hotter. Everything else was delicious, especially the bagel sandwich. The staff was very kind and the food came out quickly. I will definitely go back to try more food from their extensive menu!"
"1.0","Service is terrible. Only one person works the kitchen and the wait is very long. If I could give zero stars I would. Drinks are all lukewarm, even the iced water. Food takes forever to come out. Kind of a shame how bad the service is, considering that the food is actually pretty good, and that there's a wide selection on the menu. Ordered the donut holes, ended up being cake/brownie balls? One had a hair in it. Orange juice took 30 min to be served. Server also charged for bacon that was never brought out. Not worth it."
"5.0","Lovely little coffee shop :) It's cozy and you can get delicious coffee and simple eats. It's great!"
"3.0","Hello Bistro is my go-to downtown lunch spot. I love the make-your-own salad - it's fresh, lite, delicious, and different every time. The staff is courteous - even during the relentless lunch rush.  Slow service is an issue. Today it took 20 minutes to make, chop, and serve my salad. Hello Bistro has a great concept, fresh food, and a very interested lunchtime audience. I'd like to see them up their game on execution. Tip: be sure to order at the register before joining the salad line."
"2.0","I stopped for some Halal food and decided to go with lamb curry over rice. In addition I was asked to choose a vegetable dish. I picked the spinach dish. Do not know the exact name.Lamb is my favorite meat, however, this place was able to cook it with no flavor in it. Honestly, I did not feel that I was eating lamb. However they cook it, it does not make any sense. It has some spices in it, but could not decide what they are. The hot spice is just hot, without adding any good flavor.The rice was plain and bland, not impressive at all.The spinach was obviously made from frozen spinach. Therefore you get no flavor of true spinach. For $9, they filled the box with rice and put about 5-6 pcs of 1-inch lamb cubes. The amount was more than enough for a person, but without any taste, it can feed at least 3 people.This place is lucky for not having a competition around them offering same type of food.I also checked their market and felt sorry for whoever shops there. Their prices are unfortunately flying. These people do not deserve to sell halal. But, they will continue to this until their customers teach them they are not treated in a halal way. They can easily sell for cheaper, but they won't. Casue money is good and delicious for the. That is why they will not care about the taste of food as long as customer continue to appreciate this type of poor quality."
"1.0","Had a business lunch there this week, lingered a little after the meal to talk, never been so hustled by a waiter to pay & get out as I had at Las Velas.  Super aggressive waiter came to table 4-5x, loudly broke up an important conversation several times, repositioned the check in the center of table to basically tell us to get out, incredibly rude and inappropriate way to treat customers, avoid this place."
"5.0","We went here for cocktails and a bite to eat before a concert at the Rex. We sat at the bar, so we did not have a server. We ordered the huarache, poutine, pork spring roll, arancini, and the pan con chicharron. I did find that some of the menu items were a little hard to decipher (sandwich vs. no sandwich, small vs. larger plate, etc.), but we ended up ordering more than enough for the three of us. All of the food was delicious and it arrived promptly. The real standout for me was the cocktails. I left totally raving about our drinks and raved about them to everyone in the concert. Alec was an incredible bartender and he made drinks with great flavors and balance. When I heard this place has only been open for a couple of months, I was totally shocked. We will definitely be back!"
"5.0","Great food, excellent service. George was great. Recommend the pulled pork sandwich it's a side of Mac & cheese."
"5.0","Amazing experience. Great food. Not the biggest selection, but it's all about quality."
"4.0","This place is small and cozy. We came here on a Sunday night and the restaurant was not busy. Our waitress was friendly and not pushy since we took a while trying to navigate the extensive menu options! I ordered the tortellini. The dish was rich with the ricotta cheese and the creamy sauce. I finished only about half the dish. The flavors were good but it got to be too much after a while. The portion was also huge which may also have to do with my ability to finish it. We also ordered the veal parm with pasta. The veal was cooked nicely. The meal came with 2 pieces of veal and a nice portion of pasta with marinara sauce. I liked it better than the tortellini. That dish didn't have anything left at the end of the meal! For dessert we ordered the ice cream with candied nuts and the tiramisu. Both very good! The tiramisu was not too sweet and a nice portion to end the meal."
"4.0","I was so excited to try this place after hearing the chicken is as good as Nashvilles! The place is definitely promising. The chicken is made really fresh and very juicy but crispy at the same time. I would recommend the tenders or the sandwich. They add a tangy sauce with pickled veggies in the sandwich that really balance out the flavor. I would say the medium is a good spicy level for those that love spicy but dont want to go too overboard. But I did hear that the spicy is really good too! I would say the only disappointment was the fries. They werent flavored well and kind of stale. Hopefully it was just a bad batch... anyways I will be back and would say its a good local place for some delicious fried chicken. And that sweet tea reminds me of the south FOR SURE!! Recommend!"
"5.0","Every bite at this relaxed open plan restaurant was delicious. Lamar, the server, was energetic and friendly, and there was no drama getting me seated. I had the Polish Hill burger- which has a fried pierogi on top. The burger tasted like a homemade beef patty, the pierogi was fresh and chewy in just the right way, and the fries were superb (and salty). Really just a delicious meal."
"4.0","Late night pizza is a staple of the South Oakland nightlife culture. Offering a $6 dollar pie in just minutes, Antoon's pizza is Pitt's superior late night za. What the business lacks in seating, it more than makes up for in the quality of it's pizza. I won't go to say that Antoon's is the best available pizza in Oakland, but it's the greatest bang for you buck.Antoon's pies feature a doughy crust and a smooth, lightly spiced sauce. The medium thin crust is very well balanced with the proportion of sauce added to the pie. The cheese mixture is done well, and does not puddle with grease like the joint's next door pizza competition.Obviously, some people prefer the ability to sit down in a restaurant to eat their pizza after a night on the town, but if you're a true pizza connoisseur, the quality of pie at Antoon's will win you over each time.Note: The four star rating I gave to this restaurant does not match with my direct review of the actual food, but for the quality of experience for the price you pay!"
"4.0","Sandwiches are actually a little too complicated for my simple tastes, but still good. Chips are okay. Mac & cheese is good. Prices are pretty fair. Good service and cool interior. Open late, which is nice since it's kinda hard to find food late at night in Shadyside."
"4.0","Awesome Roethlisburger.  Lives up to the hype. May have to get another one before I leave town."
"5.0","Good highly recommended. I visited in a cold night but the restaurant was packed lol it must be good and it turned out to be awesome. I don't really like the spring rolls but the pho soup is awesome"
"3.0","The pizza itself was very good.  Cheesy and greasy and it surely hit the spot when I needed to satisfy my hunger.But, there is always a but, they need to update their menu on here.  The prices are way off.  From what we ordered according to the menu listed here on Yelp, and what we paid when the food showed up, was really quite a bit difference.  Asides from that, I couldn't see much else to fault here.  Or maybe that was because they made a mistake in my favor and in order to rectify that they gave me a free small pizza."
"4.0","Fantastic outdoor seating area along the bike trail on Washington's Landing. Food is good but not great."
"5.0","This is my favorite Happy Hour spot in all of Pittsburgh, and I have been to many. I have become a regular. I know all of the bartenders and staff. During happy hour, most mixed drinks, and beers are all half off. They also have $5 appetizers which are great too. I usually get the chicken nachos which is so big I usually need help finishing them. The bartenders are polite and can make you pretty much anything that you are feeling in the mood for. On Fridays, they have a gentleman that plays cover rock music. It sometimes gets a bit loud, but he is pretty good and plays requests. If I drank and ate the same amount most places, my bill would be double the amount. They pour strong drinks(most places in Pittsburgh does though. They have a variety of draft beers and bottles. Monday is wing night with $.40 wings which are great, I usually just go with the hot buffalo. You can't go wrong with these. I wouldn't bring kids here, but is good for every one else. Juke box is playing most of the time. I go here all the time and will continue to go here. It gets very busy during nights on the weekend, so I tend to stay away during that time. They definitely run a good, profitable business here. It is a sports bar, so they have many TV's to watch games on."
"4.0","Great little cafe.  Visiting Pittsburgh from out of town, and this popped up as a spot to grab a quick breakfast on our way to our next destination.  Easy to find parking out front, which was surprising for a Saturday at 9am.  I got a Pork Roll/Cheese/Egg sandwich on a bagel with a coffee.  Great price point, simple but delicious sandwich.  Most tables are 2-seaters with only one booth that could seat the three of us (though there were extra stools and chairs out that you could pull over).  I would certainly make it a point to come here on the regular if I was a local, and you can tell the folks that work there know their regulars.  The other patrons were all relaxed and joked with the staff.  Overall, happy we stopped here!"
"5.0","You know that Foreigner song? 'It Feels Like the First Time'... These burgers make me feel like it's the first magical time I bit into a burger.I'm almost nervous to go back. I just feel like at some point it will disappoint me. Yet I keep being proved wrong. It's amazing. Every time. Every. Single. Time. It blows me away. The best burger I've ever had... unequivocally & absolutely mind blowing.I highly recommend the Morningside Burger, with a fried egg & bacon. If everyone got to experience a burger like this, there would be no war."
"5.0","Stopped before coming to a show at heinz hall. We ordered the inside out grilled cheese. It was awesome! I'm usually weary about ordering grilled cheese anywhere since you can make so cheap at home but the waiter suggested it. Stuffed with cheese, bacon, tomato, then burnt cheese wrapped around the bread. It was large portion and could only eat half. Definitely a must order. Leftovers were just as good. Waiter was friendly and helpful"
"3.0","This is our first time to eat at this restaurant. We were seated promptly to our table. We waited less than 5 min for our server to greet us.  After our order was placed we waited around 20 minutes for the food to come.  I ordered a cheeseburger but when the burger arrived there was no cheese. Should I say something. No I did not. The burger was very dry and not much flavor.    Looking around the chairs were all knicked and the carpeting good use a good cleaning.     Would I return?  Probably not. Jerome put some money in this place."
"4.0","I have to start out by saying I am not a meat eater so that's perhaps if I was, I'd have liked it better. Semi-fancy atmosphere but I still think a nice pair of jeans with a nice shirt or sweater is appropriate. We had reservations for 630 and arrived on time, however, we still waited 20 min to be seated. Our server was very nice was service was a little slow. They seemed very busy and perhaps a little disorganized getting us waters, bread and salad but this was minor. It was nice that they split the wedge salad for us in the kitchen since we were sharing it with 3 people. There was no shortage of delicious blue cheese crumbles! I'd skip the bacon next time but it wasn't hard to take off either. My scallops were cooked to perfection and came with a delicious pesto. Garlic whipped mashed potatoes were also flavorful and delicious. The biggest disappointment was the brussel sprouts. They were quite honestly, terrible! They were still hard, pieces cut way too big and just completely lacked any flavor. I've made better at home which is sad because they aren't difficult to make. They were clearly an afterthought so I'd get a different size. Hopefully some of the other vegetables are better. My husband LOVED his NY Strip steak and said it melted like butter! Overall, good meal with good atmosphere. Pricey and expected for a steak house. Great location down in PPG place by market square. Would return but best to bring your meat lovers I think!"
"5.0","I work a block away from Salem's, and I eat there twice a week.  Don't be fooled by the cheap, cafeteria style seating - everything at Salem's is incredible, whether you want a burger and fries, or more traditional Indian/Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food.  They have a large menu (posted above the counter) to order from, as well as about 20 feet of hot food waiting to be dished up from the counter.  Vegetarians have options such as vegetable curry, spinach, chickpeas, and hummus, but if you're like me, you want some meat!  Go ahead and try a lamb gyro, beef gyro, or some chili chicken.  They also have a great beverage selection, if you're into specialty sodas, juices, milks, or Snapple.Salem's isn't the classiest joint in the strip, but like I said, I'll take it multiple times a week!  The prices are great when you consider how large the serving sizes are, but healthy eaters can get smaller dishes as well."
"5.0","LOVE Thai Gourmet. I've lived in Bloomfield for 3 years and have never even tried Thai Cuisine because I would never stray from my beloved Thai Gourmet. Their prices are great, and each entree can be stretched into two or even three meals. When you order to-go, they sometimes throw in a surprise little treat which is always delicious. The service is great in the restaurant. Very quick and your water glass will never even get close to empty. The decor inside is a little eclectic, but that's part of the charm. The only word of caution I would provide is that the spice level can be a little inconsistent sometimes...unless last just my tolerance. Err on the side of caution and you'll be fine."
"1.0","Had high hopes, but majorly let down. Maybe bc it was restaurant week. Maybe bc it was a Tuesday night. Maybe bc ppl like Tom Brady continue to dominate the NFL when you really just wish he'd jump off a cliff. I had the salmon with crab in a ginger soy glaze. Salmon was overcooked yet the skin was flabby. Had lobster bisque to start, which justifies one star. An hour and fifteen minutes later I got my overcooked salmon and 2nd drink. The glaze was pretty sweet and definitely cancelled out the crab since it got lost in the glaze. Dessert was included in the restaurant week menu but we finally asked for it to go after a 2+ hour experience. We had reservations and the hostess mentioned that they had stopped accepting walk-ins that night bc of the amount of reservations they had. Not sure why they seemed surprised by the size of the crowd - and to me, it seemed normal. Service was subpar at best. Ah well. Disappointed but I'll live."
"4.0","Good simple bar. Decent food, service was fine. Nothing to knock your socks off but an enjoyable experience and I would definitely go back."
"4.0","General tso white meat is delicious. Their sauce is great.  Fast service and reliably good. Their egg rolls are my absolute favorite. I usually skip the egg roll and get soup, but not here. Shrimp egg roll rocks just don't eat it immediately and burn the roof of your mouth."
"5.0","This is my FAVORITE brunch place in Pittsburgh. I mean they have a great offering of amazing options and the prices are nice. I always get the brunch o bro and instead of bacon I get short rib which is dynamite. I recommend trying it out. The bottomless mimosas is also a great sell and the Bloody Mary bar is always loaded with great options."
"1.0","Ordered Spinach Pie and Kafta Sandwich 'lebanese style'. Never had food that insulted my palette as much as this place in recent memory. The spinach pie had rock hard pieces throughout. When pointing it out to the server he snarkly replied 'uhhhh ohhhhhkay'. The Kafta never saw any sort of seasoning or the hummus the 'lebanese style' had stated. What a disaster. Service was horrible. 4 minutes to receive a coke at a place that was more or less empty. No apology for the crappy spinach pie. Save your time and money. Plenty of other restaurants in Pittsburgh that will appreciate your business and deliver on basic customer service. This place fell way short."
"4.0","Something told me to be adventuresome when my first choice for lunch was closed for the day.  I was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled upon here.  I saw Pamela's and thought oh well, if I can have breakfast for dinner, why not try breakfast for lunch.  When I walked in I saw the sign for the upstairs eatery and it piqued my interest.  I can honestly say I have no clue as to what Peruvian food is and even though I partook in this delicious place I still have no concept into the food except that it tastes amazing.  We were seated almost immediately with menus in hand.  For lunch this place was not busy in the least.  Too bad for everyone else, because this is a great place to have lunch.  I skimmed the menu but the specials board is what really caught my attention.  I cannot remember the name of what I ate, but who cares, because it tasted so good that almost right after I finished my plate, short of licking it clean, I wanted more of the special!  The special was chicken atop cheese curd and then topped itself with pesto.  What an ideal combination of flavors.  The special also came with rice I believe and the house salad.  The salad was mixed greens with a combination of olives, walnuts and carrots.  The dressing was the house dressing and not too heavy or tangy.Our server seemed a little inexperienced, but I won't hold that against her.  I am going to assume that she didn't know much about Peruvian food either.  Even though she really couldn't answer a lot of our questions about the food, she was swift and made sure we were taken care of.  They also have shelves of Peruvian items that you can purchase if you are so inclined to do so.  I did not while I was here, but it does give you something interesting to look at and start a conversation about during your meal."
"1.0","I have tried to give this place a chance, but today was my last visit. The servers were not attentive about anything, when we would say 'excuse me' we were ignored. After we placed our order, we did not get our food for 45 minutes and it was delivered from the kitchen. The wait staff did not check on us and barely acknowledged us. My water glass was empty over half of the time and my friend could not drink water because there was something in her glass. When we finally were asked about our checks (once we put our cards on the table) there was an error with our receipts. We spoke to someone about this (perhaps manager?) and she would not let us finish our sentence and kept covering up the receipt and would say 'all that matters is the card numbers are right' but our names were wrong and they charged the wrong cards. They were very unhelpful and refused to listen to the costumer (even interrupted us) several times. I have enjoyed the food, but there are so many places in Pittsburgh with similar food that also staff people who are kind and attentive. We never received an apology for anything throughout our entire 1 1/2 hour experience and we will not be visiting again."
"5.0","Good service and great food. The taste is close to ​authentic Asian food, which is my favorite. I also got my dishes quickly. Overall, if I have a chance to pass by the city again, I will visit this restaurant."
"4.0","Really good steaks! The porter house is to die for! Something about cooking a steak in butter! Paula Deen would be proud! The location could be better. With all the new construction of new condos and office buildings going up now would be a great time to move! Was my favorite until Hyde Park came to town. Really good service and drinks!"
"3.0","I have to say I wasn't really impressed by this place.  Is it cool?  Yeah, of course.  Anytime you have a rooftop beer garden in downtown it's quite awesome.  The view is amazing, but that cannot make up for the lack of customer care.It's a bit confusing to reach here.  You need to take a forever slow elevator to reach the rooftop.  Then when you get out you have to show your ID up top.  How about you have a person downstairs at the elevator entrance to bypass this.  That way you can make a swift entrance upstairs.Getting up top, it's nice looking and huge.  But everyone seems to want to be up here.  Lots of people everywhere attempting to stake their claim at a table.  Makes for a hard time to move about.Service, spotty at best.  For me I found that going to the bar myself to get my drink was faster than waiting for a server to get it to me.  I watched as my friends placed orders with their server.  While this happened, I went over to the bar and got my drink and returned to the table way before my friends' drinks arrived at the table.If I wanted sub par service I would have went to any other bar in the city."
"5.0","Abrigada!!! We loved this cafe! The bifana sandwich was delicious - spicy & juicy on a crusty Portuguese bun! The nata tart reminded us of the tarts in Belen (near Lisbon). It was so good that we placed a to go order after we ate to take home to my Portuguese Italian Mother. The staff were all so friendly & helpful! I had never been to this neighborhood, but now I want to return for the Azorean Cafe & to check out the other shops.  I highly recommend a visit!!!"
"5.0","This place is on the top of my list for the best Thai in the city. Always so consistent, very generous portions, family owned and operated, and to top it off it's VERY vegan friendly. They have a separate fryer for all their vegetables, which is pretty uncommon. The General Tso's Tofu is the best I have ever had, I can't go here without ordering it! Spring rolls are so fresh, and crab ragoons are a staple order for my boyfriend. Recently had the chili paste stir fry and the veggies were SO fresh and of quality. Not mushy or anything. They stand up and are crisp and flavorful. I seriously dream about General Tso's tofu and have to satisfy the craving every so often. Nothing comes close to their dish! They also have awesome lunch specials and now offer delivery. Prices are very affordable, especially for the portion sizes and quality of food. Love supporting this restaurant whenever I can. They are also BYOB, added bonus!"
"1.0","If I could give this place no stars, I would. My boyfriend and I made a reservation at this place a week in advance after several recommendations from or friends. We arrived early to our time and were seated promptly by the owner, who acted as the host. Unfortunately, our table for two was buried between the wall and three other larger-party tables. At first, it didn't seem too bad, comical even, to have other people shift around to let us shimmy into our seats. However, as the night wore on, our patience grew thinner as even the waiter could not walk over to our table. The staff had to pass dishes through the other table of 8 to ours. My boyfriend had to stand and walk over to the blocked space between two tables where the waiter met him and took our order. I did not speak a single word to the waiter the whole evening. The food itself was decent. We ordered the bruschetta and the spinach and ricotta ravioli. The ravioli came with what appeared to be tomato soup, nothing too extraordinary. I was too turned off by the poor seating arrangement and lack of care to appreciate the dishes for what they were. At the end of our meal, after the large party had left, we asked the waiter to speak to the manager. The host from the front came over and we began to voice our complaints. Before I could even finish my first sentence about the horrible service, Mr. Gerasole interrupted me to brag about his restaurant having operated for 17 years. He went on, saying that his face on the waiter's shirts, he wasn't going to 'win' with us, and how we shouldn't  have any complaints with the food. When we tried to speak up again, he stopped us again, shaking his head condescendingly and sighing exasperatedly. My boyfriend, who doesn't usually voice his concerns, began to argue with him, begging him to please listen to and understand our concerns. All we got in response was his laughter. I told him this was no laughing matter and he got upset and forceful with his words. He told me that if I had had a problem with the table, I should've said something in the beginning rather than waiting the entire meal to speak up. I had placed a reservation a week in advance, showed up early to my allotted time, was hungry and did not want to wait for another table. What would even be the point in making a reservation? When we asked whether he was blaming us for the poor service, he denied vehemently. Then, he asked us what he could do and I said you could pick up our check. He responded with laughter again, saying that it would be useless since it would do nothing for his establishment. I lost all respect for this man at this point. He offered to buy us a drink or a dessert when we no longer had the appetite nor wanted to spend another minute sitting there in his restaurant.The absolute worst cherry on top of the whole damned experience was his racist commentary at the end of the night. As we were waiting for the gift certificate he so graciously offered after refusing to cover our check, he started smiling and saying that Indians were good negotiators. This was obviously directed at my boyfriend, who didn't react. I spoke up, saying that I disagreed and did not feel his comment was appropriate. Immediately, Mr. Gerasole rolled his eyes, let out a huge sigh, and said 'here we go again'. He then bent over and said to me 'This is going to be tough, but I bet you I can guess your nationality'. I couldn't take it anymore. My boyfriend stopped him there and as soon as we got the certificate, we walked out. Mr. Gerasole, a word of advice. Listen to your customers, treat them with respect, and show some humility. Not only did you ruin my date night, but you also imparted an unnecessary burden on that unfortunate middle table as well. I hope no other customer has to tolerate the treatment that we experienced. You're right. I will not be back."
"4.0","We made the trek downtown to the Capital Grille for my mother-in-law's birthday in Jan 2013. We're not regulars to this classy (i.e. expensive) of an establishment so I only have a few other like-restaurants to compare our experience to. Overall, the experience was quite nice. We ended up here during Restaurant Week which gave our wallets a break. Our server was prompt and attentive even knowing our bill would be much less than the normal 3-top. I ordered clam chowder, a filet with grilled shrimp, and a cheesecake desert. The soup was delicious and my boyfriend tells me the cheesecake with fresh fruit was also great. (I was too full to eat it and had it boxed up to take home. They boxed it up very nicely for me, but since I was flying out of town for work the next day, he ate it!) My steak, ordered medium rare, came out a bit more rare than I would have expected (cool red center instead of warm red) but it was tender and delicious none-the-less. The grilled shrimp was overcooked but I wasn't annoyed enough to complain at the time. Now, I wont be back anytime soon, but that's more a factor of the price than anything else. It's definitely a special occasion kind of place for me, and I have a number of other places like that to try first!"
"4.0","Great pastries and overall friendly staff! Loved the chocolate croissant. Giving it four stars because the vibe just wasn't there."
"1.0","My best friend and I used to love this place, until we tried going there and they were closed when they were supposed to be open, and when we called to see when they'd open, I was hung up on, twice in a row. None of my friend group plans on returning, and we're spreading the word at our school as well."
"5.0","First time stopping in and was greatly pleased by the sandwich choices as well as the prices. I had the North Shore sandwich and really enjoyed the combination of flavors and left satisfied with my choice."
"2.0","Been here today for lunch! I'm a super fan of vegan cafes and always in search of good ones across the country. Got the famous Pangoa bowl and a Baja wrap! With extra tofu and falafel balls. The taste was just OKAY! There was more rice than actual beans and veggies. Like a thin layer of beans corns avacado cherry tomatoes that's all! If it was not for the extra falafel balls I don't think so I'd like it at all. The cafe is beautiful and in downtown. Friendly staff. Overall okay place can stop by for a quick bite."
"5.0","I love Caffe Mona!!!  There food is amazing and the staff is extremely friendly and welcoming.  Their coffee and food is amazing and fresh.  This time, we ate on their back porch which is so vibrant and cute.  This is the perfect breakfast/lunch spot!  Will be coming back often :)"
"4.0","The food and drinks we got were all really great. Our server was friendly and attentive. We we're seated down in the lower bar section which was fine, quieter than upstairs I think. My biggest complaint is I wish they had a build your own ramen. Start with a veggie or meat base and pick your ad ins. That would have been ideal for me. As far as the food goes, the beet Kim Chi was so much better than I thought it was going to be. And the pork Bao, was out of this world! The pork melted like it was butter and the Mayo I could eat on anything. My ramen was good, I did not love the onsen egg and wish it was the nitamago instead. The onsen egg didn't really add anything to it, in my opinion, it just melted into the bottom. We added some of our beet Kim Chi into our bowls and it added a really great flavor. We will definitely be back and I hope to try the dessert bao next time!"
"3.0","Wish I could give 3.5 stars. I've heard from several people that this place was great so I was a little shocked that it didn't have better reviews. I've never had ramen before other then top ramen of course! Everyone raves about how great ramen is so I was disappointed that I wasn't really impressed.  The majority of the ramen is made with a mix of pork broth and chicken broth so my options were only 3 ramen bowls. I went with the dan dan. It had a little heat to it since there was kimchi in the soup. I didn't care for the egg in it though. The noodles could be cooked a little more too. My table started with the fried cauliflower. It was ok but not great. Not sure if I'll try ramen again. Just wasn't impressed."
"3.0","The food itself was good but I wouldn't get the oysters. I had a business lunch here today and about 5 hours later puked my guts out"
"4.0","One of my family's favorite place! This is a family style restaurant, so get ready to debate on what dishes will be ordered. The serving sizes are true to the descriptions.  I've been going for years, including during my pre-gluten free days. We LOVE the garlic bread and margherita pizza,. Unfortunately, the percentage of gluten free dishes on the menu is decreased, however, they do have a gluten free menu. I recommend the chicken saltimbocca. One tip- we never order sides (usually just pizza, entres, and salads) because there is so much to fill up on in terms of dishes. The atmosphere is always fun and they are great with large groups of people. My sister had her wedding rehearsal dinner there and everyone was happy."
"5.0","Subba was my first experience with Nepali food. From Google searches I expected it to be a cross between Chinese and Indian food, which was a pretty accurate assessment. First we had the Sadako chicken, which was crispy and flavorful pieces of chicken tossed with onions, herbs, and lemon. I chose it based on Yelp recommendations and did not regret it. Even after the entrees arrived we still worked to finish the dish. The Nepali entrees (one lamb, one chicken) came with a plate of rice, lentils, vegetables in a sauce, and two different pickled salads. It was delicious. I very much enjoyed my lamb, and my friend talked about his chicken for days after. The flavors and preparation are definitely similar to Indian dishes, but there is a distinct quality to the food. I would surely return if in town again."
"3.0","Last night I dined at Capital Grille with my date to celebrate my birthday. This restaurant had really great reviews. I ordered the filet mignon with the Au Gratin potatoes and my date ordered the scallop dish. My steak was very tender and the sauce made it more flavorful but it was still bland for my liking. I didn't like the au gratin potatoes and my date didn't enjoy his scallops. The manager came by to check up on us and my date expressed his distaste for the scallop dish and was brought out a different scallop dish with 15 year old balsamic and it was delightful. I don't know if I would return to this restaurant. I wasn't blown away by the meal."
"4.0","Lots of seating, fresh food (can speak to Quinoavacado salad), healthy options, friendly and well staffed employees, under $10 lunch, cool music, modern/simple ambiance.  All my check boxes for a good lunch experience.A great, welcomed restaurant addition to the cool, healthy eating options many of us in downtown Pittsburgh are happy to see.  I'm glad you are here!"
"2.0","Caveat that I've only been once, and during their soft opening, and that whether you like this restaurant totally depends on your palate. This place is not super authentic, but that may come as no surprise. I found everything we ordered very heavy/oily and salty. My friend and I ordered the cauliflower and pork ramen that has pork ears. The cauliflower was interesting. But when you really think about it, is a pretty simple dish - one whole chunk of cauliflower deep fried and sprinkled with the usual japanese umami seasoning plus a little sesame sauce on the bottom. The first bite is good, but we both felt that the more you eat it, the heavier it gets and the less appetizing. It basically has the oil but not the crunch or texture of tempura. The umami and sesame seasoning isn't amazing and just doesn't cut the grease. Half way though, I found myself wishing the cauliflower wasn't fried at all. The pork ramen we both couldn't finish (and I love my noodles I always finish them) because of how heavy it was. I see a lot of reviews recommending the vegetable curry ramen - if I ever come back here, I'd probably try that?"
"4.0","Streets on Carson has an interesting and ambitious menu of small plates, sandwiches and desserts. Our table of five started with a varied selection of starters. Overall the prices are somewhat less than might be paid at a more formal restaurant. My top vote goes to the cheese plate with interesting accompaniments. The raspberries & blackberries were very sweet, the Pinot Grigio gel yummy, the candied walnuts welcome. The seeded crackers were perfect. While the honey was a good choice, the menu mentioned honeycomb and a small piece on the plate would have been nice. The bone marrow for $7 is a steal. The wings were fall-off-the-bone tender but a little heavy on the lime juie. Other dishes we had were the steamed buns, the rice balls (small plate of 3 which looks small but gave each of us a couple fork fills), and the pork egg roll. The pork with broccoli rabe sandwich was right on. The fries that accompanied were home made. My daughter enjoyed the Cuban. The only disappointment was the pastrami sandwich which was ordered by both of the gentlemen in our party. For $13, it was a far cry from a real deli sandwich. The soft rye was flavorless, and while the pastrami was smoky & tasty, it was a teeny layer of meat that didn't evencover the whole piece of bread. The mustard dressing was good. This one should be re- thought. We were so stuffed we couldn't indulge in dessert. If your Fido likes bones, be sure to ask for a container to take your marrow bone home.A nice touch was chilled waters placed on table in pretty wine and alcohol bottles, to serve yourself. A good place to go if you have a group with varied tastes."
"2.0","Your typical greasy spoon. The hours are a bit odd; another yelper called them erratic, which is a perfect description. I have seen this place for years and I think I've seen it open all of twice, today being one of those times. It's also very small and manned by Rocky himself, who does all the cooking, so even though its small there can be a wait if the tables are full. They are only open for breakfast, so the menu is limited. Just eggs, omelets and pancakes mostly. The most expensive thing on the menu was $6.99 and you get a very large portion, so it's definitely affordable. Like I said, your typical frill-less greasy spoon.*the Yelp header describes it as Italian, Mexican and Sandwiches (????) which is grossly inaccurate, so please don't try to go there for pasta or tacos"
"1.0","I came on the fourth of July, so granted it was a holiday but the service was absolutely horrible. We were seated at our table and 15 minutes went by before our presence was even acknowledged. I had to ask if a server was coming to us, after being told one was on the way 5 more minutes passed until the server actually arrived. I haven't even mentioned the insane amount of time it took us to get our water and then food (*psst* 50 minutes). Just overall insanely slow. Will never return."
"2.0","Everything was ok except for the grilled chicken, it was dry and tough and the staff swears its done correctly. The backup manager was very rude and passive aggressive. Thankfully at least the waitstaff  knows what respect is and how to treat a customer"
"5.0","Caffe Mona is probably one of the BEST brunch spots in Pittsburgh. Caner and Eto surprise you with flavor pairings that will blow your mind. The crepes range from savory to sweet and each bite is perfect. The service is amazing, it feels like you're dining with family. The best place to sit is on their back deck, which has an enchanting canopy of bright rainbow umbrellas."
"5.0","My boyfriend and I went here the other night after running through our normal list of dinner spots, and we decided to try this because it was new.They had a special appetizer (I can't remember the name) that was delicious. A fried bun with fried chicken and kimchi. It was so good. We love steamed buns but this was a great variation. I ordered the Shio Ramen which had pork belly, crispy friend pork ears, scallions, and soft boiled egg. The noodles were perfect and the broth had a great flavor. I can absolutely see myself coming here regularly for some ramen during the colder months. I think it will hit the spot.We ordered draft beers. They were smaller than I expected, but we also ordered a 9.7% beer, so that's probably fine!The staff are efficient and friendly. We got to sit right in front of the kitchen which was a cool experience. They did a great job with a big space.This restaurant is a wonderful addition to Lawrenceville and I will absolutely be back!"
"4.0","Tram's is one of the best options for quick and healthy vegetarian/vegan food in the Lawrenceville area.  I am obsessed with the 'tofu and veggies' (same item on the appetizer list and the noodle entree section)-- it is a cold dish with a piquant, vinegar-based sauce and lots of fresh herb leaves with julienned veggies and a well-cooked tofu with an excellent texture.  I crave this stuff.  It tastes so good that it's shocking how healthful it actually must be.  Other favorites are the spring rolls, the vermicelli with tofu and vegetables (hot dish with a different sauce and vegetables), and the pho soup.  The complaints in other reviews are spot-on: it is cash only and BYOB, a bit cranky and rushed service-wise at times, and not the most restful decor and interior (noise from tv and staff's children and dated plastic tablecloths/decor).  Don't let that stop you from going."
"4.0","When I found out this place was a child of Eat n' Park I knew I had to check it out. The format is a little different than I thought it would be, you place your order, walk through the line of toppings and dressings then the employee chops and mixes it all together and you are done! I decided on the Fiesta Chicken salad over making my own and paired it with a cup of the Potato Soup. After sitting down with my drink, about 5 minutes later my order arrived. The Portion of the salad is HUGE! I am a bigger guy and could only eat half saving the other half for later.The soup was a perfect temp and helped with the cold snowy weather outside. The staff were all courteous and helpful and the atmosphere had a cafeteria vibe. My friend had a Superburger with Fries and he also said it was good and reasonably priced. If you are in the mood for a large salad with a wide selection of toppings, or a burger or grilled cheese, definitely worth the stop!"
"5.0","When in The Strip there are so many 'must see' shops and restaurants, but the consistency of Luke Wholey's restaurant keeps this brick and mortar at the top of my list. This restaurant does it all. Established in 2012, the full service restaurant and bar is complete with an oyster and sushi bar as well. The menu has every type of seafood under the sea, and a huge variety of lunch and dinner entrees. From simple fried cod sandwiches, to decadent Baja shrimp scampi linguini, to lighter fare salmon and beet salads, starters like lobster bisque soup, shrimp cocktail, an entire sushi menu, and even burgers, I would imagine there's something here for everyone. Being a vegan my go-to is always vegetable sushi and their side house salad - a generous portion of greens, carrots, cucumber, cherry tomato, red onion, topped with house-made croutons and their house-made salad dressings. Sounds simple, but it's perfectly delicious, always hits the spot, and is always fresh as can be. Their full bar menu always has a great selection of draft beer and bottles, with lots of local brews in the mix. If you're ever in the mood for a Bloody Mary and you haven't yet tried theirs, Wholey's is THE place to get one. My boyfriend cannot get enough and has yet to find one, in and outside of Pittsburgh that holds a candle to theirs. Option to get yours topped with a slice of bacon, shrimp cocktail, or go big with the fried crab. Aside from all the food and drink being top notch, the staff is so cheerful and eager to serve you. In the warmer months the retractable windows/doors open and some tables are right in the fresh air. The bar area is nice and open with several TVs, snag an empty seat if you see one! This place is always bustling, always packed with people, but that means they're doing something right. Great experience, great service, great food, what more could you ask for. Looking forward to my next stop in!"
"4.0","Solid Pizza at a fair price.I get this for work a lot and have found the quality to be consistent.  It's not the greatest pie ever but for the price it's good and the pies area good size."
"4.0","I stopped in to Benny's for the first time for lunch and got a slice of the Buffalo Chicken pizza. The slice was MASSIVE. It's a little thicker than your typical NY slice, but it's one of the better options for pizza on East Carson. I live a block away from Benny's, so I will definitely be back!"
"4.0","The best salad I have had in a loooonnnggg time!  Another Hello Bistro and in a great spot downtown.You can build your own salad or pick one of the many on the menu.  I opted for the Caribbean Shrimp Salad that had lots of fresh greens, some marinated shrimp, avocado, black beans, corn, tortilla strips that added a nice crunch and a very good citrus lime vinaigrette.  Don't forget the fresh cut french fries.  Oh So Good!Some great Boylan's Red Root Beer, too."
"4.0","I love this cute cafe and I'm so happy it's in my neighborhood. I walk here often for breakfast and a caffeine fix. There are a lot of drink options. Whether you are looking for a basic cup o' joe or some frou-frou blended stuff, you can find it here. The breakfast sandwiches are super yummy and made to order. If it's busy or if you're with a large group, sandwiches may take a while to appear, but you're not going to get a better breakfast sandwich for the price so just sit back and chat with the locals. The coffee is decent. It's not the best in the city but it's definitely your best option in and near the Duquesne Heights area. The owners are always so friendly and welcoming! It's truly a treat every time I visit."
"5.0","After a long and disappointing search for good Philly cheesesteak we end up at this place while visiting on our way back to Mass from Michigan and this place was amazing. They catered to all of our dietary needs without complaints and gave us the most magnificent meal we had all week!!! The fires we crispy and delicious, they came with the sub. The sub bread was toasty and yet soft, the meat was well seasoned and delicious and The cheese gooey! Uuuhm so yum!"
"5.0","I visit Pittsburgh frequently and had been looking forward to trying out this place after having read the reviews.Wow... The guy really knows his trade. The food is on par if not better than the majority of well known/respected vietnamese places in Los Angeles. BTW, the owner is hilarious. Someone mentioned in another review he was a mind reader... I totally get it. Lol.Since it was our first time there, we had no clue on what to get, we were stumbling over ourselves when the owner comes over and says 'YOU. Get this.' And points at the menu. 'You will like with your wine' holy smokes was he right :) loved the food!Btw. Did I mention BYOB??? No corkage fee either. Score.One and only thing to keep in mind is the establishment is CASH ONLY."
"1.0","I thought the food and the service were both equally as bad. I ordered a cheese steak and there was l barely and meat and I found it very undercooked. The owner was beyond rude and could care less about a repeat customer. Thumbs down"
"3.0","It was alright, but wouldn't get it again. Order the cheese dip and a jumbo burrito. The dip was soupy with chunks of cheese in it (wasn't suppose to be that way). Burrito was decent. The jumbo burrito is HUGE! Enough for 3 meals. So you get your moneys worth on that. Wasn't the best burrito I've had, but not the worst either. Overall average but not worth going back."
"3.0","Great atmosphere and tasty pastries! I got vanilla cream & chocolate chips in croissant and apricot pastry. They were both tasty! There's so many good looking pastries I wanted to try so I definitely will come back. They had pastry samples on the counter so you can try those and have little taste of each yummy stuff. By the way, service and coffee were just a OK."
"3.0","This place had great reviews so I thought I would give it a try. The mango lassi was good but the tea with 'Indian spices' was amazing. We ordered the steamed momo dumplings and they were good the sauce was a little more spicy than you would want. The lassi was a perfect compliment. We tried the chicken and lamb napali dishes. These are spicy. Very good but spicy. This was a nice touch of out of the ordinary but I don't need to go back. Unless they start serving that tea to go."
"5.0","I think this is a fantastic small place for lunch.  The food is basic but good and homemade.  The price is right for an appropriate size for lunch. I got the homemade basil and tomato soup and a half sandwich for $5.  It was the perfect size without feeling completely full.  The salad is also pretty good.  There's so many fast food joints in downtown Pittsburgh...Apollo Cafe is quite refreshing for a lunch option. I will keep coming back here."

"5.0","Love this place; not fancy, but you get an enormous amount of delicious middle-Eastern/Indian food under 10 bucks. The staff is friendly and helpful if you have any questions about the dishes. My favorite is the saag panneer and stewed chick peas. It's enough for 3 meals."
"3.0","Dive bar and greasy spoon like only Pittsburgh can do it. The food and ambiance are exactly what you would expect from such an establishment.  If you expected more and didn't get the gist of this joint walking in, that's your fault."
"5.0","Our experience was incredible. We've tried all the high end places in Pittsburgh but they're doing service right at the capital grille. Our server was Maria who was super engaging, attentive, knowledgeable and most importantly genuine. I really hope other high end restaurants learn this take on service. The entire staff was helpful, especially as I was looking around for the restroom another server asked if she could walk me to it. Our food was great and I didn't expect anything less considering the clientele. We had the calamari which was breaded perfectly. I had the filet my boyfriend had one of the mushroom rub strip steaks. Both cooked perfect and melted in your mouth. Overall loved the entire evening and we cannot wait to come back. Keep it up! P.s. ask for Maria!"
"5.0","I have been visiting The Yard for a few years so it's probably time I left a review. This location is the first The Yard location. The Yard is a good spot to grab happy hour drinks or snacks, dinner, or watch a game with friends. They have a good happy hour with specials from 5-7 on both food and drinks. In my opinion, The Yard is a crowd pleasing option - they have food that is delicious and nicely prepared that will suit adventurous, healthy, picky, or junk food preferences. Oh, and they have a huge selection of beer and other drinks.All of the food I have ordered here has been tasty and the service timely and friendly. The best food is probably the creative grilled cheese sandwiches in my opinion. I like to substitute the chips for a side salad, and I appreciate that the side salads are very high quality with nice greens and toppings and good size portion, because then I can eat a more balanced meal (most times I even have left overs of my sandwich too). My favorite sandwich is the shrooms sandwich - the mushrooms and mixture of cheeses tastes so decadent! Maybe eventually I will branch out to a new flavor sandwich... maybe.On my most recent recent visit, I decided to have mac n' cheese and a side salad as all my friends were also ordering sides and appetizers for our get together. I liked the mac, so I'd probably recommend it, but I still prefer the sandwiches and salads so I personally would probably go back those in the future. My friends tried wings, fried mac n' cheese balls, pretzels, mac n' cheese, and poutine. They all enjoyed their selections. I didn't even see my friend eat a mac n' cheese ball - these must have been a favorite for them to disappear so quickly! Appetizers are half off during happy hour so you really can't beat the deal to try some fun, tasty appetizers."
"5.0","I always try their mango milk tea. It's just so refreshing...it's different from the mango milk tea I have tried in Taiwan or Chinese restaurants. But I love both, but I like this one better lol..."
"4.0","I'm surprised they don't have a higher rating. I  really liked it here--food was fresh and tasted great. Menu has some pretty cool/different plates! They gave me soy milk for my coffee upon request, at no additional charge. Seating is very limited, however, which I can see why many reviewers complained about the wait. It's even more difficult for a bigger group. Maybe a better place to come during the week!"
"4.0","This is a great little breakfast nook in Bloomfield! The prices for their classic American meals were reasonable, and the food was good! This restaurant area is small, and the menu is typical American breakfast food.  Not many staff members, and a cash only restaurant."
"3.0","SETTING:Watermelons, that's the first thing I noticed. Patterns of cartoon watermelons graced all the tablecloths. The TV was on and showing soccer matches. One of the servers, a Messi fan, celebrated with a 'GOALLLLL!!!' at one point. As a family-owned restaurant, I wasn't surprised to see two of their little ones horsing around near the kitchen and getting into an argument. Ah, young sibling love. Low key 'hole-in-the-wall' spot with smells of an authentic asian restaurant.FOOD:I was a bit confused with the menu. I was here for pho, and I thought there would be plenty of options. Turns out, when I asked about pho, he pointed only to one option (the last item under 'Noodles'). For my pho, I went with the beef and meatballs for my meat and shared and order of eggrolls (2 pieces/order).The eggrolls were moist inside and crunchy on the outside like you would expect. Slightly greasy. Came with a clear dipping sauce. Pho only had a few pieces of sliced beef but had a good amount of beef meatballs. The side dish that always comes with pho only had 2 small pieces of lime, basil leaves that were a bit brown and not too fresh, and no peppers. I was a bit disappointed in their lack of accompanying garnishes. On the plus side, what stood out to me was the savory broth/soup that the rice noodles and meat were cooked in. Delicious and much needed for a cold and rainy day. Unfortunately, having had pho in California, I had plenty to compare to. Although the pho here was pretty basic and satisfying, it would be nice if the pho here had more slices of beef or had the usual options for tripe, beef tendon, brisket, flank, etc. SERVICE:Hardworking kitchen and serving staff. English does not seem to be their first language, so sometimes it is a bit difficult to communicate. They brought out spring rolls instead of the eggrolls we ordered and when we expressed our confusion, they thought we wanted to place an order of eggrolls in addition to the spring rolls.  IMPRESSIONS: Tram's is a family-owned restaurant, sharing Vietnamese culture with the Pittsburgh community. As a child from an immigrant family, I always have admired the courage and work ethic of immigrant families who are chasing the American Dream. I've heard this is one of the better pho spots in Pittsburgh, but knowing that I've had better (albeit in California where I grew up) makes it difficult for me to go out of my way to come back. When I do have another craving pho, I wouldn't mind visiting again."
"4.0","I'm pretty obsessed with mango smoothies, so this place rocks. The smoothies are fluffy and wonderful with just the right amount of tartness to sweetness. I'm a vegetarian and Chick'n Bubbly is not vegetarian-friendly (nor would I expect it to be, but I thought I would note this anyways). Both sauces smell delicious, and the restaurant itself is extremely quaint, but seems to be popular with students regardless of its higher-than-average prices. There seems to be an abundance of bubble tea, smoothie, and even slushy flavors, and I plan on stopping in to try some more!"
"4.0","Enjoyed my meal at Cinderlands. Bar area is small and you can see your cook make your food from your seats. I had the spices chicken sandwich which was crispy on the outside and juicy on inside.  My one complaint was it wasn't spicy at all but I would definitely get again. Wife got the sourdough pulled pork which was fantastic. The pepper seasoning made it different then other pulled porks I tasted. Best part of meal was the fries. Soooo good. Shoestring with salt and vinegar. Best I had in  a while. They have a small tap list but all were very good. Would eat here again."
"4.0","This place is the best. With mouth watering chicken biryani for $5, it's a dream for college students. I always get my usual: a large chicken biryani. The chicken pieces are juicy and plentiful. But I'm sure the other titems are good as well. One thing I don't like about this is that the spice level changes every time I eat here even though I ask for 7. Sometimes it is sweet while at other times it's flaming hot. They could use a little consistency in this department. All in all, a good place to eat after a hectic day. PS: They accept only cash!"
"1.0","Wow...this place. You'd think the man who invented splitting up checks was Einstein once you meet these people!!!  Took FOREVER To get out of their after we were finished eating, drinking and being merry. Last place I'll ever set foot in here, you be better off going to blush. Oh yeah, the volume on the jukebox is weaksauce too"
"4.0","I had the opportunity to check this spot out for a Wednesday lunch last week. I was surprised at how well done the design is and how upscale the materials used in the space are - I guess I just had no idea what to expect! I had a really hard time reading the menu. I feel like they could help with a definition or vocab list. Or atleast have the servers more forthcoming with explanations to help those that are uneducated. I was curious and asking questions but did not learn much about the menu's nuances :(  I ended up ordering what was described to me as an elevated ramen soup or sorts - 'Shoyu Tare Paitan pork marrow / chicken broth / shoda shoyu tare / scallions sauteed mushrooms / cha-shu (marinated pork belly) 30 min egg / corn / nori'.  I think I made a good choice - it was delicious! Our meal arrived within 5 mins and was very tasty and fulfilling. Great lunch spot or take out choice for those working downtown. Would like to return to try the curry options."
"5.0","After living several different places on the east coast, I became accustomed to good indian food. However, I had yet to find a good place in Pittsburgh...until now. I tried Bangal Kabab house based off of other yelp reviews. I ordered takeout, and I was somewhat skeptical given that the restaurant was so small and there were only a few customers. However, the staff was extremely courteous, and my food was ready when I arrived. Upon opening the food when I got home, the food looked okay, nothing extraordinary. I ordered vegetable samosas and chicken tikka masala. The masala looked a little greasy. However, once I tasted the food, my skepticism vanished. The samosas were probably the best I have ever had, and the chicken tikka masala, although slightly different from other tikka masalas I have had, was extremely flavorful and delicious. I could have eaten all day.I really enjoyed this place; definitely the best I have found in Pittsburgh. I will keep going back!"
"5.0","Great place!  Big surprise to say the least.  Place looks questionable for a family type environment, but walked inside and our perception changed!  Our kids had a great meal.  For the adult, the beer selection is just crazy.... so many to choose it is difficult my wife and I loved it!!!!  Great experience.  Food was very good, place was super clean and friendly!!!!!"
"4.0","This is my 2nd time here and I enjoyed it. I came with a large party and the service was perfect, which I imagine can be difficult with a group of 10+. I don't think I've ever been amazed by Italian food, and this was no different. Everything was flavorful and cooked perfectly, but fairly uninspired. But I guess if you're going Italian you're not looking to be inspired. Maybe I've never had real mozzarella, but their mozzarella appetizer is incredible. I'll never look at other mozzaraellas the same. The entrée portion was an appropriate size. I had a quality experience. It was expensive. It's no better or worse than the other popular Italian places in Pittsburgh. That's all I have to say... If you're looking for an above-average, standard Italian, pricey meal to impress a significant other with on a date... this is your place."
"5.0","Fantastic wrap! $7 lunch special included chicken bacon ranch wrap, chips and home made lemonade! Friendly service and excellent food. Can't wait to come back for the ice cream"
"4.0","Terrible service, food was alright (we had better tacos, nachos, etc) drinks were really good! Huge portion for fajita!"
"4.0","I love Pho, but I haven't had too many chances here in Pittsburgh to try it. On Saturday we were heading to Tram's Kitchen for lunch. The place is quite small and unnoticeable and it was quite packed. We were quickly seated and handed the menu, which is not very extensive but still with plenty of variety. We had the fresh spring rolls, the eggrolls and the fried wonton as entrees and I went for the Mung Bean Noodle soup with chicken for main. All the food came out promptly and was really good and fresh. I have to admit that it was not the best Pho I have eaten, but it was definitely something I would come back for. The staff is very friendly and accommodating as well. All in all, a very lovely and friendly environment and experience and I would definitely come back for more."
"1.0","I work nearby, so I have the unfortunate need to visit this Chipotle occasionally. This 4611 Forbes location is consistently the worst Chipotle I've ever been to. What it comes down to, as it usually does with consistently poor service experiences, is that the management doesn't care and therefore the staff don't care. In-store dining, web pickup orders, app delivery orders, it's all awful."
"5.0","Went there the Monday after mother's day for lunch with my mom. Could not explain how all the hype was worth it. Katie, I think that was her name; made it. My mother usually doesn't drink but our awesome bartender had her drinking.if your looking for a lunch celebration? Please try it out."
"5.0","Great great place ..... always a wonderful experience. Always look forward to going back. Food is awesome .... owner is awesome."
"5.0","Stopped here on a road trip from Chicago to Philadelphia. Searched for best vegan spots and came across this gem. You cannot go wrong with the food here. Everything was incredibly delicious! It's been months and we're still dreaming about the Bunn O - must try!!"
"4.0","Came by with a local friend for brunch Saturday morning. Man was it crowded. We came by the door and stood in the line for more than 20 minutes. It was an very inefficient line system we experience as there is only one person ringing in orders... It was Saturday... everyone wants brunch... Outside of that, I am a fan. Our number was up stairs. Asked to sit at the balcony and we had the best view of the entire stripe. We shared and love the Western omelette and Fresh toast. I am not a big fan of french toast but this blew my mind. A Must ordered. Omelet had super fresh ingredient, also one of the best I ever had. Amazing! Would come back again."
"4.0","I came here for dinner with my wife and some friends. I was excited about the trip here, partially because my wife and I would probably not go here on our own and it was our friend's pick. The inside has a nice modern look. We were seated quickly upon arriving and my wife and I decided to split some small plates throughout the evening.We ended up splitting the oxtail, beef tartare, tomato and peach salad, ribs, and beets. The beets were one of my favorite and had a 1:1 ratio of goat cheese and the maple drizzle on top added a nice sweetness. The beef tartare is a huge portion. Oxtail was decent. I would very much recommend the ribs. They had a pomegranate sherry caramel glaze which added sweetness and was an excellent balance of savory and sweet.The reason this is a 4 star for me and not a 5 is that the time between our last two dishes was around an hour. Other than that the food, atmosphere, and uniqueness of the dishes were great! I would recommend coming here to try some good food that you do not find in other restaurants around the city."
"5.0","The food is wonderful. Fresh, well prepared, and delicious. The atmosphere is lovely and, when the weather cooperates, the deck is awesome. Everyone that works there is always friendly and welcoming. This has become one of my favorite 'go to' restaurants in Shadyside. BYOB is another plus. Hope they're around for a long time!"
"4.0","Neat atmosphere, interesting menu, good bites. I usually get the Udon noodles because a I'm not big on ramen. The udon noodles are tasty and the serving is large.Another tasty bite is the pork belly robota. Super delicious, but, like most robota, not a lot of food. Get two! It's worth it."
"5.0","This is a fantastic Nepalese/Indian restaurant and this is coming from people who have lived in India and eaten Indian in the UK and throughout the US. Everything was good, but you must get the Chicken Momo and the Masala Tea/Chai. The dumplings are some of the best we've had (and we lived and traveled in China too), and the chai is the wonderfully creamy, sweet chai that you can get at any roadside stand in India and only very rarely in the US. Our entrees were excellent as well - the Chicken Datsi was creamy and delicious and the Nepali Chicken was an excellent sampler of various salads and dishes. Go and enjoy!"
"5.0","This place is a must whenever I'm in the area, not sure why I haven't reviewed it yet.Onion Maiden is a heavy metal themed vegan spot in the Allentown area of the 412.I by no means am a vegan, but love this place. I've only been for weekend brunch and have yet to try their other offerings.They serve a rotating menu ranging from waffles to biscuits and gravy to tacos. Each item includes tater tots and kale salad. They also have donuts and other pastries.Even with long waits the service ans food have been excellent. They're located a short walk from Black Forge Coffee and right next door to Skull Records."
"1.0","Hey oyster house! Do you remember me!?  I was the girl who came in tonight, alone, around 8pm! I had a camera bag and a side braid? No, of course you don't because I wasn't acknowledged as a human being! Apparently if you are a single diner you don't deserve to have your order taken or even seated. I walked in here tonight and wasn't greeted, then stood awkwardly in the door way for a few minutes until the bar tender asked if he could help me. I said I'd like a table and he told me to wait for a waitress. Still nothing. No one came over. Then I was handed a menu by the bar tender and sat myself at a table. 20 minutes later, nothing. Even when a family was seated immediately next to me, the waitress took their order and didn't even look at me as I stared at her face and got to point where I had to wave the menu around to get her attention. Nothing. Eventually I had enough and left, which they still probably didn't notice. Make sure to bring a huge group of people if you do make the mistake to eat here, because that's the only way this backwards place will give you any respect. If not, and you're alone, don't waste 30 minutes here without being acknowledged like I did."
"3.0","So I really like the wings at this place. Esp the combination (wings and drumstricks) in the garlic soy sauce. The seasoned french fries and pickled radishes are pretty good too. I don't really like the sweet and spicy sauce it's a little too sweet for me. For their bubble tea they don't really add ice so it's lukewarm which makes it not so refreshing.I went their twice before writing this review. The first time I went there I waited over 20 minutes for my order. They also seemed to not have nailed their operations quite yet since they didn't know how long the fried chicken had to cook in the frying machine. They constantly stuck a thermometer in each batch of fried kitchen to check if it was cooked or not. The second time I went they stopped with the thermometer thing but I still waited over 20 minutes to get my order. Keep in mind it's a really small place so sometimes you have to wait outside for your order when all the seats are taken. As for the ambiance it's pretty cute but again, extremely small. Service is pretty good too.I would go back again just for their garlic soy wings but only if I have the patience to wait for 20 minutes to get it."
"5.0","Closest you will get to a dive bar in Shadyside. I love this place so much. My girlfriend and I frequently come in for Brunch on Sunday and they are very reasonably priced and it's not usually too crowded. We also go in fairly often to drink on the weekends. It gets really crowded on Fridays for Karaoke but its usually a nice crowd for Saturday. They have good food at a great price and everything is baked. We also love to go for dinner during the week when it is nice out and sit outside and people watch on Walnut. The employees are very friendly and laid back. It's a great place for a Shadyside resident go to bar. It's certainly mine!"
"3.0","Tiny little place with only few places to eat. Besides sushi, they offer sushi burritos and sushi bowls. Everything can be customized (e.g. Choice of white or brown rice), different sauces. The sushi was quite good, but they messed up the order by putting some weird sauce on mine (and were then upset when I asked them to make it again) and we never got the Gyoza we ordered."
"4.0","Enjoyed my experience at the Wild Alaskan Grille. We have eaten eat Wholey's fish market many times, but this was our first time trying out the Grille. The raw oysters were great. It seems you can't find raw oysters in many restaurants anymore, so this was a good find for us. The blue crab salad was the real star here though, the crab was the large jumbo lump crab. It was perfect. The sushi was just OK. I was rather surprised by this. I would maybe order it again, but I've had better sushi elsewhere. Definitely will be back."
"5.0","Fantastic food at a great price. I had a vegetarian spring roll and the vermicelli with coconut milk and chicken. Both were absolutely amazing, not too heavy and super fresh. It's put me off your run of the mill American chinese fare, this is the real Vietnamese deal. I'll definitely be going here again. The people who run it don't come off as overly friendly, but they're nice and the food is quick to come out."
"3.0","I had their vegan taco here and I wasn't that impressed. The taco was only black beans, some lettuce and tomato. It was not that flavorful and very basic. I could've made it at home! The prices are pretty good but they need to start adding something new to their vegan tacos. They're just not original."
"4.0","A great place for Korean fried chicken in Pittsburgh. The flavors are strong. The chicken comes out hot. The prices might be a bit high, but the food is so filling and satisfying that it's worth it. I will say the wait can be a bit long if there are other orders ahead of yours. I once waited 45 minutes for my order. But it definitely hits the spot when you're craving juicy, hot, delicious fried chicken with Asian flavors. I have come here a few times not only for their chicken, but also for their bubble tea. Their black milk tea beats a few other nearby bubble tea places, in my opinion. It's creamy and sweet with soft yet firm tapioca pearls. True to their name, this place serves great chick n bubbly!"
"5.0","Amazing on all levels!  Music playlist was fantastic, the bartender(I wish I could remember her name) was FABULOUS and made the best Bloody Mary I have ever had.  Our server (Abby) was the cutest, she was so helpful and accommodating and made our visit even better.  Our meal began with buffalo dip, it was great.  My daughter had the fried green tomato and I had the Jerk and my husband had It's always sunny in Philadelphia, HIGHLY recommend all of them!  Everything was perfect!"
"1.0","The previous ownership was a lot better than the current one. The food and service was a lot better. I had to eat there twice today because everywhere else was closed. I wasn't too pleased with the service so I tipped a little lower than usual. As I left the restaurant, the disgruntled waitress called me and demanded I pay more. She got really rude and told me to order takeout in the future. This used to be one of my favorite places to eat. I'm never going back again."
"5.0","Love this place!  Food and service were excellent!  We had the brunch special with the bacon/tomato/gruyere omelette, the lovely fruit plate, and banana Nutella crepe to finish. Definitely coming back and sending friends!"
"4.0","A nice find in Southside. Some of the non-coffee drinks run on the sweet side but they brew Toby's coffee and the regular kind is good. I had the matcha latte but it was too sweet for me. They have a nice upstairs and it's a good place to catch up with friends, do some work, or read a book. Very chill atmosphere & free wifi (:"
"5.0","The salads. Seriously. They are the best. I've had many different variations of making my own, and they are always amazing. The crew at the Downtown location is fabulous, too, and they can squash a line out the door in 5 minutes flat (and with smiles!). It's really pretty impressive. Seriously a big fan."
"3.0","I was in town and was looking for a good Mexican restaurant.   This was recommended to me by a local I met.   The location was great as it was in the middle of market square.   It was on the second floor which was cool as you could look at the square from above.   I sat at the bar as the conversations are a little bit better and you can get a glimpse on what really goes on.  Overall the place was ok.   My biggest issue was that they didn't provide chips and salsa (free).  Don't get me wrong, I am not cheap but WHAT MEXICAN FOOD RESTAURANT DOESNT PROVIDE FREE CHIPS AND SALSA?????  The obvious answer is this one.  I got the 4 Enchilada plate (2 chicken, 2 pork) with verde sauce.   The chicken was a little chewy but the pork was pretty good.  It also came with 2 sides so I got the black beans and cilantro rice.  Overall it was pretty good.   They could do a few more things to make this place good."
"4.0","Most people know this as a great place for ice cream. But I was delighted to find lots of wonderful options for breakfast and lunch. Although the menu is extensive, they can fix your breakfast anyway you like it. Prices are very reasonable.But most of all, I like how friendly the staff are, they welcome everyone and work hard to keep their business.  I had a nice talk with the owner, Natalie,  and I told her I would definitely be back.One other note, they do catering."
"5.0","BEST pizza in Pittsburgh!My husband and I have been rather depressed - we moved out of Bloomfield and can no longer have our weekly Fazios pizza night!! Now and again, we will drive by and grab a slice to hold us over until the next time we can feast on the cheesy, greasy goodness!If you like thin crust, lots of cheese, and a non-sweet sauce, this Fazio's is for you. Also, their Italian Calzone is AMAZING. They are a small family owned shop and do no sort of social media, marketing, or advertising... all their efforts go into their amazing, amazing pizza.Ten times better than Fiori's, Aiello's, Mineo's, Genoa's, Graziano's, you name it - Fazio's will beat it."
"5.0","The fish was so fresh and awesome. I would skip the takoyaki/octopus balls here, personally. My husband enjoyed the ramen. I would say it's not kid friendly as the place only has bar and high top seating. I would also suggest a reservation. We came at 5:30 on a Friday and were lucky to get bar seating. The steps are steep and not friendly for anyone who uses mobility aids."
"4.0","Stopped in the Smallman Galley for lunch.  Was looking over the menu's of several places and noticed the Hog Hogie on the glass case that separates the kitchen from where you order.  How could I not order that Hog Hogie.  When I was ordering someone nearby said that was their favorite item.  Anyway, the Hogie was really tasty with an apple mustard sauce and it came with a very good broccoli slaw.  Will return to try some of the other items on the menu."
"5.0","First time trying out their lunch buffet. Great vegetarian selection, but I was a little disappointed in the meat selection. Great pakoras, and good naan. We've enjoyed their take out several times before. I highly recommend the chicken malai kebabs as well as the mulligatawny soup. My husband is a big fan of their tandoori selections as well."
"4.0","A huge contrast from the Beehive, but awesome in its own way.The space is really nice with exposed brick and an upstairs section as well. It's big, bright, and clean and the coffee is good.The service is great and the people are really nice. This is a solid place to settle in and get some work done."
"5.0","The food is excellent! Here with my client and she is enjoying her food as well. Thanks so much for a great experience."
"3.0","I have lived in Lawrenceville for ten years now.  I used to love the electic feel and home ambience.Recently like most of the places in Larryville, Hambones is trying to cater to the trendy people.  The food has gone downhill, which means the service has as well.There will be items on the menu not available, including the Hambones stew which is their signature dish.I am sad that they are trying to be a cookie cutter Lawrenceville trend trap."
"5.0","The food is amazing.  Marjorie Simmons was our server.  She was very professional and pleasant.  We wanted to share a steak and she was so accommodating to us.  We were asked if we were having time constraints up front to meet our needs.  If you love food and great staff please eat here!"
"1.0","Be prepared to wait a long time for anything here.   They are always either short staffed or have clueless workers with obvious lack of desire to even acknowledge customers.  With few exceptions"
"3.0","While Girasole serves delicious and authentic italian food, it is not for the faint of heart! The owner here can be very intimidating and if you're here during peak hours like Friday or Saturday night without a reservation? Forget about it.The owner is the one who seats guests, but from what I observed, he doesn't have a very official seating system. I wasn't very confident that he was truly seating guests without reservations in the order in which they arrived. I understand that certain party sizes will be seated before others, regardless of arrival time, but even still, it didn't seem very legit. They'd benefit greatly from an experienced hostess. We had a reservation and were seated 45 minutes after our time. There was a group of 5 that arrived without a reservation a few minutes after we arrived and they were still waiting for a table after we finished eating and left nearly 2 hours later. God bless their patience!The restaurant is very small and they cram as many tables and seats into this place as possible, making it very difficult to get around everybody to get to your table and exit. You cant get in and out of this place without at least a half dozen excuse me's. I know that more tables = more money, but they could definitely stand to remove a few tables to improve the comfort of their customers. But maybe this kind of atmosphere is their goal? A loud restaurant with close seating...very family like. Either way, I'm not sure it's for me.The food here is very good and worth returning for. I had a garlic sauce pasta that was cooked to perfection. My husband had pasta with meat sauce that he said he really enjoyed. My friend and I shared a chocolate cake that was rich, moist and perfectly sweet.In the summer, this place is likely more tolerable as they have outdoor seating, so I might give it a try again come summer. But as for winter, if you want a place where you can have a conversation, good luck being heard over all the noise. If you like your personal space when dining, this joint is not for you! If those things don't bother you, enjoy!"
"4.0","One of the top 5 pizza joints in Pittsburgh. Grab a giant, thin, crispy slice of NY style pizza for $4-$5, sit in the window and do some first rate people watching."
"4.0","Honestly we came here because we really like that movie Big Night.  Since this is a restaurant review and not a movie review all you need to know is they make timpano and I've been obsessed with trying to make it since I saw the movie years ago.  So when I saw a restaurant that featured it, obviously I had to go try it and it did not disappoint!  In the movie they make a huge one but at Stagioni they make an awesome single portion sized one (that can actually feed 2).  Actually, the whole meal was delicious.  We started off with the made to order mozzarella which was so creamy and tasty.  It also came with prosciutto, roasted red peppers and olives and could've been a meal by itself. Then we tried one of their newer appetizers, the panissa, which is a chick pea fritter over a sort of whipped goat cheese that had this pepper in it that gave it the right kind of kick that was so delicious.  Then they had the nerve to add perfectly grilled asparagus and ramps on top.  Amazing- you must get it!  Hubby got the polenta with the olive oil poached octopus.  Not only was it the most tender and flavorful octopus,  we also got a show - the server poured the polenta onto the wooden board it was served on - really great presentation.  My timpano was not only impressive to look at but so delicious.  It's a baked pasta with meatballs and sausage in it with Asiago cheese that gave it a nice little crust on the outside. It was served surrounded in a really good homemade red sauce.  I must admit we overindulged in the apps so I was too full for my much anticipated timpano so I only took a few delicious bites then wrapped it to go - I know it will be even more delicious tomorrow.I really enjoyed Stagioni- the server was great, the wine delicious and not overpriced and the food was amazing.  We will be back for sure!"
"5.0","Really good atmosphere. I didn't care for their tea, but the Burning Witch Soup was awesome. Hint if you order that you may be full afterwards, it was very filling. My daughter loved their tots, and was thrilled it came with Jalapenos. We will definitely be back!!"
"5.0","I'm not one to throw around 5 stars all Willy-Nilly. I have quite literally nothing to complain about. Service was great and the food was incredible. Might be a tad pricey, but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for."
"4.0","When I first saw the size of a slice of pizza at Benny Fiero's, I assumed it was just a gimmick and the pizza wouldn't be very good. Boy was I wrong! The pizza is thin until you get to the end of your slice and that's when you start to get full. Eating more than 1.5-2 slides would be impressive. I ordered delivery from BF's once and the pizza box was so large that I had to angle it to get it to fit through my front door! For $30-35 you can feed 4-6 people which isn't too bad and it's fun to eat such an enormous slice. I did the math - one slice at BF is like 3 slices of XL pizza elsewhere, but keep in mind it is effectively thin crust pizza."
"4.0","Ok, so this place has the whole soup nazi feel. You get a little rushed when they are busy, and I get the feeling that the guy gets a little pissed if you take too long to decide. That being said, the food is awesome (if you can forget about the little food inspection mishap), the waiter has mad skillz, and if it's not busy he is also pretty cool to talk to. I say go, but be prepared and know what you want in advance, especially if you get flustered by being yelled at to hurry up..."
"2.0","I had a large (10) group of doctors meeting this evening who wanted Indian take out delivered to west penn.  After some calling around I was pleased to find out that prince of India delivered to the hospital.We needed the food delivered as close to 5p as possible as we didn't want to interrupt the meeting by having it come later.  So at 240p (since they are closed 3-430). I called to see if I could place the order to give them plenty of time to make, etc.  They thanked us for doing this. 5pm comes and almost on the dot the delivery driver calls to say he's in the lobby.  Fantastic!  I get the food - (and left a hefty tip!) and take it up to to the docs. 5 of them got chicken tikka masala - all different spice levels.  NOT A SINGLE CONTAINER WAS MARKED.   Really?!?  Note to prince of India staff:  this would be incredibly helpful.  So the person who got a level 1 may have been stuck with a 5.  Not cool prince of India.  Really - not cool.  Not a single container out of everything - vegetarian dishes, meat dishes, etc were marked. So it was a guessing game.The naan (enough for 12) was essentially crumbled into a ball - no one could get a full piece of naan.  Oh - to make matters better we paid for raita - but I am currently sitting in the lobby (530p) waiting for it to be brought because they didn't bring it - or the driver left it in the car.  I was told 10 minutes - when I called them at 505p.  We asked for a credit - because everyone is done eating.  They refused. So we have wasted food and money.  It was finally delivered at 5:40p.We have another meeting like this in January and were planning Indian food.  But I don't imagine it will be with prince of India again.  What a disappointment.  Definitely avoid take out."
"4.0","We've been meaning to get to Station for some time, so I joined my wife and her friend as a third wheel on a Friday night. Reservations were easy enough and the restaurant was full for the entire evening. I wasn't exactly sure how to describe their menu... gastropub? Italian? Not quite sure.I was pleasantly surprised with their affordable list of wines and tried both the Cabernet and Malbec, both of which I enjoyed. Pretty standard list of cocktails with a focus on bourbon from what I could tell, and a list of 8-10 drafts.We decided to start with the chicken wings which were some of the most unique ones I've had in Pittsburgh and came from chickens on steroids from what I could tell (they were big, not implying anything else). Crispy/spicy and covered with an oil, cream, and pickled peppers.For dinner I had a pasta dish with pork (which was ham, was expecting a different preparation but was gladly surprised) and a one hour egg. I had a hard time ordering, but this dish was a pleasant surprise.We split the two desserts on the menu including the caramel corn panna cotta which was fine enough, and the lavender pound cake. Not overly aromatic, and a unique combination, but not my favorite by any means.Overall an enjoyable experience!"
"5.0","My husband & i were looking for a place to enjoy the first nice day in Pittsburgh & he wanted to go here. I was hesitant because of my experience last time but i decided to give it another try. I was actually pleasantly surprised. We were sat fast & started with long islands. They were delicious. My husband got the margarita pizza he tried the 1st time we came & said it was equally as good. I decided on a side salad & a bruschetta app so i could save room for drinking (because, priorities right?) both were great & the bruschetta was DELISH! The music & atmosphere were great. I'm glad i listen to my hubby, sometimes..."
"4.0","I've been kinda skipping over this shop for way too long. I've heard good things but really, pizza is not always my go to. And I think I've been missing out. This place is super, super fun.So you go in and you can pick any toppings, your sauce, and your crust and it's only about $8. WHATTTT! Yeah I know! You get a personal flat bread for that low price. The flat bread appeals to me because I like a little crunch to my crust. Personally thin crust is my all time fave. The pizza cooks pretty fast and a lot of people were in and out while we sat and ate. I got a lot of interesting toppings and some fun flavored oils sprinkled on the top. You can also get some cold toppings once the pizza is finished. You pick what you want. It was fun.I will say that this place was better than expected. I liked my pizza and even had leftovers since it was a big flatbread. Annnddd remember to get your card punched. 9 times gets you a free pizza I believe!"
"5.0","Everything is so good. I'm not even a vegan and I've  been fantasizing about their dinner all week. The chocolate chip cookie may be my favorite ever. Chocolate cake- I hate cake but this is the most moist delicious cake I have ever had. The cashew cheese is on sour dough omg."
"4.0","I survived off of Peppi's on Western Ave, for years as a student at CCAC Allegheny campus. After my morning classes had ended this was my go to lunch/dinner spot.  Any college kid on tight budge can assure you that there are days when only one meal is all you can afford.  Peppi's portions are huge and they don't skimp on either meats, veggies or cheese.  One sub can easily be eaten for lunch with plenty leftovers that can be eaten as dinner. Typically for me I get the Cajun fries which are delicious cheap and you get a ton.  They are dusted with a spicy Cajun seasoning and served with a side of house made ranch. Since transferring to college in Oakland I don't get to frequent Peppi's as much but I have nothing but fond memories. Of all the Peppi locations this is by far my favorite."
"2.0","This place is defiantly a historic site! From the floor to the table tops to the bathrooms! I love learning about the history of how places came about. Mary the bartender gave me lots of info.......oldest bar, 1st one to let women in, same flooring, etc. The food is frozen so if you're looking for fresh seafood this ain't it! I had one of their famous oysters.  Very good I highly recommend getting only 3 very filling. I had the special crab cakes & 2 sides. Imitation crab & lots of filling. So I don't need to tell you how nasty that was. My house made chips were good & cole slaw had very little flavor. I did notice-after I ordered-everyone was getting the fish sandwich. So I was like dang! I should've ordered that. My return is questionable. If I go back its only going be for the fish sandwich & oysters!"
"4.0","oh south side bars, you are so sneaky! from the outside, most bars look like a dive bar  with some tables surrounding the actual bar. Walking down E. Carson on a Saturday, most bars seem like they are filled to capacity.. that is one reason why i've never stepped into Mario's. I always thought 'what you see (from the front door) is what you get'. We stopped in last night after my sister's graduation and heading to dinner. There was a decent crowd of us.. my sister, bobby, a few other graduates, her friend who was celebrating her 21st birthday and about 6 other people. Since I live in south side, i had a feeling most bars would be dead on a tuesday night. Mario's was our second stop and there was a nice little crowd in there for it being tuesday! I love how there is a little upstairs 'loft' area. We hung out there most of the night. On the other side of the buidling, there is a whole different bar, another loft area that needs to ANOTHER bar! Holy cow. I never even knew. (of course 2nd bar upstairs was closed since it was a weekday)There was some karaoke going on. Since there was a fun crowd, karaoke was actually interesting & fun, especially when the entire bar full of slightly tipsy people were helping the guy sing 'thinking out loud', lol. I had to work the next morning so we kept the drinks minimum. I only ordered a captain & coke but it was deff super strong and well appreciated. 4 stars for a cool, chill environment and strong drinks!"
"5.0","All I have is a picture of the (INCREDIBLE) miso ramen but we had so much. The vibe of this place is so cool and the staff was so nice and helpful, especially for a (mostly) Japanese food virgin like myself. Will DEFINITELY be returning soon"
"5.0","Fantastic breakfast & brunch place! I love their Nutella crepes and French toast, as well as chicken crepes! Always fresh and very healthy. Service is very good, staff is very friendly. I feel like home. I love the interior design with unique paintings and pictures inside and colorful umbrellas outside. It makes a good place for both winter and summer! I strongly recommend you go and try their delicious menu!"
"4.0","A hole in wall place for Indian and Mediterranean food in Pittsburgh. I walked into this place when exploring the strip district.I got the chicken Tikka masala meal with the rice pudding as desert. - big portion size- loved the butter Nan- Chicken was a bit hard - loved the rice pudding. If you are in Pittsburgh strip district give this place a shot."
"4.0","Good value for the dollar. I had a western omelette and the lyonnaise potatoes.  Both were good. ServiceWS speedy and efficient. This is a greatPlace to grab breakfast and go. Two small issues. First they are cash only. Second, due to the high noise level it's not a good place to have a meal and chat. The flat unfinished walls may play a role in the noise level."
"5.0","So pleased this place opened up right down the street from me. It has quickly become my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh and we have dined our way through the menu. The staff is extremely friendly and professional and the food is amazing. Our favorite app is the pretzel with pate. They have had two versions of the ribeye on the menu and the latest one is somehow better than the first (the celery root purée sauce is soooo rich and tasty). Only negative thing would be they took my favorite drink off the menu (the mezcal sour) but still make it on request as long as the bar has cilantro so I can't complain. Looking forward to what this growing restaurant will have in the future, hopefully brunch someday!!!!"
"3.0","Fun tapas experience in a cool little spot on Butler Street.  Cure is one of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh, and even though Morcilla is from the same team, I probably should have tempered my expectations given that Morcilla is a completely different dining experience than your typical sit down meal.   Everything was good, don't get me wrong, but none of the plates (which looked beautiful by the way) were out of this world amazing.    Definitely an ambitious restaurant (for Pittsburgh) that I appreciate and am happy to see is doing well.  Even though I wasn't too high on any of the plates, I know how talented Chef Severino and his team are, and I 100%  plan on visiting again."
"3.0","I really wanted to love Girasole from all the hype and the fact it is literally always busy! Maybe that's why I felt only 3 stars about it... I set the bar too high before going!We went to Girasole on a Friday evening. Granted, we didn't have reservations, but we were a party of 4 and it was somewhat late by the time we got there (about 8 pm). We asked how long the wait was fully expecting it to be too long & we would have to give up, but they told us only a couple minutes while they waited for a table to get up. It ended up taking about 30 minutes and multiple walk-ins came after us and were seated. Again, we didn't have reservations so we expected to wait, but we were told a couple minutes that ended up being 30.They sat us back by the kitchen. I'm not normally picky about this, but the kitchen at Girasole is LOUD. Lots of plates slamming, and even had a wine glass broken with glass shattering all around our feet and backs. Also, we were weirdly seated under the AC, which kept dripping on our shoulders. It honestly felt like they shouldn't have even had a table there but tried to cram one more in.Outside of the wait and table placement, our server was very polite. They seemed stretched very thin, though. It was hard to get her to come back to the table. Granted, she took care of everything when she did come by, it was just infrequent. The food was good, but expensive for what you got. Basic, albeit very tasty, pasta dishes priced as though they were complex or included expensive ingredients. It's unlikely I will return to Girasole again. I'm sure we ended up with the perfect storm of things to disrupt our experience, but there's just too many other great Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh I'd rather spend money (and calories) on."
"4.0","Service was a bit slow, and the servers were holding tables for larger parties so it took a little while to get seated. I am more of a foodie though, so that part was delicious. Which makes it worth it."
"2.0","So, by 'close at 2:30' they mean if you arrive at 1:58, they will be sweeping up and say the kitchen is already cleaned up and closed. I indicated I was a first time customer but that didn't matter. Boo!"
"3.0","Saturday night. Table for 2. We walked in a little before 8 PM and saw only 4 tables seated (2 of which were larger parties). Despite that, the noise level was insane. I had to shout at my friend and the waiter had to crouch down to hear me. The decor looks like they tried so hard to be cool but it just looks like everything else out there. Or worse - something staged at Target. Our waiter was awkward in his interactions and came off a little unsure. As someone in the service industry, you should know what an Arnold Palmer is. I ordered the Bloomfield and my friend ordered the Fox Chapel (both medium well). It took close to 40 minutes to get our burgers. His fries looked like they were sitting out for a few days and so did my mac n cheese, but to our surprise, both were tasty. Still, you eat with your eyes, ya know? The thing that got me was the fact that they tout F2T, but they drown these burgers in toppings. I couldn't taste the meat at all through the sauteed greens and my friend's burger had so much goat cheese that the meat took a backseat to that flavor. I understand wanting to dress up a burger, but shouldn't farm to table meat be the one stealing the show?"
"5.0","I brought my family here for Father's Day for the Sunday Brunch. The space does not have a lot of tables and is very small so we had to wait about 40min to get a table, but once we did it was well worth it. I ordered the Kofta tofu scrambler with added shiitake mushrooms and potatoes on the side. I was very impressed with the taste and the quality. I am not vegan so I wasn't sure what to expect but since my father is a vegetarian I decided to try something new. The spicy sauce they serve with it is delicious. I also had the pomegranate kombucha drink which was also fresh and tasty. I would definitely come back here for Sunday brunch on my own again."
"5.0","Has awesome deep dish! Used to be 'Little Chicago's', still has great pizza though."
"4.0","I enjoy going to this spot with my fiancé. He loves all the big screens and I love all the drink selections...win/win! I always get the wings. Every time. Sad that the bread pudding isn't on the menu anymore though"
"1.0","Apparently I wasn't important enough with my lunch burger order (even though it was $16.95...) because my server did not come back to see if it was cooked medium, which it certainly was NOT. When I FINALLY got a chance to ask about it, she acted indignant that I would question her then checked her pad, yes, I ordered medium. Then she stared at me. Stared. I have to say, I have never felt smaller in any restaurant experience in my life. Extremely disappointing and appalling. Will give our business to Capital Grille from now on. I urge you to do the same."
"5.0","The all you can eat wings on Wednesday for $9.99 is a great deal.  I couldn't even eat the first portion.  Unlike some places that give you the 'junior' wings, their 'special' wings are jumbo as well.  Bartender actually paired a wine with Buffalo wings.  Now that's talent!"
"1.0","1.12.18 - my friends and I are at Mario's enjoying ourselves on the second floor. The male bartender with the left arm sleeve and beard tending to the far right of the bar was so rude to our friend it was appalling. Who wants to go to a bar with bartenders that are so mean and unfriendly? Don't recommend coming here because the bartenders are disrespectful. And I've been on Maury...."
"4.0","Burgh'ers is a winner for a casual meal in Lawrenceville. The highlights include friendly service, a menu with a wide variety of craft burgers, and specialty cocktails featuring spirits from Pennsylvania. I enjoyed the Mexican War burger. I really liked that the keto-friendly option of serving the burger on a romain wrap was right on the the menu - no special request necessary. There's also a vegetarian option. Very accommodating. The side salad with bleu cheese dressing was good too. On the Friday night I visited there was no wait for a two-top. There's plenty of room for small groups. I recommend Burgh'ers and I'll go back."
"4.0","I was pleasantly surprised by this place and the name holds true. When you first walk in, the place looks old, which can give off a two sided opinion, but then I ate the Corned Beef, which was amazing!  A good quantity of meat and the quality was even better...  I'm from Jersey and it's hard to rival our deli sandwiches back home, but I'd say this place comes as close as possible.  I strongly recommend checking this place out if you are in town for a Steelers game and I plan to visit here again when I come to see the Pirates play."
"1.0","Alexander's offers some of the worst Italian food I've ever had. I went there with my girlfriend and my parents on a Saturday night, and from start to finish the experience that Alexander's gave us was simply awful. First, when we arrived around 6 pm, the restaurant was half-empty (bad sign #1). The hostess seated us at a table in the center of the very cramped and very small dining room (bad sign #2). Then, our waitress did not even come over to take drink orders for another 10 minutes (bad sign #3).Once the waitress finally arrived and took our orders, the food itself offered no relief. My girlfriend and I ordered the Caesar salad - the salads were drowning in Caesar dressing, the croutons were badly burnt and inedible, and there were too many croutons to begin with. This restaurant couldn't even get a simple salad right, but I hoped against hope that the entrees would be an improvement.Unfortunately, the entrees were no better. My girlfriend ordered Chicken Alfredo. Not only was the dish absurdly light on chicken (3 small pieces total? Come on!), the alfredo sauce was thick and gummy to the point of tasting like glue. My mom ordered the Mushroom ravioli, which was completely bland. I ordered the Veal Diablo with Shrimp; the plate came with 3 pieces of veal sliced extremely thin, 3 nice sized shrimp, and... that was it. No pasta, no garlic bread, nothing but an ocean of very mediocre marinara sauce. I finished my entire plate, the remaining half of my mom's plate after she was finished eating, and as much as I could stomach of my girlfriend's Alfredo (which was only a couple of forkfuls, as that Alfredo sauce was one of the foulest things I've ever eaten), but I still was left hungry.The dessert course offered a distinctly rotten cherry on top of this already heaping garbage sundae. We were initially assured that all of the desserts were made in-house, but that soon proved not to be the case. Indeed, for several of our desserts, a store-bought version would have been an improvement. I ordered a cannoli, figuring that even a crappy Italian restaurant can't screw up a cannoli, as it is a violation of Italian Law or something. Unfortunately, their 'fresh-made' cannolis consisted of a pre-packaged cannoli shell, pre-packaged cannoli filling (which, by the way, was gritty, as though someone had dumped in white sugar but not mixed the cream thoroughly enough for the sugar to dissolve), and put the two together in the kitchen. Needless to say, my cannoli was awful. My girlfriend ordered the tiramisu, and what she received was about as far removed from tiramisu as one can get. There were almost no ladyfingers, and the ones that were in the dish were drowning in coffee. On top of that, the dessert was swamped with an excessive amount of coffee-flavored cream that essentially destroyed the dish. My uncle's chocolate cake was dry and uninspiring; a store-bought cake would have been more moist.I did not pick up the check - my uncle was nice enough to do that - so I did not see the final bill. However, they could not have paid me to eat this often-inedible food. The service was slow and inattentive, the food was simply awful, and I left hungry. Do not waste your time, your money, or your energy with this place, as you can get better Italian food virtually anywhere else in the city."
"3.0","Definitely not a place to go when you already feel hungry. We wait for more than an hour to get our order. The noodle didn't seem to fully cooked and the broth is salty. Would not come back"
"3.0","We had:QUESO EN ACEITE - yum. manchego cheese on carbs is good.PULPO ESCABECHE - perhaps the most disappointing dish of the night. There were three tiny bits of Octopus. $14 for pretty much potatoes is a biiiit pricey, my friend!PORK BELLY A LA PARRILLA - perhaps our favorite of the night. An explosion of all the right flavors.BLISTERED PADRON PEPPERS - nice light snack.COSTILLAS DE LA MATANZA - we ordered a half rack, we thought these were just okThe cocktails were good. I recommend the Humo y Vino. Mezcal is da best.All in all, for the above and four cocktails we paid $120ish + tip. TL;DRSmall portions, kinda overpriced, good cocktails, not enough Octopus, attentive service."
"4.0","I ordered goat vindaloo garlic naan n mango lassi,I was pretty happy with my order,goat was well cooked and tasted nice. They take their spice level pretty seriously so be careful,I got level 6 and it was pretty spicy. Mango lassi was great, n my dish came with rice. Delivery was very fast as well. I just wished few more goat pieces in there."
"2.0","Wow.  So much to say about the Thanksgiving 2015 experience. I realize the last time I reviewed Buca was in 2007, and my have things changed.  It's a chain, I get that, more on that later.  We arrived with a reservation for 6 but added two who were not eating.  That threw them through a bit of a loop but they handled it well.  If it weren't for the staff being able to rework the reservation, they would have gotten 1 star.What I remember most fondly about Buca was their garlic bread with cheese.  It used to be served in this cast-iron pie dish.  Not anymore. Instead, this gummy, undercooked (COLD) garlic bread arrived at the table.  I guess cold is the theme for the meal.  The house salad did fine but was sort of not impressive enough to distract from the cold bread.  Wine was served.  And drank.  And drank.  Because it took our food FOREVER to come.  We ordered the traditional Thanksgiving meal for 10 and a large side of pasta (when in Rome).After our meal arrived, we dug in.  Turkey Breast (so SO DRY) on top of stuffing (which most folks liked) both were COLD.  Mashed potatoes (those were pretty good, but cold.. If they weren't cold, I would have had seconds). Green beans (cold).  We told the waitress but she was empathatic.  The manager came out and offered to give us more food but because we had waited SO LONG to begin with, we dug in and didn't find it necessary to wait again for more food.  Pasta dish was cold on the top and hot on the bottom.I think a lot could improve on this visit.  The restaurant wasn't packed, so there was definitely some disconnect between the kitchen and the servers.  I likely will not return to Buca.  The empathetic management and poor quality of food is just not worth the expense."
"5.0","My go to for Japanese! Perfectly portioned smaller style Japanese street or narrow bar Shinjuku style plates. We literally sampled the entire menu while sipping on hibiki 12 yr.Cocktails were on point with beautiful floral hints  but I still kept loyalty to my Japanese single malts after. Sashimi was well prepared and the cuts just melted in my mouth. The wagyu was cooked perfectly and I probably could've eaten the whole cow if prepared that way.  That would be a pretty long skewer! Long enough to poke an ugly naked guy across the street (sorry had to make the Friends reference)Temaki was beautifully presented and one of the best rolls I've had in Pittsburgh. Overall? Great atmosphere, phenomenal food, and can't beat the price. I'll be back many more times."
"5.0","Worth the drive into a slightly sketchy part of town. The Fist Full of curry was amazing! We also loved the hot dogs (trooper, Hang Ten and Kimmy Gibbler) and the Fresh Prince Rolls. Headbanger Balls and Straight to Hell were also well received by our friends."
"4.0","My girlfriend and I like stopping here on our early (okay 2PM) Saturday adventures. Close to where we live is this Shadyside location right on the edge of bustling Walnut Street. When we've gone later in the day you may find lesser stock of bagel varieties but nothing that is too off-putting. The service is average but the staff are nice enough and the food is prepared fresh to order. The location itself could use some better cleaning at times but it seems like they have 2-3 people working at a time. Another poster commented on the parking situation, I've always parked in the large lot next to Bruegger's (Walnut and Aiken) without issue. I've actually never even seen a parking attendant in the area, maybe it's just a weekday thing. Overall an acceptable place to grab a quick bite, good overall taste and quality!"
"4.0","Service staff is really nice. The offer you a tasting of champagne when you come in.  I only ordered mid courses - so I'm coming back to try the entrees sometime. Ate the deviled eggs which had just lovely flavor. I recommend.Also ordered the beef tartare. You get a really nice size portion. It was tasty but the lemon just was just a little overpowering. Would like something more savory. I will come back."
"1.0","There's a reason no one's reviewed this yet, and that's because this is a horrible, horrible bar.  The patron are rude AND nondescript. There's always a fratboy 'we didn't know what else to do tonight but wanted to pick up girls' vibe and the bathroom lines are so so so long on weekends. And the wait to get drinks can be pretty freaking long too.It gets one star only because they do have alcohol."
"2.0","This is a neighborhood Denny's with a bar. Small place and the meal was served on plastic plates and they used plastic mugs for coffee. At best, less than mediocre breakfast. Pamela's was closed and we were really hungry. Service was slow but they were nice about it. I don't plan to return and would choose an alternative."
"2.0","I always come here with my coworkers for lunch and this time I was very disappointed with the service. I work in a call center and always loved hello bistro because they chopped the salad so I could eat between calls. This time they refused to chop it. I get that most of it is small but the leafy greens aren't small pieces. Also, the older woman with gray hair in a pony tail was just rude. Do better hello bistro!!"
"3.0","Cash onlyYou'd never find this place if you weren't looking for it - a tiny little diner near the hospital. Their hours are somewhat erratic, I believe they're closed Fridays and only open until 1 on Saturday. Upon entering you're greeted with a prominent view of the kitchen(One guy cooking on what appears to be a standard stove), a breakfast bar that seats about 15, and about 10 tables that could seat 2-4.  We sat ourselves at one of the few open tables, the people inside were a few senior couples, one lone older man at the counter, and a young couple. Just about everyone seemed to be a regular and know each other by name. Their menu lists breakfast and lunch, with most of their 'a la carte' breakfast items being a few bucks each, and their breakfast plates being about $5. I got an egg sandwich with homefries and coffee for $5, my girlfriend got 2 eggs with toast, homefries, and juice for $6. My girlfriend asked if instead of meat she could get cheese and the eggs scrambled. When the waitress took the order back the guy behind the counter started at the slip in a 'what the hell?' kind of way but didn't complain.Our food arrived in less than 5 minutes, a large plate which had a sizable amount of food on it considering the price, and very few frills. Our coffee was kept full and our order was correct, no items having been forgotten. None of the food was notably good, but it was all tasty and had a 'homecooked'('rustic'?) feel to it. Also, bonus points that the eggs and homefries we were served were not dripping in industrial butter-like oil.A point worth noting is that while our waitress was very nice to us, it appears they are happy to tell it to you like it is, telling and older man who seemed to be a regular after quite a bit of chit-chat that if he couldn't finish his meal by 1pm then he ought to not bother ordering.  For $11 and a tip we got a  2 decently sized breakfasts, juice, coffee, and extremely quick service. $6 is about as expensive as anything in there is, so I'm sure we'll be in here on many weekend mornings in the future."
"5.0","Whenever I usually have a restaurant to recommend to a friend in Oakland, I usually say Beta Bites. It's location on S. Bouquet Street seems to cause it to fall under the radar for most people who are used to more well known South Oakland eating establishments like Antoon's, Sorrento's, Campus Deli, Spice Island, Las Palmas, etc. Personally, I think it's one of Oakland's best kept secrets that you accidentally stumble upon after a long night of debauchery on the weekends, especially if you have no idea how you got to that part of S. Bouquet Street in the first place. Asides from the mystique of the place, the food is excellent (special shout out to their French Fries and Kufta Panini). The food may take a while to serve since usually 1-2 people are working there at a time, but it's so worth the wait. Enjoy and tell all of your friends about this place!"
"5.0","Went here with a friend last week. I could not stop talking about how amazing my meal was for days later. I ordered the Chiang Mai Mee with chicken. I'm a sizeable guy, so it didn't quite fill me up, but I took the leftover curry sauce home and there was enough for a good two more bowls of rice. We also split an appetizer platter. The peanut sauce was amazing. Seriously, this was possibly the best meal I've had in Pittsburgh. For the price, the quality and amount of food was an incredible value. The staff were quiet, but friendly. Food was served in a very timely fashion. Seriously, I would return here over Smiling Banana Leaf or Pusadee's Garden any day."

"5.0","My goodness! What's to be said that hasn't already been spoken! Thai Gourmet is amazing! The ingredients are quality and fresh, the atmosphere is welcoming and the spice levels are true to expectations! I recently went there for a dinner with some friends and the Thai fried rice was messed up delicious. You will notice the reviews that say that the portions are huge and that is absolutely correct. However, I managed to stuff my face until my plate was empty and I am well known for leaving a plate pretty full! I ordered a 7...solid for anyone looking for as much heat as possible without overpowering the nuances of the dish. Nothing negative to say in the slightest. Perfect meal."
"3.0","The place holds tradition in Pittsburgh and the north side, that's the best part of it. The place itself is not very clean, the fries are too greasy but the subs are good."
"4.0","We stopped here for breakfast while in Pittsburgh on a Sunday morning. Upon arriving, the cafe looked pretty busy, but we were able to be seated in an annex area of the restaurant.The service was alright. It was clear that the people working here were kind and upbeat, but it didn't seem like they had enough staff to take the orders, make drinks, serve food, and watch the door. Our server was a nice guy, but he took 10 minutes to bring us coffee and waters and forgot to put in our order, so we ended up waiting longer than we'd expected for food. The food itself was awesome. I loved the spinach and mushroom omelet I ordered. It was the perfect amount of greasy and healthyish breakfast food all on one plate! I also asked for jam and received the most wonderful apricot compote I've ever tasted. It was like pure heaven in a little jam dish. I would go back to Coca Cafe and I would recommend it to others. My only concern is that if the restaurant is busy, be prepared to wait a while."
"5.0","Had small plates and drinks with friends mid-week and the food was amazing!!! The Brussels sprouts were so delicious we got two orders. Our server Melissa was fantastic though the place was clearly busy.  We even got to compete in a music trivia competition which was super fun and unexpected.  The neighborhood was really charming, walked over from the Incline. Would definitely come back the next time I'm in Pittsburgh! Highly recommend!"

"5.0","My sweet, sweet Lord, Pamela's is Heaven on Earth. I brought out of towners, because I had heard it was a Pittsburgh legend. I'd heard bad things from a coworker years back, and it just put me off from ever going until this weekend. We waited a half hour for a party of six. They don't have a kids menu, so my daughter and I split a breakfast. They brought extra plates with no issue, service was fast and friendly, the decor is nice and the whole place has this laid back, comfort feel. The staff was all so nice it almost killed my appetite... But then those pancakes came. Don't get me wrong. The eggs were good. The sausage was good. The coffee, the potatoes, the bacon, it was all good, but these pancakes... It was a spiritual experience. Most of the time my pancakes are something that get nibbled on but they are so thick at other places you can never finish them. Pamela's pancakes have an amazing texture to them, they're thinner than normal pancakes but crisp on the edges, I mean damn. I only regret not ordering more pancakes. Or all of the pancakes. And considering they aren't really outside of the eat n Park /Dennys price range, I mean why do people even go there when Pamela's exists. No comparison. Just go to Pamela's already."
"5.0","My favorite place to eat on Craig Street. They have an extremely extensive menu and all of their food is delicious and cheap. My two go-tos are the Beef Lo Mein and the Mala Beef (very spicy). They also have massive glasses of water, which definitely help when you're sweating from all the spicy food. They also have a back room which is great for large groups. Lastly, they're BYOB so you can party it up back there while chowing down on delicious Chinese food. They also have extensive vegetarian options."
"2.0","This used to be my favorite place to eat downtown.  Great prices and great food.  However, this last 3 times I have eaten there, the food has been horrible.  The pop and soup both taste like muddy water was used.  The food was below par too.  The brown rice was clumped together and the chicken dint taste good, it was chewy and had a lot of grizzle.  Most likely my last time eating there.  Such a shame because they were really really good."
"4.0","Very good if you're looking for an average bagel. Nothing like a New York bagel but probably the closest you can get in Pittsburgh."
"4.0","There is typically a wait, so get there early. This weekend, we went around 9:30 and were sat right away, which we were a little surprised by, but there was a wait when we left. Service is quick, and the restaurant is clean.Their potatoes are amazing. The potatoes and onions are soft but have enough crispy bits that the texture is really good. I definitely recommend those, and you can get them with lunch too. I usually order one of their specialty hotcakes, frequently the blueberry ones. Thin crepe-like pancakes with buttery crispy edges rolled up around fruit. Mmmm...I want to go back just thinking of them. I've also gotten the chorizo hash, which is really good, and definitely too much food, but that's what I expect from a diner.This most recent time I went, I got Gail's Favorite eggs. It's scrambled eggs with cream cheese and green onions, served with the lyonnaise potatoes and toast. I thought the eggs were good, but was a little surprised that the cream cheese was just two little balls on top. I expected it to be little pieces mixed in with the eggs. While I enjoyed it, I might stick with other dishes in the future. It's been a while since I got those awesome hotcakes so already wanting to go back to get those again."
"1.0","I was a under cooked pizza and the pizza dough was not done. I ordered my pizza on November 29, 2017. I was to the stomach after eating the pizza. They knew the pizza was under cooked when they gave it to me. The three buddies."
"4.0","Subba Subba Subba Subba... Subba! (to the tune of the O'Jays 'For the Love of Money,' because Subba is like money. For your belly.) This place is delicious. The spice profile is fantastic, and the ingredients always seem fresh - which should be a given, but in Pittsburgh you never know...  I go here for the Nepali food (as that's their specialty), so really that's what I'm going to review. The momos are seriously addicting; so very good, and probably like nothing you've tried before. I mean, yes, they are Asian dumplings, but the flavor profile is not ordinary or 'regular.' Also, the Nepali meals are fantastic, and come in large portions (easily split between two small people) which is a great deal for the price. Plus, the staff is lovely! But coincidentally, therein lies the one drawback... I've never seen more than two people working there at once, and while it is charming and quaint (and again, they are the nicest!) it can make for a bit of a wait. They are always apologetic, and trying their best, but I put this caveat in here for folks who are looking for a quick bite. Maybe it can be quick, but I've always waited longer than I would have expected to. Not excessive or ridiculous, just longer than one would guess for a small, no frills Asian joint. That being said - I think it's worth it! And will continue to wait if need be, because once you've had it, you will crave it - and no other type of food will suffice. Seriously, try this place."
"4.0","Really awesome tacos! I am glad they are on yelp now- we visited when they first opened and I was disappointed that I could not rush on here & rave about this place; now I can =].I am SUPER glad to see another taco place in the Southside. Considering tacos are one of my FAVORITE things to eat, I was super excited to check it out. The inside is small and super cute and the staff are very friendly.My boyfriend and I tried their American style taco, another beef one (can't think of the name) and the chicken taco. We both agree that the chicken taco was the best and is now the only one I will order. Don't get me wrong, the beef was not bad- but I have had better. The chicken is packed with fresh flavors like fresh salsa and avocado and is just incredibly tasty. At $3 a taco, this place is a steal.What's REALLY awesome about this place? They are open late!It was a Sunday night when we visited again, probably around 9:30 pm. I was starved and couldn't think of what I could eat in Southside besides pizza. We walked past this place and I couldn't believe they were open. My taste buds were really happy.This place is great. Go there now."
"5.0","Dare I say best fresh seafood in town?! Lobster was full of flavor-tender, the crab salad was Baltimore worthy. Fresh food cooked well. The friendly wait staff was icing on the cake."
"4.0","Maybe it's the dishes I order, but this place is not the place for you if you aren't into spicy foods. The samosa is maybe my most favorite samosa ever with the traditional powder you would find on a samosa in India. That being said, it's pretty spicy and I love and can tolerate very spicy food. I love their vegetable biryani, though I'm sure it's not as healthy as it sounds. Their chicken seems to vary. I'm not sure if it's the time of day, the chef, or what they have in stock but I almost always get the chicken vindaloo and it's been slightly different several times (sometimes it's chicken thighs, sometimes cubes, sometimes a totally differ color or consistency). It's never been bad, just inconsistent.Parking is limited on the street and pro tip: do not park in or even slightly in the handicapped spot on the opposite side of the street. The man who lives in the house has and will call to get you towed! I would never, but I saw some guy park inches over the line and the man was out there on the phone reading the license plate to someone."
"4.0","Small. Quick. Perfect place for soup and a sandwich when you work on or around Grant Street by the Courthouses.A decent sized menu of hot and cold sandwiches and platters, Apollo Café does not have the large variety of a NY/NJ style Jewish Deli, but it definitely has that kind of vibe with the short order grill in the back and the make your sandwich as soon as you order it front prep area.  Daily soups are right there when you order and get the cup or bowl placed on your cafeteria style tray.  Cold salads, Chips and drinks are all there.  Pay the cashier at the end of the line.  They bring you out your sandwich if you order something hot.I got a cup of the Chicken Pot Pie Soup and a Tuna Melt, which they will ask you if you want it dipped in egg before they grill it.  It was good and the soup was very good.  My sandwich also came with chips. I of course polished it all off with a Cream Soda, as when you are eating at a deli or deli-style place, everyone knows that either Root Beer or Cream Soda is the only acceptable beverage to get.Small seating area on the main floor but additional seating upstairs.  I went around 11:30 and there was ample seating.This place as a variety of Greek options like Gyros, Grape Leaves and Baklava.Will be back soon for a quick mean that comes at a fair price."
"4.0","OK sandwich. I was expecting more considering the reviews I received from my hotel staff. 4 stars for great service and creativity, adding fries and cole slaw strikes curiosity for foodies! Nice twist still missing something."
"5.0","I've never been here before but stopped when my daughter recommend it. The burger was cooked perfectly and tasted really good.  Cool, modern atmosphere. Friendly staff. I would highly recommend a burger and beer from here."
"5.0","My favorite restaurant ever. Love sitting at the tiny bar in cozy room enjoying a delicious Italian dinner with my guy. Cocktails, appetizer to share and entree are all 5 stars to us!"
"4.0","Fresh hot seafood cooked to order.  Can't complain about that.  Market Square a bit sketchy and this place is the oldest tavern in Pittsburgh, so a little worn at the edges.  But that age does add ambience.Odd there was a large trash can in the middle of the bar area.Cod sandwich huge and good.  Wife had baked scrod and it was light and delicate.  Not huge serving.  Fries and slaw good.I will be back if in the area.  Service good between bartender and waitress they had us covered."
"4.0","I ate here with a friend last weekend and have to say it was a good experience. I had the lobster roll and the lobster bisque. Both are delicious and have chunks of delicious lobster. I didn't give it 5 stars because the ambiance is kind of - odd.it doesn't seem like they put a lot of thought into decorating the place or the comfort of the diners. The tables are big spindles that are just awkward to sit at.Great food but please do some remodeling!"
"1.0","Slowest 'fast food' restaurant I've ever been to (foolishly more than once). Customer service sub-par as well - stood at the counter waiting to tell someone they gave me the wrong sandwich and I was ignored for a bit."
"4.0","I headed here for a quick bite before meeting up with my sister. I had like 5 minutes before my bus was due but was seriously in and out in two (phew!!)I ordered the cinnamon raisin bagel with honey walnut cream cheese. I'm seriously obsessed with honey walnut and brought it up to the worker for small talk. He kept the convo going by agreeing with me and saying he loves it on sweet bagels. Sometimes food workers eply with a one word phrase so it was nice customer service to chat with me.So super fast and friendly service as well as a tasty bagel. I forgot to order it toasted but that was my fault.Also I literally LOVE their blue apple salad.. Chicken, green apple slices, blue cheese & nuts on a bed of lettuce with champagne dressing. I have no idea what champagne dressing is, but it's fabbb!!"
"5.0","My new favorite place . Wanted something different. Everything on the menu I wanted. It all looked so good. Got the Meditate Crepe. Every bite was heavenly. Also got a crepe with Nutella and banana and strawberry on top and nutella hot chocolate to drink. Everything was perfect and so delicious. Service was fast and friendly. Very clean place. Its Its beautifully decorated inside it gives you a feeling of being in Paris. Can't wait to go back."
"5.0","Easily makes my top 3 restaurants in Pittsburgh list. I'll start with the staff - so attentive yet not overwhelming. We had multiple servers, and despite the restaurant being full we never felt like we were waiting too long or that they were pestering us. The food was all incredible. Very rarely does my family go to a restaurant where everyone loves every single dish. As it's a tapas style restaurant, the plates are small but we loved tasting so many things and we also didn't feel so uncomfortably full at the end. Get the pork confit, don't even question it. Incredible flavor and the pork was so tender, it was also a good size for a main dish. Don't expect large portions. We also ordered the crab churros, lomo, goat cheese croquettas, morcilla montaditos, leek potato chorizo stew, lamb meatballs, duck crepe, and the chocolate and churros for dessert of course. We loved every single thing, each dish had unique flavors and every plate came out hot and obviously fresh. I can't wait to go back!"
"1.0","I unfortunately have to say that my wife and I agreed that both our meals served were the worst dinners we have had in Pittsburgh. I am pretty forgiving but this was not acceptable. Both meals were served barely warm. The decor was old 70's which could have charm but this didn't. The server was fair. Forgot to even bring us water after requesting it and didn't ask how the dinners were. Both plates were mediocre at best. I will not return."
"2.0","This is my second time here and my first experience was great! I ordered shrimp vermicelli and it was amazing. My friend ordered spicy chicken and that was great as well. So today o decided to get the spicy chicken to go. When I went to eat it I noticed there was no cucumbers and the chicken is sweet. This was not what I ordered at all. I think they do a great job of you order and eat in but Togo orders are a completely different story! Next time I will only eat in. And this was $12.80 a lot for me to not enjoy my lunch"
"4.0","I was at Federal Galley for a happy hour and decided to try the food here! If you've been to federal galley before you know how hard it can be to pick a spot! However Guapo's menu stood out to me and I decided to try it! I ordered the shrimp tacos and they came with refried beans and fried potatoes. The meal was $15 and included 3 tacos. I have to say, the food is really good! The shrimp tacos were full of flavor and the salsa on it was delicious. Only issue was the tortilla was a bit dried and hard to chew. However, my friend had the quesadilla and definitely enjoyed it. All in all a great place to grab food if you're at Federal Galley. Will definitely be back!!"
"1.0","Worst experience I've had at a hotel restaurant or bar. The bar tender was the only one working during happy hour and made comments loud enough so that everyone in the bar could hear about being the only one that works there and threw his managers under the bus too. The manager then came out and was just as rude as she could be so I took my food to go.  My overly priced food was horrible to the point where my family and I couldn't eat it and honestly wouldn't if it was free which it was way overpriced. Example...capresie salad sandwich was on a hamburger bun and looked like it was made last week, cod sandwich barely done, wings very soggy. I'll not be staying here ever again!!!"
"4.0","I'm a fan, but I think The Yard's changed since they opened a third location.  Their grilled cheeses (that's all i've ever gotten there, but the other good looks great) are always super tasty. It's always a touch decision which one to get. But this most recent time I noticed that the sandwich seemed smaller (even my girlfriend's did and she got 'The Jerk' which is usually overstuffed!) and the complimentary soup had less of that warm, tomato soup happiness to it.  Also, what happened to the fries?  I still enjoyed them, but they were clearly a smaller portion and heated up pre-packaged fries that were a bit soggy.  The old fries at the Yard were perfectly fluffy and crispy, you got a fair amount, and you could pick your seasoning!I'll be back, the specials are great, as is the food, but yea, the changes kinda irk me."
"4.0","Ambience: Pasha has a really nice (but not too large) patio and the inside seating is great as well.  The overall feel is very comfortable.Food: The food is very good and a good sized portion, but a tad overpriced.  The chicken is always fantastic and I really like the provided sides of rice and salad.  The appetizers are all really good and the 'Mixed Appetizer' lets you pick and choose a nice variety.They used to have a great lunch special, but it seems that that is gone now.Service: The service is always pretty good.  The last time we went, the servers were excellent.BYOB!"
"5.0","Pete was very nice, and got my food done quickly, it was awesome! And it wasnt expensive like allot of places downtown 5/5 am going again!"
"5.0","We have been there several times with my friends,really nice place for breakfast,I love their nutellabananacrepe and french toast with berries and guys so friendly you should go and try mouthwatering crepes.... i just came back for delicious omlet today, and again and again never leaving this place unhappy .. thank you guys"
"5.0","This place was awesomeThe sandwiches and apps were some of the best I've ever tastedThe piorigi were so freshThe pork and broccoli rabe was amazingA must go"
"5.0","Mind blown. I've been wanting to come here since I heard about its opening and am soooo glad we were finally able to make it here. We tried to make a same-day reservation and the website stated it was booked. Despite that, we called and were able to get a table. So I highly recommend calling even if the website says they're filled. The concept here is small, shareable plates which is nice so you can order many plates to sample. The pricing doesn't appear to be that expensive but it can add up quickly. Their menu was a little difficult to interpret at first but once the server described the different sections, it was pretty simple. Basically, they have shaved dry meats, a selection of crostini, different croquettes, small plates and large plates.  We ordered somewhat of a feast so I won't list each item but each dish we tried was beautifully presented and had a complex array of flavors within each bite. My favorite was the Fois Gras which was savory, creamy and buttery, and sweet from the membrillo (a sweet jelly) placed on crunchy toasted bread. I feared my husband wouldn't like it but it turned out to be his favorite dish of the night as well. This is a great place to go for a date night since everything is meant for sharing. The ambient lighting is also rather romantic. Overall, I loved the sophistication of the small bites and the flavors were out of this world."
"5.0","Always great! Delicious meal!  Waitress was super nice.  We had family from out of town.  They too loved Pamela's!"
"5.0","Great Nashville Hot Chiken! Decor is very clean and unique - great addition to the Oakland fast -casual food scene!"
"3.0","I came here for Saturday brunch in a group of 7. We reserved ahead of time and when we came in our table was ready for us. There's quite a lot of indoor seating and a really nice outdoor patio with additional seating as well. We ordered omelettes, Nutella banana French toast, and a salad. The food was pretty much as expected and the prices were reasonable.Our only issue with the place was that the service was not great. Our server seemed very impatient in taking our order and tried to take away plates before we were done eating multiple times. When we received the receipt, we realized we were charged for water, which we didn't order. We explained to our server that the water was already set up for us on the table when we walked in and we didn't realize it was not free. She told us well it's only $0.50 per person but that we don't have to pay for it if we don't want to."
"5.0","Everything I have ever eaten here has been great! It is also run by some pretty cool people.  I would recommend anyone go here and support this business."
"3.0","the atmosphere was awesome. they have a lot of drink options and a breakfast menu. the food was average but the atmosphere made up for it. for one person the sandwich could serve one."
"1.0","Okay place! Nice beer selection. Good service by the bartender. But the owner seems as if his head is too far up there! He's selfish he's not a people person. I'm sitting here now watching him. I've been coming here for a while now and I've witness him involved more than a handful of altercations. Smh."
"5.0","Just tried Arepittas for the first time and it was great. I ordered a shredded beef arepa and a beef empanada. The arepa was one of the best things I've eaten in a while. Why is it that a lot of the best downtown restaurants are under parking garages? This place is a must try!"
"3.0","Authentic Thai, at par with Thai Tamarind and Smiling Banana as three better than average Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh. 3-stars because the red and green curry are sweeter than they should, and use canned sweetened pineapple that spoils fresh taste. The Duck curry and fish cakes are excellent. The summer rolls are always a delight."
"3.0","Came for lunch the other day....food was good, but service was pathetic. Server/bartender was much more interested in chatting with his friends than providing service, we were the only people at a table, and we had to either stand up and walk to the bar or wave our arms to get any attention, too many other bars and restaurants on Carson to put up with this again,"
"5.0","What a fantastic place. And the food is  absolutely delicious! My favorites ... the classic burger, the ham and gruyere croissant, the smoked salmon platter. Hey! The list goes on and on. And don't forget the soup and quiche. I always top off my meal with one of Ray's homemade pastries. Take your pick. Trust me on this one. They're sinfully good. Breakfast? I do an omelet and then treat myself to either ricotta pancakes or french toast---drizzled with some kind of strawberry sauce. It's my morning desert. This place alone is worth a trip to the Strip. Oh! Mercy! Forgot to mention the BLT on a croissant. Just might be my favorite. Shucks. Least I forget. The grilled cheese sandwich!!!!!"
"4.0","Went there last summer. The food is great, but the thing that I'm not a huge fan of is how small and packed it it in there. In the mornings you can't get a spot so you give them your cell phone number and they call you when a spot clears up. The food I liked the most is their bacon or pancakes. The waiters/waitresses are very professional about everything. You can tell that they have been waiting tables for a while. The wait for your food is not long once you order. I recommend it for people that aren't in a hurry to get breakfast."
"4.0","The food is okay. The setup is very cool. I enjoy the other location in Robinson and this one in Shadyside. I went there for a date and had a good time."
"4.0","This little CASH ONLY lunch spot beside Macy's makes some great, great stuff.  They have a daily quiche and about 4 different soups, usually half of these are vegetarian along with a pretty large menu of sandwiches and salads.  I don't think I've ever had a meal here I didn't absolutely love. I usually have either a small spinach salad (with their dill dressing, yum!) and a bowl of soup or a side of hummus w/pita and soup.  So here's the few reasons I can't give the place 5 stars...  1.  It's a very small, cramped cafe.  The tables are tiny, very close together and when the line goes out the door you may have people in line hovering over you while you eat, depending on where you park yourself. 2.  The ladies who work there are NO-NONSENSE.  Figure out what you want before you get to the front of the line or you will be glared at.  They want to get you your grub and keep the line moving so there is no time for smiling or humoring someone indecisive.  3.  The place gets filled with grill smoke when they are going full-bore at lunchtime.  Maybe it's time for a new exhaust fan...Bottom Line:Excellent homemade food & a great selection of it.  But have your mind made up and your cash ready!!!"
"5.0","If you like high tops and a cool sushi bar vibe this place is for you. The sashimi rice bowl is the best.  Try the bacon wrapped quail eggs to start, as well as the octopus balls.The Ginger Ginger cocktail goes well with this meal. We also had the hot saki which I found a little overly sweet for my taste.The staff was attentive and knowledgeable. Will be going back in the near future!"
"3.0","We were glad to find something open late in the neighborhood. Nice space. Good beer list. I was excited for the grilled cheese sandwich and having lived in the south the fried green tomato was the logical choice. Homemade chips were tasty as was the tomato soup. I have mixed feelings about the sandwich. The Texas toast was greasy and overpowering. Too much bread and tasted like they used Crisco and not butter. A lot of bacon and too little fried green tomato. Overall ok but not what I had hoped."
"5.0","Seriously, just go here. The menu looks small, but everything we had was absolutely incredible. I'm not a huge beer person and had (local) gin and tonic but I'm sure the beer was good because the food was so frickin' great. I'm not going to even try to explain the food because I'll mess it up, but everything we ate was an  amazing mixture of flavors. We had the buffalo chicken starter, the chicharrones, the cauliflower which I would eat every day if I could and we split a chicken sandwich. Really, one of the best meals I've had in quite a while. Just. Go. Here."
"1.0","Just terrible. The entire meal was bland, the dishes and knives were dirty, and the entire menu is outrageously overpriced. I honestly can say with certainty it was the worst dining experience in my life. It cost nearly 70 dollars for Pasta, artichoke dip, and bread. The bread was 6.99...why the heck was the bread not included? I'm surprised they didn't charge for the water. I strongly advise you avoid this horrible establishment. Bucca Di Peppo? More like Bucca Di Poopoo."
"2.0","Our waitress was pretty rude and took a long time to take our drink and food orders (it wasn't that crazy busy). People who arrived after us were taken care of before we were. The specials weren't all that great either. A lot of other Pittsburgh bars offer drink specials during Pens games and this place didn't. I wouldn't recommend this bar as there are far better bars/restaurants in the area."
"3.0","We ordered from this place because the prices were very good, they have a lot of options, and we wanted to try a place we haven't had before.  Delivery arrived on time and ordering was easy.  The pizza, however, had some disgusting crab meat on it.  I did not order crab meat and thankfully I'm not allergic!!  It smelled like rotting crab and tasted the same.  Gross!  Aside from that, the pizza was pretty average; nothing special, but good.  Probably will try other places..."
"3.0","Pesto chicken sandwich pretty good as were the fries. The service,  however, at lunch time on a weekday?  Not so much. Pleasant, just slow."
"5.0","As good if not better than my previous review. I especially love the smaller sized appetizers. You can order several for a fun tasting. Highly recommend!"
"5.0","Must must must haves! What a delicious pizza..  Amazing service... Original flavor  kudos to the chef."
"5.0","Great beer! Subset of what they have at Cinderlands warehouse but I like the service and food here better. The warehouse is new and potentially cannot handle the crowds they see. But this is nice!"
"1.0","Our food took forever and was horrible. My husband ordered the filet sliders and asked for well done and they came out so rare they were squishy inside. My buffalo chicken dip was ice cold and I'm not exaggerating. It was like they took it out of the cooler and forgot to heat it up. When we sent it back his was at least cooked thoroughly, mine was just barely not ice cold. I couldn't believe. Needless to say I didn't eat it. Will not return"
"5.0","This is the closest thing I have found to New York pizza in the burgh. While the slice size is novel, the taste is pretty darn good!"
"3.0","IT'S FIVE DOLLAR PIZZA!!!Okay, I'll be the first to admit that Sorrento's is not the best or classiest pizza joint in Pittsburgh. But it's cheap and open late (until around 3 on the weekend). For college students this place is always a good choice....especially after a late night of partying. After around 10 is when the place really gets packed, mostly because of their $5 large pizza deal (starts at 8PM and ends at closing).The pizza is okay (it's neither outstanding nor disgusting), but I've definitely paid more for much worse in Pittsburgh. It has never been under-cooked and is ready pretty quickly. If you are doing a late night pick-up I would suggest calling in your order to avoid waiting in line surrounded by super drunk college kids (although the conversations you can't help but overhear are pretty funny). I would say splurge and pay the extra $1 for their super yummy BUTTERMILK RANCH (if I could I would probably drink it...andI basically do...) The ranch is ADDICTIVE so I don't mind paying a bit extra. The pizza is hot and super cheesy with a thin crust and okay sauce.I've had times when I've literally eaten a whole box by myself with two containers of ranch (cuz the guys didn't want to share) and I loved every moment of it.....even though my stomach wasn't too happy. I'd say give it a try! Instead of paying $3 for a slice, grab a box or two with some friends and stop by the 24-hour Rite-Aid for 2 for $3 2-Liter Pepsi."
"1.0","This place is disgusting.  Went tonight with a group of nine and they could not handle it.  After three hours, the food they brought out was not what we ordered and it was all cold.  When we calmly approached manager she claimed we made her waitress cry and they were trying the best they could????    Then they abandoned our table and the wait staff began saying inappropriate things to other customers about our group.   At least two of the servers seemed 'out of it' it was obvious.   Avoid at all costs.  Very very bad.  And the food we did receive looked suspect, potential for health issues.  Next stop is city of Pittsburgh health department to file a concern.   Avoid."
"3.0","When I first moved to Shadyside this was my weekend go to spot.  The pancake/crepes are the size of flying saucers and the hash browns are top notch (starchy crunchy goodness).  The lines are long but move fast.  That being said, I find it highly over rated and have since seen the light with regards to other brunch contenders in the area."
"1.0","Made us wait 30 mins before even taken Our drink orders. We were there for 2 hours in total and not because we were casually enjoying coffee. Service is absolutely terrible. Not to mention we left a pair of sunglasses on the table and immediately went back to grab them and they were gone. With the staff acting like they never saw them. Will never go back. Food is very mediocre. Was very excited to take my sister there and I'm embarrassed that's where I chose."
"3.0","The food was good, however, the service made a giant difference in the experience. I was with a party of 7 so I expected a slower service. When a table of 4 left bc they were not asked for drink a drink order after 30 minutes it meant something. It took at least 20 minutes to get our first drink from order to the table. I feel they needed more service staff as one girl did the entire place. She did great, but they need to re-evaluate service staff levels."
"3.0","I was pretty excited to try this new place in Shadyside. The first day I came here.. I ordered the wang Chung grilled cheese and honestly it was nothing special. The second time, however, I ordered the breakfast sandwich and it was great! I would definitely order that one again. Also, I understand the concept of grilled cheese and soup - but the soup is nothing to write home about. But I do really enjoy their sweet potato fries with cinnamon butter - it is soo good. The service was a home run the first time and a strike out the second time even though it was less busy the second time around. Would I come here again? Probably but not for a while! P.S. Their wake and bake dessert is absolutely amazing."
"4.0","A very solid choice for Thai food in Pittsburgh.  Family-run, reasonable prices, good food.  The noodle dishes I have sampled so far--Pad Thai, Chiang Mai Mee, and the spicy Tom Yum noodle soup (which, let me tell you, is a truly amazing hangover cure) have all been excellent.Some of the appetizers I've had here haven't been the best, but overall you can expect solid quality from the entrees.  They often have candy and fruit for you to take with you when you leave!  And the staff is generally very friendly and helpful."
"1.0","I hate to give this restaurant a 1 star, because I have dined here a handful of times with no issues until this last time. If you sign up for their rewards program you get $10 toward your entree and the choice of either a t-shirt or mug. I just had a birthday last weekend so I decided to order a spicy whitefish sandwich to go. This is my go to sandwich when I eat here and I have always liked it. When I returned to my desk for lunch I opened up the wrapper to find what looked like a cooked piece of fish. My first bite into it was like biting into rubber. So I immediately pulled it a part to see if it was cooked. I was extremely grossed out to find raw fish looked back at me. Needless to say I threw it away and will not be returning."
"5.0","What can I say? The owner, Tammy is infectiously positive. She serves a great cup of joe and her specialty drinks are delicious. She is a neighbor as well, dwelling in my neighborhood just up the hill. That said I always enjoy supporting local business especially the closer to home is. She has her own parking lot off Street which is wonderful! She always smiles and laughs which makes for pleasant visit always. I can honestly say I've been there over a dozen times and never had bad experience. I usually go for a good cup of drip, or a triple small cappuccino. She does not charge extra for milk alternatives, or syrup believing that at all balance out in the end. This I commend her for and it does bring me back because of my love for almond milk as well as my partners love for milk Alternatives as well. I wholeheartedly support this place and wish you the best in the future one cup of the time for me and everybody else!"
"1.0","Since WHEN is it ok to talk about customers?..this is allowed?....no type of professionalism. I ho to the store and I get back and my wife tell me the worker wana talk SHIT ON ME.....FUCK YOU...ALL OF UOU....LISTEN IDK WHO THEY THINK THEY ARE..YOU DONT WANT NO SMOKE.Take that bullshit else where..I will NOT patronize that lo action ever again...and trust ...you don not kno who I kno...learn to not allow your employees to degrade your location..."
"5.0","Wow what a great place to eat. Not only do they have rolls but burgers and steak too! The steak is full of flavor and for around $10 it's a steal. Also, while you're waiting for your food, the market is a great place to shop."
"5.0","Last night we finally got our chance to eat at this special restaurant. Having just returned from Spain we were very happy at how creative the dishes and drinks were. The cava sangria is delicious and not sweet with aromatic herbs and infused with fruit. The pickled beets were outstanding and complemented with flavorful goat cheese. The octopus was a total surprise. Not anything like I expected and so flavorful. The bacalao was fried which I hadn't had prepared this way before and surrounded by a tahini like sauce....amazing!The bistecca large place was the absolute best. Tender and served with roasted shallots and mashed potatoes. I could go on and on but the food and drinks were beyond fantastic!Only wish the setting were alittle more comfortable and quiet!!"
"3.0","Over rated steak salad food but steak came cold. Awesome atmosphere Melanie great service but food just average"
"4.0","Stumbled on this place while wandering around the CMU campus. An odd location but the lunch was quite delicious with large and perfectly cooked veggies and meat, service was quick and my lunch was a mere $6. What is not to love?"
"2.0","I got the Madagascar vanilla cream cold brew... but it's just the regular cold brew with pumps of vanilla syrup... disappointed. Not worth it.. I even went to ask if this was correct and the girl just tells me it's suppose to be pumps of vanilla but I can add cream if I want... pictures online are deceiving"
"5.0","Nice place! Delicious beautifully presented  food! Chicken liver mousse is just amazing! Never thought it can taste like an ice cream!"
"4.0","I was turned on to this place by my buddy who said it was the best pizza in Lawrenceville. He was right. I was very impressed. That perfect level of grease, lots of cheese, and the sauce wasn't that awful sugary crap at most Pittsburgh pizza shops. I will be back again many times."
"4.0","Most tender pork I've had in awhile and both dishes seemed to stay very true to its roots. The Cochinita Pibil is marinated pork shoulder slowly cooked in banana leaves with rice, pickled red onions, and charred orange chicharrón. My only critiques are...more rice to accompany the meat, to scatter the cilantro all over the plate as opposed to having it chill on the side, and more sauce. Otherwise, I think Chef Jesse Barlass will be very successful if he ends up opening an independent Colonia!!! Looks like they changed the price and style of the pupusa since I've been!"
"2.0","Ok so I LOVE Emiliano's in the south side and the food and drinks for happy our are amazing but this rating is for the service. We sat down at 5 and got drinks and chips and ordered. At 6 we asked about our food and she had forgotten to punch it in! By 7 we are finished eating but our checks have taken at least 30 min to come. They apologized for the slow service since they are a new place but even the food was different then the usual food at other restaurants. Like the quesadillas did not include the usual sour cream, lettuce, and salsa. Overall I prefer the old location. OK after reading other reviews it seems like the server was our issue and nothing else. I will give this place another try."
"5.0","I was super impressed with this place between the food and drinks. We went for a work happy hour which turned into a 5 hour stay! We ended up trying a lot of their drinks and food, so here's my thoughts...The menu is small but comprehensive. There's something for everyone - from the classic, juicy burger or melt-in-your-mouth short ribs to the flavorful octopus and hush puppy dish. Then there's the ode to Pittsburgh's ancestral roots with perfectly seared pierogi and a haluski and kielbasa dish. The haluski was amazing and I don't like kielbasa but it was a hit with my friends. It was gorgeous and smelled so good - not something I say about kielbasa often. I do have to say that our table's favorite dish ended up being the chicharones - spent grain fried up and served with cheese. Light and crunchy deliciousness with cheese... Yes please. I was so happy that they serve spirits and wine at this brewery since I don't like beer. The rum punch is my new favorite drink in all of Pittsburgh. So dang yummy. They also serve R Winery wines, as well as local whiskey. My husband really liked their double IPA while our friends enjoyed their sour beer. Such a great new staple brewery in a great location."
"5.0","I am very pleasantly surprised with this location. A police officer suggested it to my fiancé and I and we fell in love! I can't wait to return it was the best hoagie I have ever ordered."
"1.0","The food isn't that bad and the drinks are overpriced, especially for what you get. While you might be tempted to enjoy the river view and outdoor dining, the main reason you should stay away is the god awful service. Save yourself the awkward eye rolls and almost open hostility and go to literally anywhere else. It's almost as if the staff and management expect an apology for having to wait on you, but they aren't totally wrong because you truly will be sorry you decided to go to Redfin Blues."
"5.0","I've been searching for this sandwich for 11 years!!!!I ate here when I was visiting colleges in high school. It was AMAZING. I did find a school to play ball at right outside of Pittsburgh but I couldn't find/ figure out what restaurant had the sandwich called 'The Roethlisburger' -- I went all through college wishing I could had found this place. After college I would come back and visit and think 'man I wish I could find one of those sandwiches again'... well, 11 years later/ today I FOUND IT!!!11 years was worth the wait!!!  It was as savory and mouth watering as the first time I had this amazing sandwich. Hands down best sandwich in Pittsburgh. Hands down best sandwich I've ever had in my life. 10/10 - 100/100."
"1.0","Late at night and hungry, I discovered the Cambodian place down the street is a cash-only business. I chose this place because it was the only restaurant on the block with an open kitchen (many kitchens close at 10PM). Desperate times called for desperate measures, and I really should have taken the time to research a better restaurant.I ordered a seafood deluxe pasta dinner and chicken noodle soup. I was told it would take 10 minutes but it really took 30 minutes. I had planned on eating inside, but since it took so long, I asked for the meal to-go instead. By the time I got my food, I was pretty exasperated. The knot tying the bag was too tight, so I was unable to check the food; this meant I left without ensuring a fork was inside.The food was very bad. I have no other way to put it. The pasta was completely tasteless. I know there was imitation crab in the pasta dish, but I can't decipher what else there was; I ate less than 10 bites. The soup was terrible, and I only had a few sips. The broth looked like Campbell's chicken noodle soup (except it looked like the same noodle as the pasta), but tasted saltier. The salad looked quite plain (seen better salads in an airport), but without a fork, I was unable to eat. The soup, salad, and pasta (with tip and tax) cost about $16, so I expect a decent meal at this price.I realize this is a pizza place and I should have ordered pizza, but I didn't want pizza. I also think if you're going to have a full menu, you should be able to properly present what's on the menu. I would've been better off ordering pasta from Pizza Hut. Attempting to eat pasta with a spoon didn't help either. Next time you're in the area, just skip this place."
"3.0","Really great food for brunch. There was no AC in the building so it was really hot and there were flies swarming in the windows. The service was really slow and mediocre. If I ate here again I'd get it to go."
"1.0","Had 5 people come in for my birthday and a huge disappoint is an understatement, charged for sodas we didn't order, didn't get half the stuff we ordered. Then a huge fail to their 'email' club, told they don't take emails or print out of emails. Told they only take coupons mailed, not the email club you sign up for on their website. Not even a simple happy birthday for having your birthday dinner there, definitely don't recommend this place to anyone"
"5.0","Wow! Came in on a Wednesday night and it was sooo good. Great service from a very friendly staff and the food and drink was A+. The aracini is great and the tapioca with chorizo is a must get. Of course the duck fat fries are good (and good for you!)  All around good place and can't wait to recommend and go back!"
"4.0","Really solid place. Expect small portions and not the massive rolls you typically see. It's very good and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly. Great cocktails, too."
"3.0","I love chicken in all of its forms. This place is well designed. The employees are friendly, competent and execute well. The restaurant is nicely designed and clean. The menu is simple and as promoted. However, The product has a major issue - too much seasoning. I love chicken, spice, seasoning, breading and everything to do with all that. The issue is that the seasoning is so heavy you can almost 'feel' it. I don't mean taste it, I mean feel it.....as in gritty. This chicken is seemingly  well prepared but completely ruined by being doused, like with a fire hose, with gritty seasoning. If they would back off they would have a hit. Just back off, just a little, and you will have something."
"4.0","As soon as I feel my seasonal head cold coming on, I know where to go--it's Tram's! No better way to flush out the sinuses than with some spicy as h%*! soup. I usually go for the Mung Bean Noodle soup (with chicken) but there are several options. While the food is delicious, the ambience of Tram's isn't the best so I usually get mine to-go. This is actually even more fun in my opinion because when you get take-out, they package all the ingredients up separately (noodles, broth, bean sprouts, basil, limes, chili, sauces, etc) so you can mix how you like at home! Spicier the better for me!"
"4.0","Definitely don't come here if you're expecting traditional Moroccan dishes. However, if you're looking for a good sub on-the-go, would recommend this place. Other yelpers mentioned getting the Chicken Sharmola, and I'd have to echo their recommendation. The sub came in a good-sized portion - couldn't even finish the entire thing actually. The chicken was not dry at all, and was covered in just the right amount of dressing that gave it a delicious savory flavor that kept you coming back for more."
"1.0","Too long of a wait for your food.  I was on my lunch hour and waited 25 minutes for food.  They need to speed up their food service for a to go restaurant."
"3.0","Always on the search for great spots that will deliver to Polish Hill. Fazio's Pizza stood out to me because their prices were a little lower than other places I've tried. I was able to get a large pizza with mushrooms and a dozen wings for about $20 and I was satisfied. The wings were VERY saucy, and the hot sauce was just hot enough for me to handle, nothing crazy. I'll definitely give them another go and look forward to trying some new menu items."
"3.0","This was just an average sushi restaurant from what I'm used to. The service was great and they provide you with a warm towel before serving you. I only order rolls so I did not get a feel for the whole menu. The tempura vegetables were cooked perfectly to order and had a very nice presentation to them."
"4.0","I love Station. Pittsburgh needed a restaurant of this caliber. The food, drinks, and service are great."
"5.0","This place was awesome.  The breakfast pastries are amazing! I recommend the blueberry ricotta pancakes.  Service was great, very friendly."
"5.0","After a fun night on Carson Street, it's always great to get some food. A friend led us to this taco shop that was open till pretty late. Their tacos are $3 and are a pretty good size. I got carnitas and pollo. They were very tasty and burst with flavor. If you're a fan of street style tacos, this is the spot!"
"3.0","I had read the previous reviews mentioning the disappointing oj ratio in the bottomless mimosas, but decided to see for myself. Sure enough, they were overly sweet and 3/4 orange juice. I probably had a total of 6 or 7 and didn't feel the slightest buzz. Service was also poor and slow. The Yard does have tasty food and is a fun place to come for a few beers, but next time I want a boozy brunch in Shadyside I'll stick to Shady Grove and their delicious $3 mimosas."
"5.0","Greatest restaurant!! Wonderful meals and you cannot beat the atmosphere!! Prices match the quality of food!! Service is amazing as well! Call ahead for reservations on weekends! They're busy on weekends"
"5.0","Really no complaints! Service here is so friendly yet professional. The dishes are creative, pack robust flavor, and are elegantly presented. I was a little intimidated by the prices initially, but the food and drinks were worth every penny. I was also blown away by the classic yet refreshing cocktails they serve here. I would say that the burger here is quite possibly the best I've had in Pittsburgh."
"5.0","This place is really convenient, near a lot of apartments and is a really good local pizza joint. They're open late on Friday and Saturday and they're on campusfood! And they have good prices too! What more could you want?"
"5.0","I love La Gourmandine Bakery! I come here every once in a while during my lunch break at work. The pastries and sandwiches are always freshly baked and delicious. This time around I tried their Almond Croissant and the Pickle Prosciutto sandwich. The croissant was really good with a lot of almonds. The almond extract is pretty strong, so just be aware of that while ordering it! The sandwich comes on a fresh baked baguette, which is nice and crunchy on the outside. The prosciutto and mini pickles make for a great mix of flavors! The atmosphere is very relaxing, sometimes I enjoy reading a book here because it's pretty quiet. The staff is always friendly an inviting. Overall, it's a great place to stop by when you get the chance"
"1.0","Wed. 10/7/15 4-5:30pmI walk into this unremarkable hole-in-the-wall pizza joint, I order a single slice with a few extra toppings, it comes out to $5.31. I hand the cashier my trusty debit card and after a couple times running it, she informs me it doesn't work.'Oh, that's odd. Shoot, I didn't bring my wallet on my bike. Okay. Well, thanks.'I take a step back and make a call to my bank, with all the traveling I do, occasionally security will red flag the card, but a quick phone call will unlock it. Unfortunately, 'due to a massive information leak, a lot of cards have been cancelled for security reasons'. After an extremely tedious round of 'brief holds' and being disconnected twice, I'm finally able to make a one-time transaction at the ATM. Success! Cash! That's the last time I leave the hotel with just my ID and one card!It's been nearly an hour. I'm spent. And really hungry. And now late for my massage appointment. But at least I can finally get this delicious pizza my friend talked about. I go to the counter and reorder my slice. I notice that now it is happy hour and one of the specials reads 'free appetizer with $5 purchase.' Pleased that some good has come out of wasting a hour on the phone, I ask about adding that happy hour deal to my order. The goateed cashier says, 'if you want to order a beer you have to go to the bar.' 'Oh, no beer, thank you, just the appetizer.' He repeats himself, I repeat myself, and accepting we must be experiencing a language barrier, I go to the bar anyway. I try to order my slice of pizza and an appetizer. The bartender says, 'You can't have ordered at the counter already to get the appetizer here. You have to order over five dollars at the bar.'I look back toward the counter, confused. 'No, I didn't order over there, I was told to come here.''You ordered earlier.' (I come to realize it's the same girl who ran my card before.)'Oh. Yes, I tried. But my card wouldn't go through so I called my bank. I have cash now. I'd like to order with the bar so I can get the appetizer for happy hour.'Her tone is escalating in rudeness, 'Yeah, well, you'll have to pay for that pizza from before and then order over five dollars from the bar.' She walks away to another customer at the bar. The gentleman next to me offers to let me order an appetizer on his tab since he has spent well over five dollars at the bar. Gratefully, I accept and we let the bartender know our plan. Again with the rude tone and a roll of her eyes, to boot, 'no. We can't do that.'I'm so frustrated. I give up. I've had it. Forget the damn pizza.'Okay, you know what, I don't want anything. Thanks.' I pick up my twenty from the bar and startto leave. The bartender apparently can't help herself from viciously spewing, 'Well if you can't afford it, maybe you shouldn't be here.' I'm stunned. 'What a rude, bitchy thing to say.''Hey, the truth hurts.'Then she ran away to the kitchen before I could respond.Of course you think of everything you would like to have said later... It would have gone something like... 'Broke? You work at a fucking pizza place, Bitch.'Shocked, frustrated, humiliated, I asked for the manager at the counter. A tall, thin, Indian-looking man stretching pizza dough in the back stays rooted to the spot and hollers, 'I'm the manager, what's the problem?' 'Could you come over here, please?' He sighs and begrudgingly approaches the counter. I take a breath to calm my irritation so I can communicate effectively. At the end of my account, he looks at me blankly, unsympathetically, and says, 'what do you want me to do?'I can't believe it. 'What do I want you to do?!'With attitude he says, 'We are busy right now. We don't have time for this. You want a piece of pizza?! I'll make you a piece of pizza!'(Busy is not what I would call the place. The large first room of tables is completely empty. On the counter side, there is a table of six, a table of four, maybe six people at the bar, and no line to order. Five guys making pizza and two serving girls.) I'm disgusted with this place and appalled with the alarming opposite of customer service, 'No, I don't want your pizza.''Well, what do you want me to do? I can't fire her right now because we are very busy.''No, I don't want you to fire her.''Well, what do you want me to do? I can't fire her right now because we are very busy.''No, I don't want you to fire her.''Well, what do you want me to do?!''Nothing. Forget it.'That was it. I left. Wow. My day really went down hill with the decision to go to Genoa.As I rode back to the hotel, I was frustrated with myself for letting some snotty, trashy, pudgy, $8-an-hour-plus-tips bar tender get to me. I've done my time in customer service and food service. I was great at it. Then I moved on and built a career. Now my work pays me to travel all over North America and Europe doing what I love. Who's broke now, Bit"
"5.0","I can't believe I've missed out on Streets on Carson for so many years! The interior is super chic and innovative, using street signs to name the tables and also showcasing a lot of other creative design choices. But the real star is the food. We opted to get four appetizers to share - Mozzarella Tapioca, Roasted Canoe Cut Beef Bone, Aloo Tikki, and Pincho Mofongo. We were impressed with everything, and we'll have to make the restaurant a regular visit since they change the menu and they have so many incredible dishes to offer!"
"4.0","It's been there for a lot of years I remember going to eat there as a kid in the 70s and the decor hasn't changed. I really like the fish themed decor the only problem is there is no street parking but you can park at the many parking garages which are about 7.00 an hour. Market square where it is located is really nice and looks a lot better than the 70s. The prices are high but it's in Downtown Pittsburgh and they have a great reputation."
"5.0","They have an incredible Crepes! I went this afternoon to Cafe Mona and I ordered the Tuscan Chicken crepe it coms with side salad as most of the dishes in that Cafe, and it's really delicious, the companion of the feta cheese and the artichoke with the fresh chicken is insane!! I just loved it! And I ordered Turkish Coffee couldn't believe how good they made it.The place is Super clean, cozy and they play nice music,they also have outdoor patio and a strong connection Wifi.I think Cafe Mona is my new hangout place. I live in Shadyside and it's about 20 minutes walking. I think it's worth a try. Great experience."
"4.0","One and only Nepali restaurant I've been to but definitely the best. The Nepali dishes are all delicious and very reasonably priced. Downside is the decor and location but the upside is BYOB, supporting a truly local business that makes the northside better, and easy takeout."
"1.0","All I can say that this place is not clean at all (also for some reason the place is full of flies). If this is what your costumers see in the dining area, I wonder what the kitchen looks like... The employees, however, are way better and friendlier than they used to be. The heat level is STIL inconsistent, my husband order another sandwich after he was done with the first and the jump in the heat level was crazy. I went approximately a week after I posted this review. I was very happy to see them improving the juiciness/quality of their chicken and the spiciness levels (I really hope they stay consistent when I visit them next time). However, sadly the place is still not clean (especially the tables) and there are a lot of flies whicI came to this place when they first opened. And I come pretty regularly as they're the only Nashville hot chicken place around. The only reason I'm writing this review is because I would really like to see some improvements. This is the list of things that I think they can easily improve: 1- the people working here have a negative energy. 2- the tables are always dirty every time I come. I think they should assign someone to wipe the tables after each party. Wish they would care more about the cleanliness of the place.3- the last couple of time I visited I noticed that the chicken is dry and not juicy at all. 4- (MOST IMPORTANT AREA OF IMPROVEMENT) The spiciness level is NOT consistent! When they first opened the medium was too mild for my husband so he had to start eating the hot. Suddenly it became too spicy and he had to downgrade to medium then the medium became too mild... etc. As for me (a person who loves the heat) the hot was too mild for me but the damn hot was actually waaaay too spicy (the jump in heat was ridiculous to the point I couldn't take more than one bite) I wish they would either add a new level between the hot and damn hot or make the jump more reasonable (by either making the hot actually hot or dropping the heat a notch with the damn hot) 5- last time I came here the fries was cold and not fresh at all!"
"4.0","This is a pretty good option for market square dining. We made reservations for a group of 8 and we were seated in our own little room which I really appreciated (the main dining area is incredibly loud). I ordered the filet medallion sliders with a side salad ($17). The meal comes with two pretzel bun sliders and the medallions are topped with horseradish sauce. The filet was perfectly tender and delightful but the sliders could have definitely used more sauce (I like when it burns). The side salad was just okay. Nothing to write home about. Service was friendly and prompt and everyone was satisfied with the experience."
"4.0","I had a sample of Cinderlands burger at a charity event and it was one of the best burgers ever! Could not wait to try this place out and we went for Sunday brunch last week.  Our waitress was fantastic and we quickly put in our orders.  I went with the egg breakfast sandwich which comes with cheese and both sausage and bacon on a Martins potatoes roll.  Served with a side of hash browns.  It was a ton of food and oh so much meat! Bring on the meat sweats! My only complaint was no greens in the dish- even a side of fruit would have been good to add a little more color to the dish.  The prices are reasonable and the service was quick.  Always can't wait to go back to try more of their beers which are fantastic and they have such a wide variety."
"4.0","Tram's might look like a dive, but don't let that deter you.  The food is tasty and comes in large portions at reasonable prices.  I came in on a Wednesday for a late lunch/early dinner, so it wasn't too busy.I had the Egg Rolls ($3.90 - They are $1.95 each, but you must order at least two.) and the Pho Hanoi Soup with beef ($8.95).  While the egg rolls were crispy and tasty, they really weren't anything special.  However, the pho was delicious!  A large portion (I had plenty left to take home for another meal!) of delicious, flavorful broth with good noodles and thinly sliced beef.  If you're in the Pittsburgh area and having a craving for pho, this is the place to go.This place is CASH ONLY so come prepared (or use the ATM at the door).  The service was pretty hands-off, but the staff was nice and friendly."
"5.0","We arrived at our hotel down the street, yelped sushi near our location, and Kiku popped up.  Perfect!  After realizing it was 2:45 pm and they close at 3 pm, we called in a to go order.  When we arrived to pick up our order, they offered to have us eat in even though they were supposed to close in 4 minutes. We ordered an appetizer also, curry calamari (VERY delicious!).  The rolls were perfect and fresh, friendly servers, nice atmosphere... Will definitely be back when we are in the area!"
"5.0","This little store, which sells Italian (Irish, and some other) decor and home-y things, ROCKS. Maria, the owner, also does cooking classes in the apartment upstairs. If I still lived in Pittsburgh, I'd LIVE there."
"5.0","Fantastic hot chicken joint in Oakland. The service is friendly and helpful. The menu is simple, which is nice. For the traditionalist, the chicken is served as tenders/planks - not on the bone. Alcohol is available for those who desire a nip with their meal. Another item of note; NO CASH - credit/debit cards only.  Atmosphere is very relaxed with a good amount of seating and TVs playing sports.  We tried the tenders, chicken-n-waffles and the salad which were all awesome. PS - the damn hot flavor lives up to its name!  Go to place for hot chicken when in the 'Burgh."
"4.0","What I like: the food is always good, I usually get the strawberry crepe cakes or the chorizo hash and literally the chorizo has is one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. I like how they have different sizes for juice. And I like how service is usually pretty fast and food comes out quick. Some constructive criticism: The checks never come with the total just an itemized list with individual prices and they're usually illegible. The other thing is I think the creams sit on the tables all day and it makes me not want to use it."
"4.0","Super fast service even at busy hours. Friendly staff. the bagels' content of cream cheese and baking may differ from time to time."
"5.0","The menu looks busy at first but is simple enough to easily understand the choices of ingredients. I went with the carnitas tacos with corn tortillas and no pico de gallo. I asked the waitress if my tacos could go light on the mexican slaw when a young chef cheerfully insisted that I should go with the usual amount since it's so good. And omg it was. The meat was a little dry in my opinion but the lime given along with the slaw added enough moisture to make up for it and the flavors were just mouthwatering. I ordered 2 tacos but I wish I had the stomach for more. They got nice music in my personal opinion.They use the electronic-tip choice for when you pay, which I'm not a huge fan of because that's before the experience so how will I know if the food and employees are above and beyond like this! Next time I'll leave a tip for sure!"
"3.0","Each time I've been here, it's been super busy. That's a good thing, right? Bloody Mary bar on Sunday is impressive, only $3 extra to upgrade to premium vodka which was nice. My quiche was good, but SO tiny."
"5.0","The seafood at this restaurant is truly second to none!!  I am impressed each and every visit! The Alaskan king crab is OUT OF THIS WORLD good.Our server, Drew, was undoubtedly the best waiter I have had thus far! His positive energy was radiating, which truly made our experience wonderful. Can't wait to come back!"
"5.0","Stop by on our way to the Strip District!!! If decor is what your looking for then don't stop here BUT if AMAZING food at a reasonable price....STOP ON IN!!! We had the Chicken Tikka Masala, Spinach Paneer and Lentil Soup!!!! DEEEEEE LISH US!"
"1.0","two parts to this review:1 - The food was very enjoyable and had good blends of spice and flavor.  I would not recommend the lamb slippers appetizer as they tasted more like greasy burgers than anything else.  The Lamb spinach massala and the chicken tikka massala were both very well made, however the portions were small and the price per dish was well above the norm.  The food alone would probably get around a 3.5 star (marks taken off for small portion and price).2 - The service could not have been worse, and completely ruined the experience for me and my wife.  It was around 10 minutes to have our order taken, with a further 20 until we received our apps.  When our entrees arrived they were both wrong (the wife received chicken instead of lamb, mine was a completely different dish altogether).  Upon sending them back we had to wait again after mine was brought out, then 10 minutes passed before my wife's replacement came out.The indian family at the table next to us experienced something similar, and upon telling the owner that the meal was incorrect, she actually told them that they were wrong, refused to change what was delivered, and refused to take it off their check.When our check arrived, it had 4 extra orders on it, we had the server take it back and change it and it took a further 2 trips to get this correct.The whole place was badly managed, the staff were polite but did not have a strong understanding of their roles and what was required of them.  The owner is rude and unwilling to take any sort of feedback.  The kitchen took too long with each order.With the other options for Indian food in Pittsburgh, I will never return to this restaurant, and recommend you not to waste your time either."
"5.0","Came here for lunch and after looking at there menu, which was hard to choose from, but I went with the fish and chips (about $7.50) and a side of coleslaw. This place is cash only so make sure you bring it. Loved that the crispiness of the fish and the fries were amazing. What I really loved about this place is that on the table they have oil, vinegar, tartar sauce, hot sauce and the fish came with cocktail sauce so you get to try a huge spectrum of taste with your fish. This is my kind of place, its reasonably priced, quick, a variety of condiments, great food, they have booze, if I am ever back in the Burgh I am stopping here."
"5.0","After weeks of telling my boyfriend I was craving Indian food, we finally visited Bangal Kabab. A friend of mine used to live in Oakland and we went here a couple times before, but it's been a while and I was excited to come back.If you're dining in, you receive an order of complimentary papad with 3 sauces. Papad is a thin, crispy almost chip-like food that you can use for dipping or eat by itself. We also started with an order of the garlic cheese naan, which I definitely have fond memories of from visits past. Their naan is always perfectly crispy, slightly charred just the way I like it, and tastes great.One of the first times I came here, I remember ordering the mango chicken and it being amazing. The mango chicken is in a curry-type sauce and is served with rice. It's not overly sweet, and you can definitely taste the mango in the sauce. Curry spice is a strong flavor, and sometimes it can be overpowering, but Bangal Kabab does an excellent job at seasoning just right. I decided on an order of mango chicken, my boyfriend got the lamb shank, and we got an order of bhindi masala. Okra is one of my favorite vegetables and it's not the easiest to find up north, so when I saw the bhindi masala which (lightly-fried okra with tomatoes and onions in sauce) I had to go for it.In total, our meal was a dollar or two over $40 for a ton of food and plenty of leftovers. We nearly 2 to-go boxes packed all the way full with leftovers for the next couple days! There was a 20% off special on Yelp, so always check for specials before paying. You never know! We loved all of our food, and we'll certainly be back. Bangal Kabab has been a high-quality spot as long as I've been going there, and I'd recommend it to anyone with the taste for good, authentic Indian food."
"2.0","Sat at the bar and got terrible service from rude bartenders who could have cared less to acknowledge or serve us. Nevertheless I left a good tip. No thank you, no goodbye no nothing . The food was good but I would never go back ."
"1.0","My boyfriend and I love crêpes and wanted to try out a new restaurant for brunch. We both regretted it right after we ordered. The waiter was extremely slow. We waited 25 minutes just for our cappuccinos. Finally, a warm wilted salad arrived for me and 'fruit plate' with a whole nectarine, a whole un peeled orange, and a stem full of grapes arrived for my boyfriend. Then we were served a tasteless crepe with overcooked chicken in it and a plain crepe with a few slices of banana and Nutella drizzled on it. The whole horrible experience took almost two hours. Absolutely will never come back!!"
"3.0","Sad to say I was disappointed. Station has a wonderful interior, but unfortunately the food is not as good.The three of us shared the corned beef tongue for our appetizer. This was good/not bad, just too much salt. For my entree, I ordered the pork tenderloin & pork belly. Not a good choice. The pork tenderloin tasted like plain supermarket ham and the one piece of pork belly I got had way too much fat in it that I practically swallowed half a mouthful of liquid fat. I struggled to eat even one piece of the 'pork tenderloin' and could not finish the rest. I also found the whole dish pretty salty.Although two out of three of us found a number of problems with our entree, we still took a leap of faith and ordered the lavender pound cake for dessert. It was weird. It had a bunch of clashing flavors--sweet, salty (actually, friend bit into a chunk of salt with the first bite she took...and was not happy), lemony--that I thought just didn't work well together. I was disappointed by the taste and quality of the food here, but the presentation of the food and beautiful ambiance bring the rating up a bit. Taste | 2Atmosphere | 4Presentation | 4Service | 3.5OVERALL | 3"
"4.0","I was walking around Lawrenceville with a friend on Easter Sunday and lots of places were closed. The ones that were open, were packed and the wait time was out of this world. So we were strolling around and came across B52, which surprisingly could seat us straight away.The place is quite small and cozy and they have lots of tables for 2. Our waiter was really nice and fun and explained the menu for us. We then decided to order a couple of things and share them between the two of us. For the drinks I ordered a normal coffee and a freshly squeezed orange juice. And for the food we had thick cut toast with almond spread and raspberry jam, the cashew cheese flat-bread and yogurt with compote.I do have to say, that charging $3.5 for a kids glass of OJ is a bit outrageous. I get it, it's organic, it's fresh etc, but really. The portion size was also rather on the small side for the price. The taste, however, was amazing and I did enjoy all the items that we have ordered. All in all, I did enjoy my experience at B52. You can taste, that all the items on the menu are being prepared freshly, which is the reason I can look over the price in the end. It's definitely 'different' and fresh, which is the reason I would definitely come back for another brunch/lunch."
"3.0","I must confess that I have only been here once, but it was a memorable experience. This is because the service was so great, and the food was so...not.The servers were friendly, made recommendations, and were prompt with their service.There are some vegetarian options, which is always nice to see. At the time they had a special appetizer of arancini (fried balls of risotto). I love arancini, so of course I ordered them, but what came out was not at all what I was expecting. They were dry, floury cakes that seemed like they never were risotto. It was very unpleasant.I looked at their menu just now and feel like I could be persuaded to try again, so stay tuned."
"5.0","I don't eat meat and they have the best veggie burgers in Pittsburgh. Their veggie burgers don't taste like cardboard. Everything has so much flavor!!!! I love this place!!!!"
"5.0","Cute, yet rustic, small Italian restaurant. Feels like you're walking in to someone's home for dinner. The food was amazing. We had the beans and greens to start and finished them in about 3 minutes. They were so good! We had the cod, filet, and gluten free penne and it was amazing! I highly recommend this restaurant. It's a total family feel and a great place to have an authentic Italian dinner."
"2.0","The food was really really salty + everything was on the heavier/oilier side. Even the salad...! If you're vegetarian or if you're looking for lighter dishes, I wouldn't recommend coming here."
"2.0","Sandwiches are small and expensive.  Ordered the 'Famous Special $8.99'  Definately not famous or special.  They say 'New York Style'.  Looks like they haven't been to New York during this century. In New York they are piled high and delicious. Don't believe me?  This place was completely dead during the lunch hour except for a couple old men sitting at the tables...  Eat somewhere else, seems like that's what everyone is doing"
"4.0","I've eaten here the last couple of days for breakfast. This is the first time I have eaten here since it opened, just because of their 9 to 3 hours (and I can't seem to get there on Saturdays), even though it is pretty much around the corner from where I live. The food was great, I had the egg white sandwich with avocado yesterday and the red beans and rice this morning. Both were absolutely great tasting. My girlfriend went with me yesterday and seemed to really enjoy her turkey sandwich. The only tiniest of caveats, the food took a while to get to me/us both days. More time than I might have expected. And second, the red beans and rice was advertised as coming with cornbread. Instead I got a lot of potato (a little pile of fingerling and a half a russet). After having gotten the plate, I asked one of the employees. She said they did not have the cornbread. Well, the person taking my order might have said something, the person (the same one I asked) setting the plate down might have said something and the red bean dish is on a white board, so the cornbread could have been excised easily from the board. But I am very impressed with the number of vegetarian, vegan and gluten free offerings."
"5.0","Super friendly people fun atmosphere and delicious food at a fair price.  New to PA and this is my favorite sandwich place."
"5.0","Amazing food.  CASH ONLY.  I always ALWAYS get the strawberry crepes and my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Perfect balance of sweet and savory, because it's filled with strawberries and like a cream cheese whipped cream and sprinkles of brown sugar...SO YUM.  Otherwise, basic coffee, sides of eggs, bacon, and sausage, etc.  But just go and get the crepes.  Just do it. I was going to give it 4 stars instead of 5 because there is ALWAYS a ridiculous wait during meal times.  You just have to expect that and set aside a whole morning or afternoon.  But I settled on 5 stars because, although it's a long wait to get a table, once you get one, the waiters are so fast and attentive, and my orders always come SUPER fast.  So in a way it kind of makes up for the wait.  [if you just hate waiting, you can also order for carry out; OH and another side-note, the crepes are EXCELLENT heated up in the oven later.  I'd usually eat half, take half home and eat the rest later]Anyway, whenever you're in Pittsburgh, go here!  I sure do."
"5.0","Just found this place! I loooooove love the feel of it. Art work on the old brick walls, friendly staff, happy people. I am in. Will be back soon. Who's comin' with me?"
"1.0","Don't bother wasting your time or money going here. My boyfriend and I have been to various Bucas with no problems at all. We had just finished coming from a tour with Molly Trolleys. We got seated in the area where the bar is at and waiter was nice. After placing our order which was a side order of spaghetti and fettuccine Alfredo with two meatballs,  we asked and decided to move to a different booth due to cold air ventilation. Our order came out fine and as we are eating I glanced up towards the bar and to my sighting I see what I thought to be a rat run across the floor. I took a double take as I couldn't believe it and raised my voice to my boyfriend in disgust to see what actually happened to be a mouse run under the original booth we were previously sitting at.I was so disgusted and my boyfriend and I were in shock that we stopped eating our food and didn't even finish our dinner. We stood up and told the guy at the bar if we can get our check. I quote my boyfriend told him dude I believe and think you have rats in your restaurant as we just saw one run across the floor. The bartender said and I quote ' no sir we don't have rats we only have mice'. My boyfriend and I looked at each other and at him to tell him we want our check and done. As we are standing and waiting, the bartender came and told us that the manager would come to see us. During our waiting period to get our bill and have the manager see us, guess what?!?! We see another mouse run across the floor. At this time we are totally disgusted and done and the guy who was our waiter came out to let us know our bill has been taken care of.My boyfriend and I are disgusted and hope not to get sick from eating here. We are also in shock that an employee  (bartender) would respond as if it's normal and ok they have mice. I believe this is a serious health issue and sanitation concern. I hope others read this review before considering eating at this disgusting and horrible establishment"
"3.0","The food was OK.  The staff was not very friendly.  Our waitress had an attitude.  I did not think the value was all that great.  I dis love all the photographs that were displayed wall to wall!  They were very fun to look at.  I have attached some photos of the photos.  However, as good as the photos are, they are not worth the time to eat here when there are better options.  Stop to use the restroom and take a quick look."
"5.0","Came to Cappy's for our work holiday party! Walked in and loved the intimate feel of the place. It's such a down home yinzer bar in Shadyside. Such a contrast to many of the places on Walnut street. It really feels like an authentic Pittsburgh place. The staff was very attentive and prompt. The drinks were really strong which is always a plus. Their perogies are really good! They had an entire spread for the party but I certainly like the stuffed one with cheese and onion the best. If you are looking for somewhere to chill with cheap drinks, and a casual atmosphere, hit up Cappys!"
"5.0","Absolutely fantastic.  We stopped in here on a Saturday because we were in town for another event  - since it's the Holiday Season, the pay lot up the street even had free parking.  Bonus!  Unfortunately, they didn't open until 5 PM, so we had to wait a couple minutes beforehand, but it was well worth it.  We were actually the first ones in the door.  I'm not going to talk about the ambiance/setting - others have pretty well covered this.  The kitchen was a little slow with our food, but the tableside service was still good.  I can't complain that much about the kitchen - as soon as we sat down, 5 other tables filled up right behind us.  While others got their appetizers and meals before us, we didn't mind because their food seemed a little less complicated to make, and I can understand the restaurant's approach of trying to make as many patrons happy as fast as they can.  But we did wait at least 30 minutes for our orders to come out (hence, the one star deduction).  Again - well worth the wait.  I had the Curry Goat; super flavorful; my only complaint is the amount of bones that came with it.  My dining partners had the Chicken Makhani (with tomato & cream sauce; it was delicious), and the Chicken Saag with spinach.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  The waiter came over and even asked if the spiciness was OK,...as if he could read our minds, especially since one of us experiences chronic indigestion.  She was fine throughout the meal and even after.  They were out of Naan bread, so they provided us a couple orders of other dipping bread, perfect to sop up all the leftover sauce.  They didn't push drinks on us; the water was fine and was refilled several times over.The big question:  would we go back?  Absolutely.  Even through we live about an hour away, we agreed we would drive that far just to come to this restaurant and try out more items."
"5.0","I love this place, I have been to this location (three times) as well as the one in Market Square in downtown Pittsburgh.Each time I enjoyed it. The prices are sort of high but it is worth it because the food is great. They have multiple food options such as an assortment of grilled cheese, burgers, flatbread sandwiches and salads. For the sides you can choose from a selection of different fries, tomato soup, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, a veggie of the day or fruit. They also have a big drink and beer selection. At this location I've had the crabby patty and the cheesy capresey, each time with the tomato soup and the sweet potato fries.  When you order the sweet potato fries, they come with a side of cinnamon butter to dip them in. I would highly recommend this place for lunch, a dinner get together, or a date. In the late morning to mid afternoon they also serve brunch. I have never been there for brunch but have heard that they are really good (plus they serve mimosas!)"
"5.0","Per usual, anywhere we visit I yelp restaurant reviews which is why we came, and this 'unique find' actually surpassed my expectations!! First contact was friendly parking advice on phone, (easy as could park anywhere on permit only street if for 1 hour as posted). Arrived to nice background music inside with decor that even my husband remarked on accented with brick and nice seating. I had a latte, my daughter a cappuccino, husband an americano coffee and we all thought each was delicious and frothy. The owner whose name I forgot to get was very accommodating; didn't hesitate when I asked for soy milk or when my daughter was undecided on what to order (trust me too many delicious sounding choices!) I had a really good omelet with Gouda, portobello mushroom and spinach, my husband also thoroughly enjoyed his Nutella with bananas on French toast and my daughter had Berries and cream on thick French toast. Yes, she took pictures of our food. Yes, the service was excellent. Yes, there was nothing I could improve upon. (I am sure I have never said this in a review) We cannot wait to come back to this delicious,  relaxing find, when my daughter moves up for grad school come August. Highly suggest you check it out. Btw, we are from Florida but I posted this while here..."
"5.0","Friday at 5pm my co-workers and I went on the recommendation of someone. We were just visiting the city for literally a hot minute. We were welcomed at the door and seated at a table in the back. We immediately loved the décor. Our waitress came over and offered us water right away and took our order for any drinks.  She returned in a timely manner with our drinks and took our order. I ordered the Pumpkin Ravioli. My friends each had a pasta dish, one with shrimp, one with meat. We read the Yelp reviews to be nosey. I can see what Judy means about space. It's very tiny. But don't let that our anything else in that review deter you from visiting here! Our food was the perfect temperature and I loved the Pumpkin Ravioli! It was the just the right amount (I believe 5 raviolis, maybe 6).. I'm not sure.. I was hungry and we were literally on time restraints for me to really keep track of details. My friends raved about their pasta dishes. We got our check and it was $62.. three different dishes, one soda. Maybe a tad pricey, but when the company is paying.. the price doesn't seem to bother you. As we left, a gentleman sitting by the door said 'Good night, Thank You' and was very friendly. My experience was a great one. It really is a cute little find and great options to choose from. I'd say GO! Definitely!"
"4.0","The atmosphere was nice.  They took a fairly small space and made it feel pretty big.  I like the name and their logo and the color scheme. Also, staff was super friendly...probably one of the nicest waitresses I ever had. The food was real good and filling and a good price. We had Brussels sprouts which were amazing and some perogies with parsnips, soured radicchio, and pickled mustard seed...a lot of flavor packed into these homemade dumplings.  I would have like a few more options but I'd rather see a limited menu with amazing food vs a large menu with bad food so all in all, good stuff.The beer was pretty good.  I'd give the beer a 7.5 out of 10.  They do a decent IPA...their double IPA is delicious but at 9.8%, a little too strong for me for a lunch.  Also have a coffee IPA that was good if your a coffee fan. Overall, another great addition to the Burgh's food scene and the beer was a great compliment to the meal so I'd definitely recommend."
"5.0","First time eating at an Hungarian restaurant and the food was stellar! While visiting for the weekend and staying close by, I saw the pictures folks have posted and my mouth was watering immediately. I started with sharing the fried cheese with rice and a sour creme sauce. The inside of the cheese wasn't hot, which I was hoping for, but the sauce and rice were fantastic. I wouldn't order it again, but I'm glad I tried it. The Chicken Paprikas blew my mind and my belt buckle 2 sizes. Hefty portion, aesthetically pleasing presentation, and overall delicious, not to mention the very reasonable price! Our server was sweet and so was the rest of the staff."
"5.0","My boyfriend and I were checking out the Strip,  when we peeped into Cafe Raymond and instantly knew we had to eat there. The atmosphere was so welcoming and the people were very friendly. We were recommended the Blueberry Ricotta Pancakes and the French Toast so that's exactly what we did!We were able to seat ourselves. It being somewhat crowded, we decided to sit outside, which is fine by me because who doesn't enjoy people watching? Haha anyway, we were served in about 15 minutes and I myself was taking back by how pretty the dishes looked. People walking by seemed to agree because our dishes were getting many stares and comments on how good they looked. Luckily for us, we were able to try let and OH MY GOD. I enjoyed my French Toast very much so but these Blueberry Ricotta Pancakes will change your mind about any other pancake you've ever had. Hands down my favorite Pancakes I've ever tried!"
"3.0","We randomly came to this place with the intent of having couple of tacos but we ended up having an early dinner here since the tacos were so tasty. The place is pretty small so come here early to ensure that you don't have to wait too long!"
"2.0","I used to love this place but last three orders have been horrible. I ordered string beans and chicken extra spicy. No spice and it was 90% string beans. As usual I asked for extra homemade hot mustard and needed nothing els and I get the whole bunch of condiments and just a tad of mustard. I used to think they were the best and sadly they continue to disappoint"
"4.0","I won't pretend that Little Nippers is crazy gourmet or anything, but it doesn't try to be. I eat here once a week and it's consistently good food. A great Pittsburgh establishment with friendly staff.I recommend the pastas -- baked ziti or mediterranean in particular --  and the artichoke hoagies."
"2.0","We stopped in for a quick bite before the maroon 5 concert. Very little parking. This place consists of 5 tables and a bar because of this the place is always packed. We were lucky to have found 2 seats at the bar. The bartender was frazzled and running around it took him awhile to take our drink order. I ordered classic fish in chips . The fries were very good the fish was kinda greasy but the potion was perfect. This place is a pittsburgh legend u gotta stop in."
"5.0","Wife, son, daughter and I went to Ruth Christ to celebrate by sons graduation.The service was absolutely outstanding.Waiter came right over and introduced themselves and took drink orders and gave us menus.Drinks came right away and waiter took order immediately.Ruths Chriss was on the crowded side that night but, There was no issues with service at all.I ordered a porterhouse for two to share with my daughter cooked medium rare.We also ordered sides of mashed potatoes and spinach.The bread was delicious and I had a mozzarella and tomato salad which was also really good.The porterhouse was cooked perfectly.The porterhouse was ok better than other places but not the best I have ever had.It was definitely good, But I think I would have the filet Mignon the next time.The place is really nicely laid out and the staff is truly amazing.The food overall was really good, But the service was beyond great.I would go back just for the service alone.Ruth Chris is definitely on the expensive side so expect a pricey meal.The price is defiantly worth it if you want fantastic service and great food.I will definitely go there again."
"5.0","Stopped in for a quick dinner before the pens game, amazing sandwiches with DUCKFAT FRIES they are amazing. Potato salad that will remind you of old school picnics!"
"5.0","Fantastic! Authentic, succulent food, delightful atmosphere and staff are a realpleasure. It's a small space, quaint and charming, you sit at the counter and watch the chef prepare the food, and they also do a robust takeout business. My teenage daughter and I shared three tacos, but should have followed the owner's recommendation that we get two each. The carnitas were perfection, the other two tacos - outstanding. Very affordable, great place to have lunch in the South Side!"
"4.0","First, I hadn't realize Cafe Raymond had moved a few blocks. That through me for a loop! Anyway, I had been to the old location no less than 100x for lunch over the years - would recommend lox salad and any soup. But this review is for their brunch, which I hadn't realize Cafe Raymond had. A quick search on Yelp for breakfast places and I just had to go. I met a friend here and she was a few minutes ahead of me. She was able to grab a table and hot tea, no issues. Once I arrived, we placed our order at the counter then reclaimed our table. We were there a few minutes after 10am on a Sunday, which was perfect timing. As we sat waiting for our food, a huge line formed. It seems like people eat and leave pretty quickly though, so I can't imagine waiting for a table would take long. The ordering process is streamlined and they use a number system to locate you when your food is ready. We both ended up ordering the same thing, which was surprising with so many good choices on the menu -- sausage, egg and cheese croissant. I was pleasantly surprised when it showed up with a side of potatoes. For ~$9, you can't beat it. The croissant was comprised of fluffy goodness and the egg arrived piping hot. There's a self-serve water station, which I always appreciate.All of the staff I encountered were pleasant and it was a very successful start to my Sunday. Thanks, Cafe Raymond!"
"2.0","Why don't you accept debit cards??  Used cash last month, food was decent. Nothing special. Went recently and was about to check out. Tried to use my debit card and was told 'cash only'. Is this 1980??  Almost everyone uses debit cards now. I can't imagine the business that's being turned away. Never again!"
"5.0","I absolutely love it here. I live in the area and walk over at least once every two weeks. The store itself is extremely cozy. It gives off a rustic vibe due to the fact that it has a wooden countertop, wooden floors, and wooden tables & chairs as well. The staff is always friendly and more than willing to help. They are reasonably priced - and I love supporting a local business. Now on to the teas - I love the cold teas here and have tried the Yerba Redhead, the EoJito, and the Peach Apple Cobbler. They all have real pieces of fruit in them - lemons, limes, raspberries, and/or peaches, and I love them all. The food is fantastic as well, they have many sandwiches, salads, and smoothies! I always get the EO Beef and it's amazing every time. I would highly recommend checking this place out if you are in the area and want to try it!"
"5.0","This is a great place to grab a quick bite to eat. The place doubles as a bar up at the front and a unique sit down family restaurant towed the back. As far as the bar goes, the drinks are super cheap, and they have 40s to go at the cheapest price on Carson St. The bartenders are always friendly, and ready to mix up your next favorite drink.The food like is super good, known for their deep fried fish sandwiches, all of it is home made. I personally love their clubs and Reuben sandwiches. The place always has great food specials, and the family owned staff is always super friendly and ready to serve. The food is also super cheap compared to other bars in the South Side. They could definitely up their prices 20% and still be reasonable. Only negative thing I would say about this place is it needs updated a little. Lose the old paintings on the wall. Haha"
"5.0","It's a little pricey but the food was great. I enjoyed my seafood pasta and the apple tart was definitely worth the order. I sampled all of my friends food and it was equally delicious. The vibe is real uptown  sheek if you get my drift but the music is Mello and chilled. Definitely a good look for a date."
"5.0","My husband and I just moved here and he passes this place everyday on his way home from work. So tonight we decided to have a pizza and baseball night. Omg it was the best pizza we have had here in Pittsburgh. We've tried all the 'best/top' places and omg Rialto's was incredible. Highly recommended!!!  Coming from An Italian !"
"3.0","I'd give a higher rating except for the exceptionally bad device from the hostess. I was in Pittsburgh with my son's basketball team attending a tournament. We called ahead to tell them we had 14 people coming, they said they'd put us on the list. When we arrived we waited 45 minutes for our table. During that time the hostess twice acted as if she had never seen us before. After we finally asked to speak with a manager we were shown to our table which had been unoccupied the entire 45 minutes we were there. After that things were decidedly better. Our server was very attentive. Service was fairly quick and accurate. The food was good - I had the ahi tacos which had a generous amount of tuna and a decent amount of kick. Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals. My son said the pork chops were good and he and his teammates liked their nachos and wings appetizers. The beer selection was very good and the waitress was knowledgeable about the choices. Prices were a little high but not crazy. We had a good amount of food and drinks for what we paid. Overall a good experience once we were finally seated. Why we couldn't be seated right away remains a mystery."
"4.0","Stopped in here with the man while walking our dog down Carson the other day.  Loved the casual vibe - walk in, grab taco, bounce.  Since we were literally just walking by, we got the spicy beef taco.  Loved the corn tortilla option, nice balance of flavor, good quality.  I definitely will go back and try some of the other options.  I would love to see a shredded beef option :)Were they the best street-ish tacos I've had in Pittsburgh?  No - that will go to Las Palmas or Reynas.  But they are still really good and definitely the best in Southside!"
"4.0","We just finished the Cajun breaded white fish it was delicious wife had French fries I had fried oysters they where great. but we wanted fried cod and she wanted calamari but they where out of both second time I have been here and where out of signature items that being said both times the item I settled for was delicious. and just in case you have not read the other reviews it's cash only. good place but not in my top favorites. but when it comes to the fish sandwich it comes in second plus reasonable prices.  Not a destination stop but a great second choice."

"1.0","As with all chains, I prefer to review this Buca compared to other locations and have that weigh heavily on the rating.The service here is slow. When I walked through the kitchen they seemed very confused and disorganized. The carpets are old, worn, and dirty. Restrooms are not terribly clean, and in need of a major update. The food is OK - cookie cutter to all Bucas.  Reasonably good. Too bad it took an hour for food to show up. 'Only if you have to.'"
"1.0","Establishment was absolutely filthy. Service was awful. The location appeared to have plenty of employees but management appeared content to let them do nothing versus maintaining the store."
"5.0","Delicious food! I am a fan of all of their appetizers. My favorite is Baba Ganoush, which we sort of accidentally ordered (the waiter misheard us), but it was a fortunate mistake! It really has a great smokey flavor, much more so than others I have a tried.I also never had cashew cheese before coming here. I'm not sure it could really replace cheese for me, but it's definitely good as it's own dish.All of their dishes carefully flavored, a wonderful balance of spice, and the pita is soft and warm! You really can't go wrong"
"5.0","This bakery is such a gem! My daughter and I were in town to see a show and stopped to get coffee this morning. I got the almond croissant and a dozen of their little choux to go. The choux was perfect! Not too sweet, bite sized, and perhaps too easy to eat. The almond croissant does look a little flat, like others have said. But the flavor! And the denser, slightly chewy texture! It's a must try! This was our first time in Pittsburgh, and I seriously regret not buying at least a dozen of them. The staff was super nice, too!"
"5.0","The Yard makes Monday a no-brainer to eat out!  Let's start with the happy hour 1/2 off apps - Pub Pretzels, Prosciutto Wrapped Shrimp, and Pound O' Wings (oh my!) are money.  The best are (apparently were) the mussels - please put them back on the menu!  But wait...there's more!  Can you say 1/2 off grilled cheese sammies + $4 local pints 7pm-midnight?  There's an abundance of options for whatever mood you're in and a new flavor combo seems to appear on the menu w/ some regularity.  Chips come standard, but consider upgrading to fries and dip 'em in the smoked tomato soup.  One caveat, however...rock a base layer + parka because it's like dining in a walk-in freezer (and no, it's not the fans' fault)!"
"5.0","OK, it's probably premature to give this truck five stars, but it's all I have to go on... The jalapeño popper sandwich? Probably the best sandwich I've ever had in my life. It was so so so good.Honestly I should probably subtract a star just because I can't find a picture of their menu board that has the jalapeño popper sandwich actually on it.That's all I've had. And that's all I have to go on. If you like jalapeño poppers, and you like spicy food,  and you like sandwiches then you should go to this truck and eat this sandwich. And if they don't offer it when they visit your venue? Then you should raise your voice and point and gesticulate and be outraged and question their intelligence for not making this a regular menu item."
"3.0","LOUD - sitting at a circle booth I couldn't carry on a conversation with other people at the table.Reservations - highly recommend - the place was packedI ordered a house salad and salmon ... and specifically said I would like the salad first.  It was delivered first, and before I took a bite, our meals were delivered.All 7 dinner meals were on large plates and the table wasn't big enough.We had flat bread pizza, sliders, chicken fingers, thick sliced bacon cheese burgers, and my salmon.  The bacon was impressive.  The salmon over pureed butternut squash, asparagus, tomatoes, and onions was perfectly cooked.The adults all enjoyed their meals.  The flat bread pizza was too crisp for the young audience.I saw a private dining room and roped off area  - Christmas party? City restaurant = city parking ($20 x 2 cars) Would I go back?   Yes. Bring kids? No definitely adult restaurant"
"3.0","Hip, but the ramen is nothing special. The pig ears were kind of good. The cucumber app was Oaky. Best thing I tried was the eggplant appetizer (it's cold), I thought it was delicious. I might be back if all my friends pressure me into it, but I won't be thrilled. At least it's not expensive."
"3.0","This restaurant has a lot of space with tables, seats, and booths if you want to hang out with some friends for a while. The cashier was very nice in her conversation. My order was prepared very fast. I enjoyed the taste of my broccoli cheddar soup and baguette. The bacon in my BLT roasted turkey avocado sandwich was soggy and not as good as I have eaten at other locations of Panera."
"3.0","This place is probably good as a restaurant, but not the best coffee shop type atmosphere if you're looking to hang out and drink coffee or get some work done. The music is really loud and they want to seat you rather than just letting folks set up at a table. That being said, I got their vanilla flavored latte special and it was delicious...almost $6...but delicious. I will give this place another chance for a meal, but will probably go elsewhere when I want t hang out at a coffee shop."
"5.0","This pizza is amazing. I cannot speak for the authenticity and all of that, but good pizza is good pizza. The deep dish is what you need to get. I can't even eat a small in one sitting and I am a pretty big eater.The inside of the place is a dive. You can eat in but it's got the feel of a take out place mostly, for instance, you have to get your soda at a pop machine inside. But yeah, the pizza is quite phenomenal. If you get the deep dish. DOWN SIZE. It will fill you up fast."
"5.0","Takoyaki. Sunomono. Okonomiyaki.If you think you'd enjoy saying those, just imagine tasting them.The menu here is a masterpiece; well rounded, inventive, and adventurous. You are encouraged to order bit by bit and try several small plates, and this is a great place to bring friends who don't have cooties to split and share your food.I went with a friend, and we sampled many wonderful things. The highlights were definitely the Nasu Shigayaki (pan fried eggplant topped with flavorful ground chicken) and the Takoyaki (essentially octopus hush-puppies).I love unagi, and it was on special when we went. It was prepared like a disassembled unagi sushi roll, with the roasted eel, nori, and rice in patty form laid out artfully on the plate.The cocktails were pure fun, with names like Godzilla Tears, Panda Panda Panda, and my favorite: Fizzy Lifting Drink! (the Willy Wonka reference works, since this place is to Japanese food what Willy Wonka's Factory is to Chocolate.)Please, if you like Japanese food or are an adventurous eater, try Umami."
"5.0","These are some of the best subs around. My other choice would be Uncle Sam's, though these two businesses have different locations in the city so the competition isn't as direct. I thought that the Roethlis'burger' was worth 5 stars in its own right, just because it's so interesting. The egg adds a lot of flavor and the meat is very tender. The 'ultra' cheese steak is more standard, and that's pretty comparable with other places like Uncle Sam's. No free fries here, but the subs are so big that we didn't need them at all."
"5.0","Went for Saturday brunch, price for brunch was a bit high in my opinion for the portions we received. What lacked in size, was made up for in taste. The donuts we grabbed on the way out, for later; were some of the best vegan donuts I've had."
"1.0","With Panera and Dunkin down the road, Pamela's across the street, and Red Oak and Starbucks up a block, there is almost no reason to visit this location.  They are THE slowest...go in for a bagel, and you will leave ten minutes later...without the bagel and frustrated because they are the slowest group of individuals I have ever encountered.  Post Office slow...yes, that bad.  The workers are rude also.  You would think if it took 15 minutes to make a simple salad (which was not very good and quite small for the price), you would get a sorry for the wait, but nothing....This Breugger's needs to go....or the management."
"5.0","Great Chinese street food. You can choose raw food items and pay by weight, and they can make it a spicy and hot wok （麻辣香锅） or spicy and hot soup （麻辣烫）. Both of them are really good!"
"4.0","My husband took me to Coca Cafe for brunch one late Sunday morning. The wait didn't take too long, and we were seated within 15 minutes. Sadly we came after the brunch rush, and a few options that my husband wanted had run out. I was still able to get what I want - the fried eggplant benedict - though.I am not that big a fan of eggplant, but from reading my fellow yelpers' reviews, I had to check it out! And I was not disappointed. This was absolutely delicious, never would I have thought eggplant could taste this good, and the sauce, oh my, I could dip anything in the basil hollandaise and eat it. My husband had the braised short ribs with lakes and brussel sprouts which he enjoyed as well."
"5.0","Hands down the best and most exciting new restaurant in Pittsburgh.  I was able to make my first visit here this past Friday for dinner after hearing nothing but good things about it.  Celebrating a birthday party for a family friend, I was able to sample a variety of items off of the menu.  For appetizers, the calamari, mussels, and stuffed portobello mushrooms were outstanding.  Rather than being fried, the calamari was sautéed and served with a pesto sauce along with other vegetables.  The mussels were cooked to perfection in a tomato based broth, and I must admit that they were by far better than Point Brugge Cafe's signature dish.  The mushrooms were stuffed with quinoa and paired with cherry tomatoes that provided excellent contrasts in both taste and texture to the meaty mushrooms.  For main courses, I was lucky enough to taste the ricotta gnocchi with lamb ragout, the daily risotto with chicken and other vegetables, along with the seared scallops.  Of all the risotto was the most outstanding, but all of the dishes were equally tasty.  It was very hard selecting an entrée since all sounded delicious.  Desert was equally amazing with tastings of a macadamia nut bread pudding and an apple cider creme brulee.  Sausilido is easily one of the best places in the city offering innovative cuisine at reasonable prices.  I will be looking forward to many more excellent meals here."
"3.0","My boyfriend and I wanted to try somewhere new today, so we found Genoa Pizza on Uber Eats. We ordered a larger extra cheese pizza, some bacon cheese fries, and I ordered some fettuccine Alfredo. Delivery was pretty speedy, but the food was just okay. The pizza was very good, my boyfriend even agrees. But the cheese fries could have been cheesier, and my alfredo was lacking a lot of elements. The Alfredo sauce wasn't cheesy, could have used garlic and a few other spices. The piece of garlic bread it came with became soggy from sitting in aluminum foil. Overall I enjoyed it, but there's room for improvement."
"5.0","Great food, and amazing customer service. I order for delivery all the time and it always comes on time and fast. No matter of the weather. The drivers are also very friendly. I highly suggest that everyone would order from here, they are the best in pittsburgh. Even if you have dine in, it is very cozy and very friendly surrounding. You can not find any place better than Gennaros pizza. And they serve alcohol!!!!"
"3.0","Where do I begin? I had very high hopes for this place. The bar area is solid $ the food is good. Where they fall short is on the overall dining experience. I am from Barcelona and was looking for a comparable experience. Tapas aren't supposed to be rushed. Our server kept insisting that we order all our picks at once. That's not how it works. You order two or three, taste enjoy and talk. Then you decide on what to order next. Drinks while you wait with more conversation. Repeat. This place made me feel rushed and obvious turn table strategy. We moved to the bar and had a much more enjoyable experience. We should have eaten at the bar. Maybe next time?"
"5.0","I was originally drawn to this place because of convenience , and the fact that I'd much rather support a local, independently owned business. I only frequented Starbucks because I truly LIKED  their coffee, but I don't usually support any corporate businesses. I was so pleasantly surprised by this place! They've done a fantastic job of making it homey, warm and inviting. It's updated and cozy without being at all pretentious. Their coffee is nothing short of amazing. Strong and flavorful, but only because that's what I LIKE. The staff is so attentive that I only had to order once before the dark, longer haired gentleman ( sorry his name escapes me right now, which is awful because he always waits on me and is so friendly) had my preferences memorized. It's worth it to ask about their menu because they'll make whatever you like, however you like it. As a vegan, I was also so impressed to know they  offer many organic, all natural selections as well. I love that they serve fresh pressed juices,too. This is popular in other states because of the health benefits, but not so much in the burgh. They're perfectly sized and convenient and are a great natural substitute to coffee. Juices can provide more energy than caffeine, and I'm glad they realize that. I really have nothing negative to say, here! This establishment is clean, inviting, has fabulous employees, and offers great products all over the board. It's refreshing to leave an establishment with a smile on your face and eager to devour whatever delicious concoction they've made for you. Keep up the good work, Delanies. You'll continue to see me on a daily basis! And your staff ALL deserve gold stars."
"2.0","Stopped in here for a small bite and drinks... not great. We decided on their Bloody Mary from the cocktail menu... it was super generic and no flavor other than the absurd amount of spice. It was so spicy that I could only take two drinks. I'm not one to return something because I didn't like it, but the bartender could have at least asked why I didn't drink it  We ordered the pierogies for our snack... again, no flavor!"
"5.0","My second visit to Cafe Raymond was just as wonderful as our first.  The food is fresh and delicious.  The staff, friendly and attentive.  I had salad on both visits, this time, my son had a burger.  The burger was enough for two people.  I wish they were open for the dinner hour."
"4.0","not quite at the level of dormont dogs or station street but a decent hot dog menu with a bunch of good beers/hard ciders in the coolers .  nice sit-down seating.  parking is dodgy as it is in most of mt. worst-ing-ton .  worth an occasional trip .  good hangover hot dogs."
"2.0","This place seems favored by many people because of its fresh and healthy food. But I really has no feeling for it... The salads have nothing special; the amount of the Phipps Special I ordered is just as much as appetizer in other cafe or so, and taste really bad...(I can't remember the name); the fruit cup is very small and thus pricy. I expected there will be juice in this healthy place, but nope..they gave me soda...the only thing seems ok is the pizza my friend order...Well"
"2.0","The staff is exceptional!  That's where my positive review ends. The food is just, well, meh. Unremarkable burger, which was disappointing. The potato soup is pretty good."
"4.0","Great food. Nice place and a couple decent drafts on tap. Really it's all about the food but the atmosphere is fun and the bar is nice and long. Looks like a lot of attention to the details and the food really is worth it. Tapioca is great, and sandwiches are terrific."
"3.0","Setting was nice near waterfront with many seating options and our server was awesome, friendly, upbeat, and informed. But the food was just Ok, decent, nothing too exciting (had the big house salad with steak and blue cheese dressing) and the sweet potato fries which were undercooked. Restaurant interior needs some repairs and refreshing, looks pretty beat up with torn seats, missing trim on baseboard trim, and such (in the back area that we saw)."
"5.0","Large cheese pizza $6.00 plus AWESOME! Pizza is actually very good and can't beat the deal. Will definitely be going there every time I'm in Pittsburgh."
"1.0","Serves cold sandwiches!! Horrible service!! I asked to have my sandwich heated up and they said they could not do it!! Shouldn't be able to serve food that can't be heated!! Health code violations everyhwere!!"
"2.0","For some reason, every time that I go to this Panera, something annoys me! I am quite the Panera lover, too, and this is the only restaurant of probably 20-30 locations that I have been to that has consistently not met my expectations. The annoyance starts as I walk into the door. I stand behind the roped off line every time I'm there trying to decide what I want. However, this is the only location where I'm asked 5 times while standing there if I need help. I'm sorry, but I understand how a line works and will make my way into the line when I'm done staring at the menu! In the past, I had a simple bagel and cream cheese order confused. More recently, I've been disappointed by some part of my meal every time I'm there. The last two times that I've been to this restaurant, my issue was the french baguette. Their baguettes are cut very inconsistently and are often very thin and flat. The You Pick 2 sandwiches are also unusually tiny.The best part of the restaurant is how huge it is! It's at least twice as large as a normal Panera and looks like it's a popular spot for college students to study and take a break."
"5.0","Delicious! The tapas were portioned well for our party of four. The server guided us through the menu perfectly with great recommendations. With it being my first time in Pittsburgh and all the great choices I had for dinner, I'm glad our hosts picked Morcilla. It holds up to expectation. My favorite dish was, surprisingly, the brussel sprouts with smoked goat cheese. We also got the All the Meats. The sabrasado was absolutely delectable. Highly recommend"
"4.0","Service was a little slow but we also got there kind of early for dinner. The ramen was really good. I ordered extra noodles with mine and it was perfect."
"4.0","We love this place. I have never had a bad meal here. The staff is pleasant and attentive. The food is great and the prices are reasonable. Convenient to both sports venues and Stage AE. Highly recommend."
"3.0","CoCa  is fine, but certainly doesn't live up to the hype.  Everything about this place was just 'ok.' By far not one of the best brunches around.The first and most important tip: download the Nowait app and use it.  You will absolutely have to wait at least 40 minutes to be seated and it is not a good situation if you are already hungry- this place WILL make you hangry. And trust me - the wait isn't worth it.Service was ok- yes they were a little slow but the place was packed so it wasn't anything that I found unreasonable.The food was also just ok (anyone noticing a theme?!) it wasn't the rainbow unicorn exploding experience I thought would surely happen given the wait to get in. I had the goat sheesh stuffed French toast- which was unique at least.Bottom line- if you have free time on a Sunday and you plan a little in advance, this place is a decent brunch but not worth starving yourself for."
"5.0","We went for breakfast only.  The food was fantastic.  Broccoli and cheddar omelette was exceptional and well prepared. Italian toast was fresh and delicious and warm when served.  My wife's corn beef hash was also excellent as was the bacon.  Made to order and delicious.  They also used real butter and cream for the coffee.  The servers were all clean, friendly, and had no visible tattoos which we appreciate in this day and age!  Excellent.  We rarely take the time to post a review."
"3.0","A clean, second story Mexican restaurant overlooking Market Square. Convenient location for a quick downtown working business lunch, although the service almost seemed too fast and once we paid our server she didn't bother to come back even though I needed a box for my leftovers. I chose two beef soft tortilla tacos and my coworkers chose a vegetarian burrito and enchiladas respectively. We started off with the queso dip which was delicious with tortilla chips that were a very nice consistency with sea salt. The meals were served with the expected refried beans and rice. Meals lacked flavor and were not the best Mexican I've had, but would come back again and like to try some other menu options and perhaps some cocktails!"
"4.0","This has to be one of the best restaurant around for chinese food or maybe I'm just a little biased.  During weekends, the next room holds a live karaoke and that's where I fell in love with this place.  The food is just as good!  I normally order the scallion pancakes, the hot won ton soup and chinese spinach and it's always tasted so good.. my mouth is watering just thinking about it.. highly recomended place for sure!"
"2.0","When asked to meet friends before a concert to have dinner I thought I would give it another chance.... should of saved my money.  I love beer battered fish so I ordered their beer battered fish dinner.  The batter was heavy and over loaded, way more batter than fish, very thick, not light like it should be, bake potato was hard not baked long enough or maybe they nuke it vs baking it, mixed veggies where right out of the freezer bag steamed. Long John Silvers does fish better.... The server was ok not great ... kept calling everyone 'honey' someone should be teaching them that is in very poor taste."
"3.0","Went here for lunch today and it was good! I got a cheese steak with fries and drink. It's was pretty standard fries were kind of bland. I liked the cheesesteak tho! May be returning!"
"1.0","Wonton soup tastes gross like they never change the soup in the pot. There's nothing inside the wonton. Worst wonton I have ever eaten. Sweet and sour chicken is wayyyyy too sweet to me. Yuk."
"5.0","This cozy gem embodies all the things I miss about this part of the US! Good Italian wine, fresh soup and breads, delicious calorie Laden Italian dishes, and a quintessential  owner who loves to fraternize with his guests and tell stories comparing women and men to wine. What more do you need in life really? Italian wedding soup was my favorite item there. I got the linguine with clams which was pretty fresh and  not lacking in clams to pasta ratio!Nice place to spend a Saturday afternoon chowing down and drinking Peronis."
"1.0","ridiculously over priced. spent $12 on two double espressos. the girl working didn't know the difference between chai and latte. would never recommend as a cafe."
"3.0","Friendly waiters, nice vibe, but food and drinks are not good enough for me to come again."
"4.0","The waitress was very friendly and from out of town. Unfortunately I was not paying much attention to her dialogue so did not catch her name. I was thinking more about work. Dinner was soup and salad for opening and then chicken fettucine. The salad was ample size and deliciously tasty. The soup on the otherhand was fantastic in flavor. The rizo and spicy Italian sausage was exactly what the soul needed on this cold fall evening. The waitress waited until I was completely finished with my soup and salad before bringing out the entree. Nice. The chicken fettucine was hugh and was good but nothing outstanding.The one thing I did not get was the bread. What happened? I decided to give the place one more visit before I left Pittsburgh but unfortunately I never had the chance...maybe the next trip."
"1.0","Lou NY We were visiting our niece who made a reservation for 7 for 6.30 pm at the 'best Italian restaurant'.  We arrived early  at 6.25 and were standing behind a party of 6 who DID NOT have a reservation.  The owner Mr Girasole sat the party in front of us at our table set for 7.  When my niece spoke up and said,  'that's our table', he completely ignored her and sat them down instead.  He did not even offer an apology or try to make it right in any way.  He just said we had to wait. Well needless to say, we did not wait. We went a block away to The Yard and had a fantastic meal without having to wait for a table, and they were packed.   They say NY is a rude city.  We NEVER experienced anything like that in our lives.  We will never attempt to go back to Girasole and our niece will spread the word and will never recommend that place again!That one star is only because we don't have the choice of negative stars!! And can't post this review unless we chose something."
"5.0","Our favorite sushi place in Pittsburgh. And their special cocktails come with a really fun souvenir cup! Haha. The location and parking is not great, but it has been there for like 30+ years. Definitely worth checking out!!! And it's quiet on a weeknight-perfect for a date!"
"3.0","The pizza here is slightly better than average,  but the subs and salads are the best in this section of the city. The steak salad is pretty good.  Lots of fresh greens, tomatoes and a big pile of fresh pizza mozzarella.   Their homemade ranch dressing tops it off well.   This is a negative for me,  but the steak is more of a jiffy steak.   Some folks love it,  but I prefer a real steak,  rare. The subs and burgers definitely beat my expectations for a corner pizza joint.  The burgers are large and definitely a good quality,  if not handmade.  The Buffalo chicken sandwich is AWESOME, with their yummy Buffalo 'fries'  on top.   I get it with their ranch on top. I wouldn't go out of my way to get there,  but definitely worth a try if you work downtown."
"2.0","If you grew up in a part of the country with lots of Vietnamese food or have eaten it in such places, you're not going to be impressed by Tram's.I gave this place two tries and was disappointed both times. I will admit that I only tried the pho and a vermicelli bowl (on separate trips), but having ordered anything else on each of my trips would have put my bill in the neighborhood of $12+. Having grown up with cheap Vietnamese food in Texas, I wasn't prepared to spend that much for what's supposed to be a budget lunch, even with the understanding that I was going to leave hungry and that the lack of non-European ethnic diversity in Pittsburgh is going to automatically make things more expensive.Either way, I don't understand the hype surrounding this place. The pho bowl was small, with a tasteless broth and child-sized portions of noodles and meat. After a few bites, I drenched the whole thing in Sriracha just to give it some flavor and to try to trick my stomach into feeling a bit more like I had eaten something.The vermicelli was not so great either--a small portion of vegetables and noodles with a few too-thick chunks of pork that were not grilled long enough for any sort of darkness or crisp (but which still managed to be dry). The color of the dish was as bland as the taste.As for the atmosphere, not a big deal for me. The restaurant is small, with minimal seating and some dinginess to it, but that's fairly common for older Vietnamese restaurants. Most diners are young, hip, and not Asian (which could be a turn-off for some due to the perceived lack of authenticity and/or hipsteriness). Parking is a chore; if you live nearby and choose to give the place a try, walk or ride your bike, or prepare to find yourself circling nearby blocks of permit-only parking.Folks who dine at Tram's should keep in mind that cheaper, better, more authentic Vietnamese food exists out there. I grew up in North Texas (Dallas-Fort Worth area), where with one of the largest Vietnamese populations in the country, good, cheap Vietnamese food can be found all over the metro area. Pho portions down there are reasonably big, there are plenty of different meat combinations, and you can almost always choose the size of the bowl you want (usually kid's, small, large, and extra-large). Additionally, due to the presence of plenty of fresh ingredient suppliers and competition, prices are more in line with portion size, and the food is, more often than not, good. Most folks with normal appetites are able to leave satisfied having spent no more than $7 or $8 a person with tax and tip (compared to $20 at Tram's). Out of all the Vietnamese spots in North Texas that I've tried, my absolute favorite is Pho Pasteur, in Arlington: The pho, vermicelli bowls, crushed rice dishes, spring and egg rolls, and prices are all excellent. Tram's would be put out of business if anyone ever opened a restaurant like that up here.If none of the other few choices in Pittsburgh are satisfying your Vietnamese food cravings, it might be worth it to take a weekend trip up to Toronto. You would also have access there to some other Asian foods that we don't have here, such as dim sum and Taiwanese 'small eats.' For a slightly shorter drive, you can also find these things (though more sparsely) in the D.C. suburbs."
"4.0","My boyfriend and I dined here for brunch this past Saturday around 1pm and had a very enjoyable experience. We called ahead and were told the wait was 45 minutes, but before we even arrived and parked- after 30 minutes- we were called and told our table was ready. We were seated as soon as we arrived at a corner table in the back. Waters were brought out immediately, much appreciated since it was a blazing hot day! Being it was hot- what did we both order? Hot coffee :) which was quite refreshing actually since we were in the cool back room. I went with the smoked salmon omelette with dill, chives, goat cheese, and tomatoes. I chose the potatoes over the toast. The omelette was amazing! The creaminess of the goat cheese paired perfectly with the smoky flavor of the salmon. I absolutely loved the addition of the dill and chives too. The potatoes were nothing special to write home about. The boy had the four cheese omelette- cheddar, Gouda, goat cheese, and American. He chose the rye toast with his. He said the  omelette was fluffy, cheesy goodness! Service was pretty good- I wish the coffee flowed a little more often than it did but when we could flag down the server we did get our refills. They have a ton of interesting sounding menu options - various other omlettes and Brie stuffed French toast in particular- that I'd love to go back and try in the future!"
"1.0","At best very average. Duck tasted as if had been drenched in soy , horribly salty and far over cooked. Scallop risotto was a bland mush concoction with diced pieces of scallops. The person served this ate about 10% of the plate . Crab cakes were thought ok. Appetizers were a bit better . Cheesecake was shared by 4 people and 2/3 wasn't eaten. Service was nice  and prices were reasonable . Overall no one in our party enjoyed the place and can't recommend it."
"4.0","Tried the bread pudding and it was the best chocolate bread pudding I hav had so far..taking away a star cos service was kinda slow but food was awesome!"
"4.0","I have never had anything other than their dosas. They are pretty good with a hefty portion of the potato filling and the sauces (sambar and chutney). I do like the dosas at Udipi better, but Tamarid is about a mile away from me, so I would sacrifice a bit of quality in exchange of a 20 mile round trip drive. I have, however, tried my friend's butter chicken. It was pretty darn good! It was nothing like the common creamy butter chicken that you see if EVERY north-Indian restaurant. This one had more of a chicken curry consistency, but it was oh-so-good! Their tandoori chicken that the same friend got another time, is a little blah. I wouldn't recommend that. Service is pretty good here."
"4.0","I love Pittsburgh, PA it's a great city with great people. Being from San Francisco born and raised and Latino at times I've found it difficult to find a place that sells decent tacos and Latin food in PGH. I'm glad Doce taqueria is in the southside and just a few blocks away from where I stay when I visit. The tacos and beans are legit. I love the fact that they use queso fresco and crema. Staples for Latin food. The chicken and carnitas are on point. The tortillas are great and it's awesome that they give you options of corn or flour. The beans have a nice kick to them and go well paired with a couple tacos. Most importantly Steve and Carrie who work at Doce are great people who you can tell care about the quality of the food and make sure patrons are doing well. I'll be back in town soon and looking forward to having a few tacos and chatting with Steve and Carrie again."
"4.0","This is a solid, Italian restaurant.  Make no mistake, this place isn't for the snooty diners who are looking for fancy innovative Italian dishes.  It's not a hipster-chic spot in Lawrenceville, it's in Old Little Italy Bloomfield.  This place is like going to your Italian grandmother's house for dinner.  And while the decor can seem a bit out dated, it's a great atmosphere with a homey feel.Pros:The food here is great.  Everything we've had we've enjoyed.The place has an old wooden bar that is vey charmingThe bartenders are super nice and attentiveThe prices are very reasonableThe owners can often be seen in the dining room talking to and thanking guestsCons:The decor could be updated a bit, but the place has been around for a very long timeThe parking is like every other place in Bloomfield, street parkingOverall, this is a staple Italian place that you can get a reasonably priced meal in a relaxed atmosphere, with little to no fuss."

"5.0","I don't even know if I have the words to describe how awesome-sauce my Sausalido catering experience was for our wedding, but I'll give it a try!  Every step of the process, from tasting to day-of, Nick was professional, friendly, and no-nonsense.  We told him upfront what we wanted to spend, and he gave us amazing food and service at an even MORE amazing price.  He also didn't try to nickel and dime us like so many vendors involved in the wedding industry try to do.  Nick let us know immediately of different price options (for example, how much more colored linens are compared to black) and even gave very helpful suggestions on what we didn't need to spend money on (buying our pop rather than have a caterer provide it at an inflated price).Because our venue did not have a kitchen, all the food was made at the restaurant and brought over.  I worried about food drying out, getting cold, etc. - all for naught as all the food was the perfect temperature and moist.  Much care was taken with the display of food, including mirrors and flowers to accentuate and complement what was to be served.  Nick also worked with All Occasions to rent the plates and silverware, using his industry discount to again save us a few bucks.  He was even nice enough to bring all the ice we needed for the beer and pop!As if all this wasn't enough, Nick was actually at the venue the day-of and oversaw the set-up process.  This was very reassuring and also shows how much he truly cares about producing a quality product and service.  So many of our guests raved to me about the delicious food.  I give Nick and Sausalido my highest recommendation, and I know I will select Sausalido again for any future catering needs!"

"2.0","The great thing about Redfin is the riverside outdoor seating.  We had the lump crabcake, margherita pizza, and salad.  The crabcake and pizza crust (although the pizza itself was super greasy) were quite tasty.  However, the downfalls for Redfin (during my first experience) were the lackluster service and absence of draft beer.  My second experience there was much better in terms of service. In short, would recommend this place (and will definitely come back) during the summertime to grab drinks on their outdoor patio, but not recommended if you're looking for a good food."
"3.0","Sat outside one Thursday evening to have dinner. I was surprised out how cheap the food was here and how delicious it was. I had the crab cakes and I really enjoyed them. I was a bit shocked to find everything served in plastic (plastic plates, cups, and silverwear). Also, this is a cash only place. I guess that explains why their prices are so low. We didn't go inside, but from just looking thru the window, it didn't look like much. At the end of the day, good food and good service. I would go back."
"5.0","Employees were all working hard very nice and conversational.  My family and I enjoyed celebrating my birthday here over the weekend"
"5.0","A heavy metal themed vegan restaurant, sounds delicious. I had the egg roll and the Headbangers Balls. Both were excellent. The menu looks very interesting and I hope to go back soon to try other dishes."
"4.0","Best mex food in downtown delicious food wonderful ambience one star less for keeping guest to wait until all guests arrives"
"5.0","This place opened over the weekend and I was dying to try it today. Chicken sandwich was out of this world! Juicy, tender and DAMN hot. I ordered the hottest spice level, and it lived up to the name. Mac n cheese was good, sauce a little thick. Also wanted to mention that both cashiers were very nice, welcoming with great smiles. Going to go back when I'm not at work and I can enjoy a beer or 2. Definitely recommend trying this place."
"3.0","This is a 3.5, the drinks were great, awesome wines by the glass and of course a large beer selection.  However the appetizers were nothing to write home about.  The cheese platter was full of bland boring cheeses that were not worth the price . The pastrami was nearly all fat and dry.  The best thing tried was the duck confit fries and that was slightly above average. Very nice atmosphere, would go back JUST for drinks."
"5.0","Last night I planned on getting home from work, working out, eating a healthy dinner and going grocery shopping.  Instead I laid in bed until Pens traffic died down and dragged my roomie out to SouthSide with me to finally try some tacos from this place. And then we got ice cream. And I have no regrets.This place is so small you almost miss it, but it is located exactly to the right of Twelve on Carson and is adorable when you get inside.  It's narrow with about 8? barstools lining the counter and maybe two other hightops against the window.  It's decorated in sugar skulls and cool, bright colors and I didn't even mind waiting for my tacos because I was taking in all the décor!It was Taco Tuesday, but there weren't too many other people in there, probably because it was the first really cool day of the season (plus the Pens game!).  Even Tia, the bartender at Twelve who also works behind the counter at Doce was very surprised at how dead it was.  Service was quick.  I got one chicken and one carnitas taco and my roomie got a chicken (minus avocado) and Americano.  We inhaled them and they were excellent.  We ended up ordering one more each.  Our bellies were stuffed full and we paid (a whopping 11 dollars each for 3 filling tacos and a bottle of water) and were on our way!I agree with other reviewers when they say that these tacos are better than Las Palmas.  Doce's ingredients are carefully and perfectly executed and my tacos weren't falling apart in my hand like they ALWAYS do everywhere else in Pittsburgh.  They were so full of flavor and everything worked together so nicely.  I always find myself having to add hot sauce or more salsa or salt and pepper, but here - what they served was spot on.  I really liked this place and I think they are doing an amazing job.  I didn't mind the small menu at all and thought it was a nice thing to have a special of the day where you could get something different.  It would be nice to add a fish taco at some point to the regular menu though :) Thanks Doce..Cant wait to come back!"
"5.0","The bar tenders here take care of you so well, there's so much craft created in each drink. The atmosphere here is so living, whether be the numerous artwork scattered throughout the building, or the weekday special and daily board games, this bar is something above the rest. If you're looking for a bar with excellent drinks, lively vibe, and a cut above the rest, The Summit on Mt. Washington is the place to be"
"1.0","How does this place survive in the middle of Walnut Street?  I understand how people like to wait in line for hours for breakfast on a Sunday but I WOULD NOT do it for a place like this.  Given, our first mistake was going for breakfast at a place labeled a 'dive bar' on yelp---but still.  Perhaps the wait wasn't meant to be an hour but our waitress definitely FORGOT OUR ORDER and we sat there wondering what could be so tricky about some eggs and toast.  ...one hour and one complaint later...The food arrives.  Hot sauce was more difficult, took two requests before it came.  Of course I arrived last and ordered 30 min after everyone else but my food came first.  The food is basic and inexpensive, you get what you pay for.  In summary my Shadyside friends, unless it's a beautiful day and you just want to sit outside (their only plus is they have a few outside tables), keep on going down Walnut for some better options."
"5.0","This is my second 5 star in a row...and I don't give many.  My restaurant selections must getting better with age much like the 28 day dry aged steaks we had here last night!   I had the porterhouse and my wife the New York strip, both 28 day dry aged.  Without a doubt it was the best steak I have ever eaten.  Even better than the 40 day dry aged Himalayan sea salt ribeye steak I had at David Burke's in chitown.  No comparison really.   We had the calamari and roasted pepper appetizer and enjoyed it...could hardly eat it all.  Enjoyed our meal by splitting a yummy spinach salad topped with hot bacon dressing.  What a good night and good meal.  We were surprised with a 'first timer' free dessert.  It was a two sided plate with a chocolate fudge-like delight on one side and a wonderful cheesecake fusion on the other...it was so good we even ate the 'words off the plate'...have to be there know this. Heart of the city which is nice and a wonderful decor and atmosphere.  Comp valet parking makes parking in the city a breeze!  Don't forget this place when you crave good food and especially steak!  They made our 20th anniversary dinner a wonderful night."
"3.0","So I went to get me some chicken. I found this hip chicken shack on the University of Pittsburgh campus.Its hip, modern, fun and clean. They have chicken sandwiches with pickles, slaw, some kind of sauce and you pick the level of heat of which there are 5 levels. They also have chicken fingers and fries and homemade cookies. There are 2 levels of seating.I chose the medium heat chicken sandwich. It was good and savory and had just enough heat without feeling like you were being burned alive. I did think my chicken could have been a little more moist.I like this chicken shack and would want to try higher heat selections each time I go with their homemade cookies."
"4.0","Cafe Raymond was great stopped for breakfast. Cafe was clean and the employees were very nice and helpful when ordering. Food was good would like to go back to try lunch options as well. The blue berry ricotta pancakes were wonderful light fluffy and flavorful must try!"
"5.0","ALL YOU CAN EAT CRAB LEGS!!! At a great price is all I need to know. I'm a crab legs Lover. Best place in town to eat out."
"5.0","Great place, knowledgeable and alert bartenders, and the food is outstanding!!  Extensive selection of beer and house created cocktails are exceptional. Go here, well worth the stop."
"2.0","A year or so ago when I ate the beans and greens from this truck, it was really very good - lots of flavorful greens cooked just right - tender but still crunchy.  I was happy to see them back in my neighborhood today, so I ordered the closest thing on their menu, which was a beans and greens and pasta dish.  While it was still fairly tasty, there was very minimal amount of anything except pasta, and the beans seemed mushy like from a can.  This meal is what I would throw together in 5 min in a pinch; not what I would buy when out with other food trucks and restaurants around.  I wish I hadn't spent $10 + tip on this."
"3.0","First I want to say this is the location in Southside. If this was the food truck it would be a dramatically different story.but to be honest I was quite underwhelmed going to Doce Taqueria. I don't see all the hype. They are just 3 dollar tacos... it isn't bad I would say it's just decent.What puts it at a 3/5 is the space. You are stuck in an extremely crammed area which can't seat more than 10 people. An the menu is unapproachable since I had no idea what half of the options on the menu exactly are. If they had a description of what the options where like most other foreign restaurants it would help it dearly."
"3.0","I pretty much got my dad obsessed with pho when my family came out to California for my graduation in April. Everytime he calls me now he asks if I've had any pho lately. So, when I came back to the 'Burgh for a visit he was all about finding a Vietnamese place in the city to get some more. My parents and I had spent the afternoon in the Strip District, and enjoyed a few beers at Roland's before heading over to Tram's for dinner. We were hungry and the portions were huge, tasty and the reasonably priced. We decided to get three different entrees and all share. Obviously, we got the pho with beef, the fresh spring rolls, a spicy/bbq shrimp plate that came with white rice, and a vermicelli bowl with pork. Everything was pretty tasty. The pho broth was a little salty for my preference, but it had a wonderful lemongrass aroma and taste. Also, usually I get fried or garlic rice with any rice dish I order from my favorite place in Cali, but the shrimp was very good and not at all over-coooked, as so many places do these days. The vermicelli dish was right on, and other than the fact that I prefer egg rolls to spring rolls, those were tasty as well, especially with the dipping sauce they provided.I'd give this place 3 and a half stars. It was, overall, a good dining experience and service was quick, despite the neighborhood being a little sketchy and the inside being a little divey. Also, a personal comment. I firmly believe pho is a miracle cure for the cold/flu. Anytime I get sick I head over to my pho place and order a huge bowl with beef and then add plenty of Siracha sauce. I always wake up the next day feeling like a million bucks.  So, if you're feeling sick (especially around this time of year) try it out. Even if it doesn't work for you, you'll still get some tasty food : )"
"3.0","I had a veggie omelet here for a late breakfast; it came with a pastry and a little side salad. Honestly it is a good bit of food for the price, but I'd have preferred a bit less food and a bit less price. The omelet was ok but I wouldn't say it is the best that I've had and I wish they would have grated the smoked gouda instead of putting larger slices of it."
"1.0","I got delivery for gluten free noodles. It was all oily and the noodles we're all broken. So gross. I mean not just oil used but literally drenched in a soupy oil. If you want oil soup noodles this is the place to go. Worst $20+ of my life spent on take out. Ew!"
"4.0","Love love love Fazios as our neighborhood pizza place! Be ready to know what you want and order straightforward, they're not rude just the type of ship they run. Great lunch special of two slices and a drink $5! I have had wedges, salad, wings, hoagie and pizza and continue to order these over and over. It's a lil greasy but that's what makes it good! Right??"
"1.0","Although the burgers and fries are very flavorful, mine were cold.  I had the bacon burger which comes with lettuce and tomato, but the coldness was not from the vegetables. The fries were cold and limp. I was here early, about an hour before the start of the game. So they either served yesterdays's food or they cooked it hours before the game. This is simply unacceptable for a burger and fries that cost $19.25 together. I would have taken them back, but I carried them up to the Pittsburgh Baseball Club and figured by the time I got back downstairs, they'd say it was my fault. These items hadn't cooled off. They were cold."
"5.0","Azorean Cafe is a great example of the growing food industry in Pittsburgh. This Azorean/Portuguese cafe is located right on Liberty Avenue in Bloomfield and offers a very unique menu for breakfast and lunch. You have the option to order classic American food, but there are also a lot of great meals for those daring enough to step out of their comfort zones. I decided to try a traditional Azorean lunch and ordered the Polvo Guisado, which is a baked octopus dish that resembles a sort of stew. The flavors were very foreign to me but I really enjoyed it and appreciated the quality of the food. My friends ordered omelettes for their meals and were all very content as well."
"4.0","Las Velas is great authentic Mexican food in market square.  I definitely recommend the Velada which is served in a cutout Pineapple bowl with tons of different meats and cheese.  It is perfect for two people and delicious.  Las Velas is very laid back and usually no need for a reservation."
"3.0","Rocky's is the kind of place my family loves, and I look at them like they are crazy.  Extremely greasy, divey joints are not my thing.  At all.  But they dragged me here one Saturday morning, and Rocky's is what it is.  No frills divey breakfast.Exceptionally greasy food makes me ill, and Rocky's succeeded at doing that.  I don't eat potatoes, and every breakfast meal option came with potatoes.  There is no variety, the menu has 10 things tops.  To top that off, they were out of a lot of things.  But you know what?  Where else can you go for breakfast and eat for around $5 per person including a drink?No bathrooms.  They must be grandfathered in, or they are just running a super illegal business.  Either way, when you are feeling violently ill after eating a meal here or just need to pee from drinking coffee, you'll be miserable, if you are like me.Why three stars?  Because my dad is watching me type this and told me that I couldn't give them two.  So for my dad and the cheap prices, three stars.  Bring your family members ages 50+ here.  They'll appreciate it."
"5.0","Good quality, great value, in a comfortable laid-back environment. A must for lunch!Tell Gisele I sent you in for the walk-in special."
"3.0","This place is generally clean. Bagels are fresh and sometimes you can get a bundle off bagels at a lower price. Bruegger's cream cheese are pretty decent, too. Coffee is okay. I wouldn't say it is cheap, because special recipe bagel sandwich can go quite pricy for just a breakfast."
"4.0","You can't beat an $8 Indian lunch buffet. However only one of the dishes on the buffet has any meat and it was some overcooked chicken. Besides that the mushrooms were excellent and the staff was friendly. I'll definitely be stopping in again someday."
"5.0","Came across this place on OpenTable. Walked into a warm welcome, very comprehensive menu explaining all of the ethnic dishes. I chose the pork chops stuffed with bacon and cheese. My date chose the beef over dumplings. We received incredibly generous portions. It was suggested for me to try the Hungarian red wine. I absolutely loved it! They also carry Hungarian beer. Not very many traditional ethnic restaurants like this exist anymore ! We look forward to returning"
"5.0","It's no secret in my Yelp reviews that I LOVE tacos, so when I had been hearing my friends rave about this place for weeks, I knew I had to check it out.  My roommate and I ventured down Carson Street and entered the quaint, colorful restaurant.  A handful of seats are at the cement bar surrounding the taco prep area, and a few more at the window counter.  I was surprised that it wasn't busy, but glad that we were able to grab seats.  I will be honest, I wasn't impressed with the service right off the bat, as it took the two employees working about 5 minutes to even acknowledge that we were standing there.  They were working on putting together a couple of orders, but a nod or 'hello' to acknowledge our presence and impending orders would've been nice.  The gal working finally found a second to take our orders: 3 tacos for me (pork, chicken, and Americano), and 1 taco (pork) and an order of black beans for my roommate.The tacos came out in a jif, on warm, corn tortillas as requested.  These tacos are the perfect size and good LORD are they delicious.  My favorites, in order, would be the chicken, Americano and pork.  The pork was good, although the slaw that comes on it isn't something I'm a fan of... I'm just not a slaw fan in general so I won't hold that against them.Doce also offers a cooler full of fun drinks to wash your meal down with, for $2 a pop.  When the check came, I was shocked.  $18. That's it? Should I order more tacos? I mean, EIGHTEEN BUCKS for four tacos, an order of black beans, and two drinks?  I did the math in my head and it checked out.  At $3 a taco, Doce has an advantage over one of my other taco faves in the city, and the location is prime.  I will absolutely be back to this place again and again.  They offer takeout as well!"
"5.0","Currently standing here drinking my iced latte and waiting on my breakfast sandwich. I was wondering what was taking 'so long'.... it's been less than 5 minutes, but you know, IMPATIENT.So I walk over to where the sandwich making is going on. Y'ALL. He's making my food. I don't know what I was expecting, probably some McDonald's microwaved egg sandwich and whatnot, but NO. He has a damn frying pan out and is MAKING. MY. SANDWICH.He's scrambling eggs, toasting my bagel, and legitimately cooking every single thing to order.Basically, I don't care what this sandwich tastes like, he made it from his heart with love and I'm going to eat it and be happy about it.Also, you should stop here and eat and drink too."
"5.0","I had the pleasure of dining at Girasole's while on a recent business trip. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, full of happy people enjoying the amazing food and drink. I was dining alone, but not for long, as Jimmy Pie, the charming patriarch of the restaurant joined me providing much welcomed company and conversation. The delicious food and heartwarming stories were just what this travel-weary, East Coast to West Coast transplant needed. You don't get restaurants with this much heart in California and I found myself teary with nostalgia for my small town Pennsylvania roots and a time gone by. I will definitely be back whenever I'm in Pittsburgh."
"4.0","Doce is No Nonsense, and they have a straight-forward approach to tacos: Ultra-fresh, quality ingredients = Amazing Tacos. You won't even mind the lack of octopus or duck confit, promise. The short but solid menu is well thought out and includes a daily special for those who shun conformity. These are exceptional tacos for the price. And the people who work here are cool as a cucumber (topped with fresa cheese, for good measure.)"
"3.0","Whenever we eat in, it's been great. Every time we get take out though, something gets missed! Usually it's just sauce, but I was super bummed today to be missing a side of mac and cheese for the second time out of a handful of times we've gotten take out.Guess we should have learned by now to check our boxes before leaving with our food.I've also noticed the past few times we've gone, the chicken is less and less heavily seasoned, which is what distinguishes Nashville style hot chicken from just regular spicy tenders. And this also means less spicy. My bf got the medium tenders today and found them quite mild, while my hot tenders were less spicy than the medium used to be.The chicken itself was still tasty, but I hope the heat can be cranked up again - being able to get legitimately HOT chicken is what makes this place really unique. Also, I'll definitely check my food before taking it to go from now on, but hopefully some kind of system can be worked out to avoid forgetting parts of orders as often."
"5.0","The Summit has recently become one of my favorite bars on the Mount. I can't comment on the food, but in regards to atmosphere and drink selections, it's great!They truly offer something for everyone, whether you like wine, beer, or cocktails, there is a wide selection of all of them. My fiancé loved their Old Fashions, and said it was one of the best he's ever had! Lately I've been feeling sour beers and I was blown away by all of the sour beer options they had - it was its own section of the menu! I also love that The Summit has a bunch of games to play and actually no TVs on the walls. I feel like this gives everyone the opportunity to hang out, have fun, and enjoy each others' company without distractions. While the pricing is a little more expensive than some of the other bars on Mount Washington, it is also just a 'classier' vibe, and you get what you pay for. They do offer a happy hour from 5-7 on weekdays, too."
"1.0","This rating is not for the food or service, both were fine!I have to say I was very uncomfortable entering and leaving because of a vagrant standing in front of the door asking for money from myself and others as we entered and left the shop. Management should be on top of this issue."
"5.0","This place has been on my want-to-go-there list for nearly as long as its been open.  I've since moved away from Shadyside, making it more and more unlikely that I'd ever go.  I was meeting a friend for dinner in the area last week - dinner location was up to me, and, when searching restaurants in the area on Yelp, Girasole popped up and I thought 'ah, here's my chance!'  I called ahead for reservations - that was probably a smart move - it was pretty busy.  Dinner was AMAZING.  My friend got the spinach ricotta ravioli and I got the linguine rustic.  The starting salads were really good - the toppings added a great flavor to the greenery and the dressing was nice.  But my dinner - I was blown away by my dinner.  This was probably the best clam-sauce pasta dish I have ever had.  My mother used to make pasta with clam sauce when I was younger, so generally, if a restaurant has it available, I get it.  Most places, however, don't usually do a dish like this.  I now live in the North Hills, but honestly, I would totally consider driving down into Shadyside just to get this again.  My friend also said she loved her ravioli.  She said she doesn't normally go meat-less but she was very pleased with her selection.  I'm so glad I finally made it to Girasole, and now am kind of sad I didn't make it a higher priority.  I'll definitely be returning, hopefully sooner than later."
"5.0","The chicken tagines are so yummy! My kids love the pizzas. We really love the different options that we can't get anywhere else. We always call in ahead and pick it up."
"5.0","Delanie's is a great local place in South Side Pittsburgh to grab breakfast and a coffee. The coffee is really good and what I enjoy the most are the breakfast sandwiches! Randy the manager makes them just like you would for yourself at home... Fresh ingredients and well put together MTO."
"4.0","So relaxing sitting outside, great ambience. Delicious beer battered chicken sandwich. Would definately go back!"
"4.0","I really like the atmosphere of Mezzo. I came here for an early dinner last night and since it was warm, the large windows were open. I ordered fried zucchini and an arugula salad; both of which were pretty good. The chefs have a strict policy of no substitutions so I was told that I could not order my salad and add chicken for a protein. I still enjoyed my experience."
"5.0","I came here for brunch for the first time this morning and had a great experience! They are a vegan restaurant that also offers gluten free options. I ordered the avocado toast, latkas and a vanilla latte... all were super yummy! They offer full service as well as options you can purchase to go at the counter. I went for the full service and the server was very friendly and knowledgeable. The only thing i would change is that for the latkas, typically they are served with apple sauce and they don't have it so i had ketchup instead. I'll definitely be back soon though to try the kombucha and tofu scramble that I've heard is incredible!"
"5.0","I was really glad to find this place inside the hospital, as there aren't many options up here unless you walk all the way down the hill to 5th or go to Starbucks or the cafeteria. Service was a little slower than I expected but the pizza was delicious. They had a range of items including, pizza, sandwiches and salads. You order at the counter and they bring it to your table. They bake the pizzas to order in a brick oven."
"1.0","I'm new to the Hello Bristro craze however after my trip to this location it'll likely be my last.I have gone to HB a handful of times, this being my first at this location. It was a Friday afternoon-November 11, around 4/5pm and the place wasn't too busy but it looked like I had just missed the rush with the place looking a mess. When it came to order the dressing, I noticed the amount first poured wasn't as much as I'd like and asked for a little more extra. The employee poured way more than necessary. He was nice so maybe he isn't a salad eater or maybe he made a mistake. Also, while this went on I was distracted by another employee at the end of the line eating croutons. In retrospect I should've asked for a new salad but I decided to try it. Needless to say I had to throw it away after a few bites. Nothing worse than throwing away your lunch while at work. I emailed HB about my experience and was contacted after then but when I tried calling back after minutes of ringing my call was eventually disconnected. Ultimately I feel like this falls on management. Keeping a clean restaurant, proper training of employees, and enforcing safe food handling standards is the job of the manager. The employee, again, was kind and I sincerely feel like he didn't realize the amount was way too much. Training employees better on serving sizes would help this issue. As for the cleanliness and employees eating around food-it's up to the manager to correct these issues. I like the idea of HB and would love to see these issues resolved (also not a fan of the ordering process, paying first seems to slow this down-also it always seems to be understaffed). I would love to return but until changes are made I'm going to spend my money elsewhere."
"4.0","I always come here for their Korma curry and the creamy curry with spinach, these are my favorites! Add whatever protein you like and it's great. The appetizer I would pick is Chicken 65. This place is good for friend and family gatherings, with natural lights shining in - very relaxing. I am a non-spicy eater, and I like it here!"
"3.0","We have been here several times but it's been a few years since we had been there because so many new restaurants have opened in Pittsburgh. The food was excellent. The Stoli Doli drink they are known for is delicious. But the service was poor. That's why I have to give 3 stars. There were 3 of us. The bill was $350. I never complain about the cost of great meals and I've eaten in the best restaurants around the world. But when food is this expensive, the service must be in alignment with the cost of the food. We were finished eating for 15 minutes before our waitress appeared. Then when she did appear, we asked for the check so we wouldn't have to wait longer to get the bill. I think they need to step up their game since Eddie V's is just a few blocks up the street. The picture is of the steak tartare appetizer."
"4.0","Overall, a friendly and fast environment. Great music always playing on the speakers during the lunch rush hours, marked by good service/communication by the employees to customers. Fantastic food at all four locations; is a great place to walk down to on your lunch break/late afternoon hunger. Reasonably priced food, with a 'chill' atmosphere."
"5.0","This is my go to restaurant for Chinese food downtown. My parents and I discovered it on a trip many years ago when I went to PPU. Their entrees are family size, so make sure you have either a) empty stomachs, or b) a friend to share the food with. Or c) space in your fridge at home for leftovers"
"3.0","Now, I've only been to two different Thai places in Pittsburgh, the other being Nicki's. I did enjoy Nicki's slightly better, and I think they are a 4 or 5. So. Here we are. Service was pretty on par. Water barely was ever empty, and the food came out in under ten minutes after ordering. Which was awesome but at the same time actually kind of startling. We both had curry, I assume they prepare a  bunch of it in the back and just finish it up and serve it. Not that that's a bad thing, I'm not a professional, and I don't know proper curry preparation practices. Lol. So maybe this is normal. The flavor was pretty good; I'd say it was on the same level or a slight step lower compared to the other place I've been to. However, I did find the chicken to be pretty chewy which was a turn off, and my only real complaint. The lunch curry came with a choice of lemongrass or wonton soup. I got the wonton, good choice, it was wholesome and savory. It also came with a small spring roll. I will definitely come back here to try some different dishes! Oh, shit almost forgot. The Thai tea was great!"
"3.0","Awesome, great good and staff. Only beef is they hand wash the coffee cups up front. Get a dishwasher!"
"4.0","This quaint, hole in the wall (quite literally, I passed it three times before I found it) rustic Italian treasure is a must try! You walk into Girasole and you will instantly be greeted like family. The ambiance has a warm closeness like you're amongst friends you haven't seen in a long time. The cocktails are done right and the food is fantastic. Great flavors and beautiful presentation on the food."
"1.0","Had reservations for a party of 17 for 6:30. Our pasta took until 8:30 to come out. The pasta 'sauce' was disgusting, it was basically tomato chunks on dry pasta. The meatballs were as big as my head and that's pretty damn big but unfortunately that tasted horrible too. The bruschetta had absolutely no balsamic on it and had zero flavor except for the huge pieces of onion. The Mozzarella Caprese also did not have any balsamic on it and the cheese tasted like playdoh. One of us got completely raw Salmon, I mean raw, rawer than my fat thighs after a hot day in jean shorts. If you are looking for authentic Italian, this ain't it honey. They also stuff the shells with pork which I've never heard of before and the poor Jewish woman with us who ordered them is sitting in her hotel room filled with guilt and has to talk to her rabbi tomorrow. We left so much food on the table it was sinful. The manager did take a reasonable amount off the bill which we appreciated, but that doesn't make the food edible. I never complain about food because I'm fat and eat just about anything, but this was absolutely the worst meal we've ever had. All 17 of us agreed."
"4.0","I love this place! I love the idea of paying a flat price for as many toppings as you want! I picked out a flatbread with all of the vegetables and mozzarella cheese. It was super delicious and I loved that you could choose garnishes for your pizza after it cooked. The staff could've been more attentive and kind but other than that, I will be back!"
"1.0","Waited in line get my order and left with only half the order, When I came back for the food the order taker accused me of ' forgetting the wings' and continued to berate me in front of a line of customers. When I got home and checked my receipt I noticed she didn't use my coupon. Worst customer service ever!!!"
"5.0","Hambone's. When I walk into this place I half expect to hear 'NORM!' shouted. Even though I'm not a regular. Or named Norm. it has that vibe. Everyone knows everyone, and the people are friendly. Behind the bar you will find Jeff Holt, who bought into the bar a year ago or so, and things have really turned around. He brought the old Papa J's Thursday Night comedy open mic with him, and a personality that embraces the old and the new. Lawrenceville is overrun with hipsters, music 'clubs', pricier eating venues, and trendy places like the new Franktuary. All that is great, and makes it a lively place to be, but Hambone's is the old corner bar. This is where the old steel workers still drink at 3pm, and you can hear the stories of old. Also, they have a great happy hour, and if you live in the East End you should definitely stop in on your way home from downtown. The lunch and dinner are sort of a mix between a diner and a pub, but the food is fantastic, with daily specials and many many options. Hambone's is quite possibly my favorite Lawrenceville bar."

"1.0","I'm not one to typically write reviews on here. Pittsburgh is a place with few good Mexican restaurants and this is one of the better places, but after the customer service my friends and I received last night I doubt I will ever return. We had already eaten at another restaurant earlier that day and just stepped in for drinks and dessert. My girlfriend and a mutual friend ordered a pitcher of sangria, which our friend had mentioned she had gotten there for $11.00 several weeks ago. There were not sizes mentioned on the menu, but they did show for a price for about 8 ounce and a price for 23 ounces = around $11 dollars. They naturally assumed this was the pitcher and order it. We got the pitcher, and were at first excited since it looked like the container was holding about 40 ounces--maybe they didn't account for the ice, we though. However, when we got the receipt it showed a $35 dollar charge for a margarita pitcher. We called the server over who explained that the pitchers weren't on the menu and that the pitchers for sangrias and margaritas were recently made the same price (even though 23 ounce mojitos were listed at over $20s on the menu?) She got a manager who agreed that there was about 40 ounces in the pitcher, and I asked how then would it be more expensive than buy two 'large' sangiras which would have been over 46 ounces. He then simply stated that the owners set the price, not him, so there was nothing he he could do. I asked about price discrepancy for the sangrias and margritas and the menu, and again he blamed the owners. He then took our cards and rushed away. I was livid and mentioned I wanted to talk the the owners if that was the case. We got our cards back and stay away debating what to do. Maybe 15-20 mins past and another server (or manager) came over with shots of tequila and apologized, saying that they recently changed their glassware and that is why the pitchers were off the menu and there were no pricing options. They couldn't even keep their story straight. The staff here obviously was trying to take advantage of us, either because they thought we were relatively young, more drunk than we were, or both. The comp obviously did not make up for this ordeal or the fact we were fed lie after lie to cover themselves.Its a shame I can no longer recommend this restaurant to any friends or family."
"4.0","Stopped here today as a friend really wanted to try the place. We were greeted right away, and sat at a small table across from the bar. I really like the menu with nice descriptions given along with the Hungarian names of the dishes. The waitress was very helpful with any questions about the food. I had the Goulash,   which is a soup with tender pieces of beef with potatoes and little dumplings like the German spatzle in a very flavorful broth. I also had the cucumber salad with sour cream. Both were very good. My companion had the chicken paprikas, and the cabbage salad which she found to be excellent. This was all very homey comfort food. The thing that was very outstanding were the deserts.We had ordered something called Kremes and a thing that looked like an eclair and split them between us to share. My and her favorite was the Kremes. It had a flaky top and bottom with a light custard filling. All the deserts look fabulous and I don't think you would go wrong with any pick.I believe the prices were very good as my soup and salad was almost $20. If I had gotten and entree instead of the soup it would have only been 5-10 dollars more.Parking on the other hand is a pain. There is a tiny lot that holds maybe 5 cars. Limited parking on the street around the corner which during the day is limited to 2 hours."
"5.0","Had dinner here after we arrived in Pittsburgh. It was located inside the station square. We had tempura, sushi rolls, teriyaki and some desserts. We chose Monongahela roll, which had eel, avocado and tobiko in it. We had shrimp and veggie tempura, which included shrimp, potato, sweet potato asparagus and etc. They all yummy! The chicken teriyaki was a little bit over cooked. I had matcha cheese cake and my friend had mochi ice cream for dessert, which served as a nice ending of our dinner."
"5.0","I am always up for trying new Asian restaurants and I can honestly say Umami did not disappoint. First, I would like to point out that if you are not into climbing 3 flights of stairs this may not be the place for you. These stairs are STEEP and after a few drinks it could get dangerous. It isn't a very large place and I could see it filling up rather fast around dinner time. My friend and I arrived around 4:15 and we were the first ones there. They have high top table seating only, so if you are not into that this also may not be the place for you. For our drinks we ordered the tickle n giggle. Which is basically a Japanese take on a mojito. I personally wouldn't get this drink again, but it seems to be pretty popular here. The menu is izakaya style, so you order little bits at a time. I highly recommend the robatayaki. I ordered the pork belly and beef tenderloin. Both were glazed with tare, which is like a sweet soy sauce. I also ordered the Japanese fried chicken with gravy. This was probably my least favorite out of everything we ordered, but I still enjoyed it very much. They give you a lot of chicken for it being small bites. My friend and I shared the pork and shrimp shumai, which is an open faced dumpling. There was a total of 6 dumplings and each were stuffed very generously with pork, edamame and shrimp. The next dish we shared was the yaki udon. This came with egg, mushroom dashi, shiitake mushrooms, scallion, and barrel aged soy. The udon noodles were cooked just right and all of the flavors melded together perfectly.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to try Japanese street food. It is totally worth every penny for the amount of food you get."
"4.0","We order delivery often and the service is always prompt and we love the pizza. And they take credit cards!"
"5.0","I LOVED Girasole! It was the most adorable spot ever. We came from out of town and walked over to Shadyside from Oakland. Upon arriving at Girasole's, it was PACKED, but we didn't have to wait too long before the proprietor found us a table. In the meantime, Pittsburgh natives chatted with us and suggested popular dishes (the consensus is that everything is delicious). We got the Bruschetta to start - omg to die for, so delicious - bursting with ripe tomatoes and the perfect blend of herbs and cheese!  My date got the squid ink linguine, and I got the ravioli. The pasta was fresh and so tasty, not to mention piping hot! We had great wine pairings based on the suggestion of our server, and the proprietor and a friend sang while playing the guitar (while sporting a glass of red wine in hand). It felt very authentic Italian, and cozy. If I lived in Pitt, I would be back all the time!"
"1.0","my husband and I really love Indian food and before we moved here from Baltimore we'd order it via delivery pretty frequently. So we decided to give this place a shot. Calling the order in was painful, The person who was taking the order had us repeat numbers frequently and even after spelling Walnut twice, he still did not seem sure that he knew what we were telling him. We should have taken this as a sign.I ordered palak paneer - my favorite - what arrived was very different - something with peas and it was orange instead of green. When we called in to complain the person who answered the phone did not understand what the problem was and passed the phone to someone else who argued with us telling us we did not order palak paneer but what I found out later to be mata paneer. I've never even heard of this - we did not have a menu and just ordered our favorites.  Instead of trying to make the situation right, by replacing the food or offering to remove the wrong dish from our bill ,they offered the next entree free. We continued with dinner and immediately we knew this was the worst Indian carry out we'd ever had. the sauces were really thin and tasted weird. The cheese in my dish had a really off texture compared to the dozen or so places I've ordered this dish from. Since I had never tried mata paneer before maybe it is supposed to taste like a lot of sugar was added. I do, however, know that Tikka Masala is not supposed to taste sour. We had asked for both to be medium spicy but the chef must have put the spice in twice, it was so hot that it was barely edible. The garlic and regular nan, on the other hand, was excellent. The rice that came with it lacked all of the cardamon pods etc in it that I've always had with indian carry out.... it was just plain, really dry, unseasoned rice.After tossing out most of it both of us felt very ill and bloated after the meal, i really thought I was going to vomit. Between the service and the lack of quality of the meal, we will never order from this place again. They can keep their free entree."
"4.0","I came here for dessert. This will be my go to dessert for the entire city. ...............Caramel popcorn panna cotta.................I don't think people understand how amazing this dessert is! The first time I had it was when the chef presented it at Dinner Lab. It blew everyone away. I'm so happy they are keeping it on the menu.Try it, I promise you will fall in love!"
"4.0","I came here for brunch with a few friends and had the chicken and waffles, a classic combination of sweet & salty. I'm usually not one to enjoy all of the provided house made sauces but the ones here were delicious and each complimented the chicken and waffles well. I also had some sweet potato fries which were great as well. I don't have much to say other than the food was really good!"
"5.0","I have never been to any other restaurants as many times as I went to Salem! The food is always fresh and delicious. The people are very nice and cordial. If you like Asian (Bangladeshi, Indian, Pakistani) food, you should definitely give it a try!"
"2.0","Las Velas was suggested to me as a great place to get Mexican food. As a party for two, we arrived on a Sunday night at 7. The restaurant had open tables, but we were brushed off by a waitress who told us it would be 5 minutes. They didn't have a hostess to handle people coming in. Once we were at the table, we had three different people trying to take our order. There clearly should have been someone put in charge of our table as opposed to the waiters fighting for us. We ordered chips and salsa for $3 (should be free at any Mexican restaurant). It took a while to come, but a group of police officers who came at least 10 minutes after us were already halfway through their second basket by the time ours came. The chips, once they did arrive, were a bit thick for my preference, and the salsa was too watery. Our entrees came after another long wait. I understood that they were understaffed, but the food was lukewarm! If the waiter wasn't sitting, flirting with the police officers, maybe this wouldn't have been an issue. The flavor of the food was nothing to write home about, but not bad."
"2.0","Avoid this place like the plague. Never have I ever walked a more consistently inconsistent Brueggers than this one. Today when I came in, it was the cashier who initially took my order, then handed it off to one of the workers on the line. This is where my order may have gotten lost. Since everything gets rung up at the end, there is no real system keeping track of what was ordered (including any modifications and allergies), making it easy to mess things up. The toasted asiago bagel with onion and chive cream cheese I ordered then became an untoasted cinnamon bagel with onion and chive. Ultimately I had to toss my entire bagel since I was already at my destination and could not get it remade.The real issue here is the lack of a proper ordering system and a reliance on verbal communication between workers. If I had any real allergies (like a nut or dairy allergy) I would not trust this place to handle it. If you like weird bagel combinations and living life on the edge, this location is for you. For me, I'll be sticking to better places nearby."
"2.0","This place is old, like your grandparents basement. It looks charming with all the old decor of a knock-off Dean Martin second-hand yard sale.Anything positive ends with 'charm', when you enter that back dinning room your nose is greeted with all to familiar scent of piss, like really old piss, that's been festering for a couple days...just imagine pee'ing and not flushing the toilet, like ever. I got the spaghetti and meat balls with Angel hair and sauce. The spaghetti was over cooked, the sauce had a heavy dose of dried parsley and meatball had zero flavor. I actually didn't know meat could could achieve that level of bland. It's was $17, they charged me $2 per meatball, and $13 for the pasta.My daughter got a side of angel hair (they have no kids menu, because this is a place for adults, really old adults who haven't the slightest fucking clue how too eat) pasta with butter, $6. They give u a basket of bread that's about 5 minutes from being a crouton.This place is like Del's, out dated with a complacent owner(s) who don't give fuck or just don't get It, luckily they should be out of business within the next two years."
"2.0","Very average Italian food.  If you're looking for a pasta+sauce experience, it's pretty boring.  Eggplant parm was a little better than average.  But all in all, not any more exciting than what I can make for myself with a jar of sauce and box of pasta."

"5.0","This place is so cool! Came in from Nashville for a wedding and was told the Hall of Famer would change my life...it did! Bones, our server, aka Chris Feathers, was an awesome guy! He gave us crack in a cup and was just an all around good guy. You knew he loved his job. Thank you Chris!"
"4.0","Came to the Summit for happy hour after my parents told me what a great time they had here. Cons of the Summit: even though it's on Mt Washington, you don't get that overlook view.  Pros on the Summit: the drinks; and Grandview Ave is only a block away if you need to see the city skyline after you have a few. Oh and there are charging outlets right under the bar, what a great feature! Happy hour is 5-7, during which cocktails are $6! It was a Tuesday, we walked in at 6, and there was plenty of seating. Even though I complained about the lack of view, the space does have a large window open to Shiloh street which is nice when the weather is good.  I had the Amabel and the Sex Tape. If you go and read the descriptions, you'll see that these are pretty close to the same thing (gin, grapefruit), but the Amabel was my favorite."
"4.0","As one of the few places in Pittsburgh (that I know of) that sell korean fried chicken, it does the trick. The chicken is nice and crispy and tossed in the sauce of your choice (sweet & spicy, soy garlic or spicy soy). Some pieces are fatty, but that is up to chance. They also sell other small dishes. The tteokbokki has the rice cakes, fish cake, cabbage, and cheese for $1 extra but is too sweet for my tastes. I have also tried the chicken gangjeong but wasn't the biggest fan. The takoyaki is not bad though. I am not the biggest bubble tea drinker but the drinks that I have gotten from here is pretty much on par with other tea shops in Oakland. The tapioca pearls were firm and had a nice chew to them (though they are smaller than what I'm used to). I usually just get plain iced tea when I go.Overall, it's a solid little shop. The food there doesn't blow me away but it satisfies my cravings."
"5.0","I've never been to a restaurant where I have received such great service!  The waitstaff was very knowledgeable about all of the different menu items. My glass was always full and staff was attentive but not overwhelming. We had the Lamb Pasta, the Italian cheese tray, and the sausage and Pepper appetizer.  The server explained all of the different cheese to us and pairings. The cheese were definitely not for us but it was still very interesting to try them all. The sausage and Pepper appetizer was delicious as was the lamb pasta. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone!"
"4.0","The Yard is great for a dinner out with friends! They have a ton of grilled cheese options, all served with your choice of any kind of fries and some tomato soup. I had the Crabby Patty (gotta love a SpongeBob reference) with Old Bay fries, and it was the best grilled cheese I've ever had! The service is good, and the venue is located in busy Shadyside so it's a good place to go for dinner and a drink before a night out. Overall a relaxed atmosphere with some amazing comfort food!I've also been to the Yard for brunch, and they have a fantastic unlimited mimosa/Bloody Mary bar. Would highly recommend!"

"4.0","For the longest time, I heard Tram's Kitchen was the place to go for great Vietnamese food.  So off I went with another one of my foodie friends last night.  I walked in, and the decor was...pretty bad, but that's pretty run-of-the-mill for a chinese  restaurant.  Watermelons on the tablecloths, generic wall decor...whatever.We ended up seating ourselves, I'm still not sure if we were supposed to or not, the staff wasn't very talkative, I'm assuming they didn't speak much english.  We both ordered the Beef Pho and Shrimp Spring Rolls.So first major hiccup, our Pho came out, no sign of the spring rolls, though our waiter asked us 'You want any spring roll?''Yes.  Yes I do.' -.-Well we get our spring rolls, pretty good.  The sauce they brought out with it seemed like hoisin sauce with a pretty odd taste.  One piece of halved shrimp was all I found in the roll, which was a bummer, but it was cheap, so I'll let it slide.The pho was great.  Nice aromatics, a hint of cinnamon, a decent amount of beef for the price, and a heaping plate of sprouts and limes to accompany it.  The only complaints I could pose were that it was very mild, and it a bit spicier.Overall, above average, but my quest for the perfect Pho continues."
"5.0","Outstanding!  Bravo!  Molto bene!Went to Stagioni for a business dinner, and what a treat this little gem was!  The food and service was impeccable.  I love the small 'hole-in-the-wall' feel.  You can tell that the chef is likely someone with a genuine Italian heritage who has this cuisine in their blood.  The authentic feel really shines.I recommend everything on the menu.  When bringing wine, don't bring anything too abrasive with the reds.  Keep it balanced and fresh on the palate, as these will match best with the food."

"1.0","I am a food critic from Atlanta - here in Pittsburgh on business.  Stopped into this place briefly.   Hoping to find a bite before my next call.  Simply put - this place is a rat-hole.  I was sitting at the bar where the gnats had more than 100 x the patronship.  Somebody from'Corporate' was here training - and the one table they had was neglected.  The mom found menus for her kids.  I travel ALL the time and can relate to restaurants - this one - don't bother.  Instead go to Bar Louie which is across the street."
"1.0","I love indian food and know it well. I think they have such a great location that it does not matter if the food is good. People continue to go to this location. The new Indian resteraunt that opened on south craig ,next to the beer distributaries is awesome. The buffet is amazing, and unfortunately it was closed for a late lunch and so was tamarind. I gave it a second try and my friend could not eat her palak paneer. Tasteless and expensive. Continue to walk past this place to the buffet on south craig, trust me on this one, I just returned from India."
"4.0","One of the Best Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh. If you are close to Carnegie Mellon University you ought to try this place. Great flavors - Authentic Indian."
"5.0","Awesome!  My kids and I had a great time here to try some food that isn't from a chain restaurant (we live in the north hills and chains are all we have). This was really fun...we each picked a different dish as our favorite.  The waiter explained everything and it was a great, enjoyable experience!"
"5.0","Las Velas is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh. The food is excellent. I highly recommend the fajitas and if you get the chips, spring for the queso. The only downsides are that they haven't jumped on any apps like No Wait or Open Table, the limited accessibility (2nd floor location - steep stairs) and of course, the chips and salsa aren't free."
"5.0","Around the side of Round Corner Cantina you will find a wooden door, go through, head up the stairs, and you will find yourself in Umamai, a bustling lounge-like Izakaya. You can sit at the bar, the sushi bar, or at a high top where you order drinks and small Japanese plates to enjoy while a DJ spins. It's quite dark in here but not too loud and we enjoyed a leisurely meal here a lot. We started with a selection of grilled skewers which were very good and then moved onto some expertly fried Shrimp Tempura (plump juicy shrimp, lightly battered, not at all greasy). Next we shared a large sashimi plate which was very generous for the price, the fish and Octopus, were good quality and weren't served too chilled (over cold sushi is one of my pet hates!), we finished our meal with a couple of Yellowtail Hand Rolls which were excellent - well sized, containing a generous portion of large chunks of Yellowtail.There's a good variety of things to choose from on the menu, there's also a section featuring Udon and Ramen, and the food and drinks are all reasonably priced. It's a good spot for a romantic dinner for two but it is equally great for a bigger group as there should be something for everyone's taste on the menu, whether they are a seasoned sushi eater or a newcomer to Japanese cuisine. Service was pretty good and you can make reservations which may be a good idea at the weekends or for larger groups. All in all, if you want a fun night out with delicious food that won't cost you the earth I'd say Umami is well worth investigating."
"2.0","The fast food slow service of Mexican food.  The tacos had gristle so hard that I almost broke a tooth.  The tamales barely had any meat in them.  Black beans were good.  Cheap prices if you are on a budget.   If good food is what you are looking for, go spend your $$ somewhere else.   If you are on a budget, taco bell is better."
"5.0","Absolutely delicious.  The young man and young woman that waited in us provided one of the better dink g experiences I've had in a long time.  This might be one of the better meals I've had in the Pittsburgh area...all in a styrofoam container!  Meal #1 couple meats, some rice and salad.  Gyro meat was excellent and truly authentic.  Meatballs are turkey and beef, very flavorful and tender.  And the chicken was awesome as well.  Salad basic middle eastern salad.  White sauce...excellent. Hot sauce even better.   You pick whether you got or cold side.  Shredded beet salad was great.  A nice bite to it.  Basic but flavorful olives...and on the house.  This was an absolute Mecca of goodness and all in a styrofoam container.  All of this was suggested and prepared by the young gentleman that waited in us.  The pita gyro might have been one of the best. The wrap, although flavorful was there simply to hold together an absolute mound of gyro meat.  Adding white sauce and the hot sauce made it all the better.  Tres lesche cake.  Best I've ever had!  And the young man brought us soup on the house.  So simple, yet surprisingly flavorful.  This is an absolute must for any foodie out there!  Best Middle Eastern food in Pittsburgh and Cleveland, two cities which boast some pretty good food.  Thank you for a wonderful dining experience, plastic fork and all."
"4.0","We went here based on the recommendation of our shuttle driver, and I am glad we did.  The beer collection was quite extensive which was great for me because I am not typically a beer drinker but I do like some of the craft beer options.  They are a little on the pricey side, but most craft beer is. The food was a bit expensive but it was really good.  My salad was $18 but worth every cent.  The atmosphere was very upbeat.  It is loud like any sports bar atmosphere.  They were quite busy but it never felt crowded.  Service was good and the place was clean.  Next time I am in the area, I will definitely head back."
"4.0","Streets On Carson is a great addition to the South Side. I came for a quick breakfast before a day of drinking on Carson because I've heard great reviews. Unfortunately, only the breakfast menu was available to us at the time. I ordered the chilaquiles, and it was my first time having his dish. You can't really go wrong with breakfast nachos. Good portion and lots of flavor. I can't wait to come back here and try some other teams on the menu. Until next time!"
"2.0","This place used to be my absolute FAVORITE restaurant in Pittsburgh, maybe in the world. Unfortunately, that was a couple years ago, and Coca Cafe isn't quite the same anymore. What used to be a quaint eatery with friendly staff and amazing food has turned into a snobby, unwelcoming, poorly run establishment. Walking in on a weekend morning, it's generally busy. You put your name on a list and, if you're lucky, wait about 45 minutes to an hour. Get unlucky, and you might just be stuck with a wait time close to 2 hours. There is nowhere to wait, and you are sent half a mile down the street to the nearest coffee shop by a rude hostess who really couldn't care less about you. This is just the beginning. The most recent time I have been here, I was met with another 30 minute wait- until the waitress even noticed we were there. No water, coffee, menus...nothing. For half an hour. She finally found us, and did not apologize. In fact, my friends and I felt like we were bothering her by asking for drinks. We finally ordered, and waited AN HOUR for our french toast and eggs. When the food came it was soggy, not fresh, and frankly not of the quality I remember so fondly from a few years ago. By the end, we wanted nothing more than to get the hell out of there and pretend we didn't just overpay for crappy food and a disappointing experience."
"4.0","First time here. Its a small place but has a friendly atmosphere. I had a bowl of combo phő with beef, chicken and shrimp. It came out quick, tasted great and I left feeling better than when I came in."
"4.0","Best Indian food in Oakland area with reasonable price. What I like the most is that their buffet has tons of meat so i think it is decent. The taste is good in general. Instead of giving a five star, I think there is always improvement potential. I don't love this place crazily but definitely a great place to go sometime."
"5.0","We only bought the smoothies with bubbles and they were awesome. The tapioca was cooked perfectly. The woman helping us was very friendly and helpful. If we lived closer we'd be back to buy some chicken. I do wish the dining area was bigger."

We've been to 8 Latin American countries between the two of us and we both agree that Edgar's taco stand has the best tacos we've tasted. I recommend the chorizo. Oh, ad he has horchata! A must try for anyone who enjoys authentic foods."

There was a pizza place by PNC bank that I remember when  my going out days, but the pizza place change to Gennaro's so I saw on the wall how they have all these rewards so they must have good pizza i was like YES!!! Then man was I WRONG? big disappoint!  I must say for being a pizza place won these awards they must be the shit!!! So I didn't wait till I got home out of all fairness I had  to try it before I leave the parking lot. So 1 slice then 2  slice then by the time I got to the 3rd slice i was like REALLY??  This is what they were known for best pizza??? The sauce is to sweet for my taste bud and the dough had some sweet taste as well? I couldn't really taste the cheese to get the combination from the dough or the sauce,  big disappointment coming from these readers choice rewards good luck Gennaro's"
"5.0","Visited on the 4th of July- surprisingly it wasn't that crowded! This place can get really busy on weekends- hence why I haven't visited before. I went with a breakfast that included a blueberry ricotta pancake, potatoes, two over easy eggs, and bacon. It was absolutely delicious. The pancake was so flavorful and all of the food had that homemade with love kinda taste. MHM! I cannot wait to come back! Also, check out the awesome deck on the upper level of Cafe Raymond on a nice day!"

"4.0","Nice chilled place. Great attentive service and food (I came for breakfast, got the bagel) hit the spot. Nothing else needs to be said"
"5.0","Took a Yelp suggestion and gave this place a try ! We had the Pickle Brine fried chicken sandwich and a Mexican War burger.Yowza it was good stuff!! Thanks Yelp!!"
"3.0","So I was not happy that we ended up here but that quickly changed once I got my food. I'm a sucker for chicken fingers and they had the best honey mustard EVER!! And inexpensive as well. So if you in the Burgh and it's late and everything else is closed this wont disappoint."
"4.0","PERFECTLY NOT FANCY...great fries and sandwiches. GREAT Music playing (throwback ). Fun place to eat with our teens."
"5.0","During my second visit to Pittsburgh, I had to ensure I had breakfast at another Pamela's restaurant. Their food does not disappoint. It is a greasy spoon type of diner that you just know will be great. Their potatoes are just one reason to come back again and again."
"5.0","I'm moving to this neighborhood and this will be one of my new favorite spots! They have a great deli selection and you can buy some groceries as well. I got a Reuben sandwich and coffee, the sandwich was great. Can't wait to go back here!"
"5.0","This location is just like the others-pure perfection. Authentic, traditional Mexican food packed with goodness and flavor.Prices are very reasonable.Bea and her family are the best at what they do, and that's cooking with love.I've never had a less than perfect visit here or less than perfect food.Addicted to the tacos. All of them."
"5.0","My husband and I fell in love with this place at first sight!  We came to Morcilla after church on Sunday and arrived right as it opened, so it wasn't crowded at all.  We decided to eat at the bar because it looks welcoming and you get to watch the charcuterie preparations and cocktails.  Plus we like to talk to the bartender about his or her drink recommendations.The Ambiance:  I am a sucker for a well thought out restaurant and bar, and this place was well thought out to me.  You can visibly see their pieces of meat aging right before your eyes, but it isn't creepy or anything.  I really like their material selection from the tiles or hardwood on the floors to the wood/tile selection on the walls.  I could imagine myself in a restaurant in Europe.  It is legit.The drinks:  They have a nice drink selection.  I'm personally a HUGE gin fan, so when I heard they made their own tonic water I nearly jumped out of my seat to hug the bartender.  I appreciate fine taste!!!  I had the citadelle and it was floral goodness.  I also tried the botanist and it is my new favorite!!! Sweet and floral. My husband had a red sangria and it was probably the most potent sangria I've tasted.  It was REALLY good.  Apparently they have a red, white and rosé sangria option.  The bartender recommended the red and rosé. The food:   There were so many food options that we were interested in, and we have to go back to try more!  Because the list was so overwhelming, we decided to first try the 'All the Meats' charcuterie, and it was delicious!  We will be back!"
"5.0","Best soul food in pittsburgh straight-up.Cheap, delicious and fast.  The cornbread muffins are fire."
"4.0","Can a pizza have too much toppings? Holy bejesus these guys really piled it on my pie yesterday. The current carryout $10 any pizza ($2 for extra cheese or stuffed crust I found out) is a great bargain.I have to admit, the pepperoni lovers with Italian sausage and mushrooms pan pizza is too rich for me. I actually like bites of just cheese, sauce, and crust when I eat pizza. I am a big fan of the Papa John's down the street with the garlic dipping sauce, but if I am really hungry, this Pizza Hut is the deal.I ordered online by web because their iPad app didn't have the carryout deal or any other deals (click on deals and you get some message about everyday low pricing and no coupons needed #fail). It was piping hot when I got there to pick up 15 minutes later. Great counter service.Convenient parking lot behind the store. Carryout or delivery only. No seating."
"3.0","Pho is nice with rich soup. However, the soup is too sweet and the 'Fresh spring roll' was served cold, probably taken out of the fridge right after the order."
"5.0","Don't be deceived by the nondescript 'PAMELA'S RESTAURANT' sign in the sketchy font out front. The interior of this place is cozily modern, and the food is fantastic:- Home fries: cooked to a mealy perfection, then smashed before frying in order to maximize their crisp-able surface area. They must put some kind of cheese in them to get it that lovely golden brown color and perfectly crunchy texture. - Hotcakes: kind of like a thick crepe, but better. Each bite is different - sometimes sweet, sometimes a little saltier, fruitier, other times crunchier. Delicious every single time. - Omelettes: Their egg white omelettes do a great job posing as normal eggs. The fillings are fresh and flavorful without overpowering the flavor of the egg. - Toast: Yes, even their toast is excellent. Crisp on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. And their toast comes pre-buttered - taking care of that pesky cold-butter-on-hard-toast problem.It's greasy spoon brunch fare at its very best. My parents ate here two days in a row, which says a lot because they're Asians from Asia and typically don't like greasy American-style brunch foods. I'm an Asian from America and typically don't like to agree with my parents, but I'll make an exception for Pamela's. This place is amazing."
"5.0","Delicious korean fried chicken for a great price! My friends and I stopped by for lunch and all got the awesome lunch deal - $8.99 for milk tea, fries, and either 4 wings or 5 tenders. I got the wings with soy garlic sauce, which were very crispy yet tender, although they could probably use a tiny bit more sauce. The seasoned fries were also really well done and my friend enjoyed his sweet potato fries as well. I got taro for the milk tea, which I enjoyed and I like that you can customize how much sugar you want in it (less than half sugar is probably good). I got everything I wanted with the lunch deal for less than $10 (bubble tea AND chicken wings?!) and was definitely full after finishing everything. The shop owners/workers were also super nice and took time to explain the menu to us. The only thing is that our three orders probably took about 20-30 minutes to come out when we were the only customers present at the time (I could see them frying everything fresh in the kitchen) - we weren't in a rush or anything, but if we had been, I would have probably been more annoyed. So don't expect extremely fast service. Other than that, I highly recommend this place! :)"
"4.0","I pretty much lived on this stuff for a year. The service was always great and the prices are good. The veggie nachos are great, they load them up with queso. If you order chips & salsa you'll get a bag of chips so huge you won't be able to finish them."
"1.0","I was so disappointed in my food from Yuzu today. I always order the katsu curry and it has always been so good every time before this, but today was the worst. For one thing, it has always come with two chicken breasts, but today they skimped and only gave one chicken breast. If they are only going to give me half of the food, then they should also only charge half of the price. Instead, they still charged the full $13. Secondly, I'm not even sure if I can say what it came with was actually curry. It was so watery. Normally it is thick and has a lot of body, but today it was as thin and runny as oily water. I could be generous by giving two stars, considering my past experiences ordering this item was good, however, every bite was so thoroughly disappointing this time."
"4.0","I'm so excited that Freshii finally opened! It's a great alternative for anyone who is looking for a healthier lunch option outside of the typical fast food joints. You can choose from their signature salads, bowls, and wraps or build your own if you want something more customized.I ordered the market salad with tofu which was amazing. I would definitely recommend. All protein comes with an upcharge of a few dollars. All the ingredients are fresh and high quality. I'm obsessed with the honey dijon dressing. Portion sizes are reasonable, but I was hungry again soon after. The only downside is that their hours are very limited. They're only open until 5pm on weekdays and closed on weekends."
"4.0","B52 is a solid brunch spot. Pancakes are so good and the Za'tar bread is AM-AZ-ING. I also really like the lavender latte. Their chocolate chip cookies are also worth their weight in gold. One of my Pittsburgh favs."
"5.0","I just moved very close to Fazio's so I was hoping it would be a place I could rely upon for a good meal. It is! Very good Italian hoagies loaded with fixings, and good pizza. I haven't tried the steak sandwiches yet, but if the Italian hoagies are any indication, I bet I'll approve. The pizza crust is thin and crispy, and they used just the right amount of everything."
"4.0","Love going to the yard for bottomless mimosas on the weekend. They gave so many grilled cheese sandwiches to choose from and great brunch options as well. I most recently had the chicken waffle sliders. The chicken is fried in a sweet batter and has powdered sugar so the outside of it is like funnel cake from a carnival. They also have a Bloody Mary bar so you can make your own. There are plenty of beer options as well. I very much appreciate the great and friendly service. The manager stopped by everyone's table to check in. I definitely recommend checking it out for brunch!"
"5.0","Small but tasty place for breakfast.  Plan for a wait but service is good and fast.   Also, cash only!  'The morning after' is a good choice which is a sample of all breakfast foods."
"1.0","Just paid a visit Saturday evening after hearing about this place for almost a year. When we arrived, we got to be told to seat ourselves at the bar by a cold-faced waitress. The bartender didn't bother to serve, either. Instead, we had nice conversations with a random guy sitting next to us. We ended up with paying nearly 100 for two but won't come back since their business is too good to have two more of us. Also if you wanna have your mood ruined, go talk to the reception girl!"
"4.0","Great atmosphere tucked away in the South Side. Coffee is pretty good. Would definitely go back."
"5.0","best pizza on the south side since pizza sola closed...wish i had stopped here sooner...fantastic thin pizza, great sauce (right amount and i am so picky about too much sauce) not stingy with the cheese; and i loved putting the remainder of my slice in the brown bag  !!!"
"3.0","The ambiance and decor were both good. Trendy and chill. Our server was nice. The selections and prices were decent. My meal, unfortunately, was not very good. My coworkers and I each sampled a plate from the lunch menu. I got the vegetable one. It should have just said 'spinach' or 'greens' as those were the only veggies. I couldn't eat it and our server didn't notice or didn't care. The salad came with what tasted like grocery store Italian dressing! What! No. That doesn't seem very authentic to me. I got two samosas to go.... reheated in my oven that night and they were still tasty, so I'm glad my experience there ended on a positive note. But probably not positive enough for me to go back."
"5.0","This quaint little authentic old world Italian, out of the way, Gem of a restaurant in Shadyside on Copeland Street, is by far the best Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh. With  excellent food and service, you can't help but fall in love with this place as I have.The dishes are prepared with Italian love and care. The service is pleasant and cheerful. The decor and atmosphere invites a guest to stay as long as possible.  Although being a smaller restaurant they do fill up quickly, because of word of mouth popularity, and excellent food, so reservations are highly recommended. The food is well worth the wait on a long waiting list. The Gnocchi dish is to die for !!  They offer an excellent small wine list by the bottle. A few by the glass, but the bottle is so well worth it to complement any dish you choose. I am on the email newsletter list and keep up to date on all the specials and new menu's.  Adoro questo ristorante !!"
"5.0","I've been here a few times and have meaning to write a review on how delicious and satisfying the ramen is.  Next time I'm going to try to get something else other than ramen.  The cocktails are also fire.  I left feeling full (but in a healthy, light way) and wonderfully buzzed."
"5.0","I've had nothing but consistent and positive experiences at this local Turkish restaurant. This place first introduced me to the wonders of babaganoush, making it difficult to choose between this and their humus with bread. Their chicken kebab is classic, with tender juicy meat, seasoned to perfection. I love the grilled vegetables they include, especially the jalapeño pepper which gives everything a nice kiFriendly staff and I highly recommend coming here for dinner. Their baklava is authentic and delicious, recently tried their chocolate version of this classic dessert and love it!"
"5.0","The food here is delicious, the service is great, and the music/vibe is somehow relaxed and energizing at the same time.  Highly recommend."
"3.0","When I heard about these gourmet grilled cheese, I HAD to try The Yard! I think my expectations were a bit too high, which is why they fell short a bit. I was overwhelmed with the menu at first, but ended up going with what I came to get - The Mac Attack. When I saw it had bacon, I had to have it. I didn't know what 'lardons' were, so I asked our server and he replied 'little pieces of bacon'. Sold. I ordered that with crispy fries and a $3 glass of wine, nice. The rest of the table ordered and one of our friends also got the Mac Attack (another bacon lover!). It didn't take too long to come out and when it did I was so excited to try! I took my first bite and my taste buds were overly happy, but then slightly disappointed - no bacon. I asked the server if they forgot to put it in and he said 'no, it's cooked in bacon, but there isn't actually bacon'. What? Fifteen minutes ago you told me there were small pieces of bacon. Both my friend and I were extremely disappointed. Sans bacon, it was still delicious. This was a perfect grilled cheese to dip into the tomato soup. The fries however, eh. They are described as crispy, however mine were mostly made up of huge chunks of potatoes, so they weren't at all crispy. Dessert - huge disappointment. Creme brûlée is my favorite dessert and it just didn't do it for me at all. Maybe it was the white chocolate. S'mores fondue was bland and the graham crackers were stale. Prices aren't bad at all for the amount of food you get. I didn't mind the restaurant being in the basement and didn't feel it took away from anything. All in all, I still really enjoyed this restaurant and will definitely go back - way too many grilled cheeses to try!"
"4.0","Very good. I went with coworkers the day before thanksgiving. It was a Wednesday which is wing day - $12.99 for unlimited and they didn't skimp. It was no wait and food came out fast for a group of 8. One coworkers was a vegetarian and they were able to accommodate.It was fairly quiet inside during lunch. Could've been that many people took off from work that day. That made it easy to hear and quicker service. I enjoyed a bacon turkey wrap with fries. The portion of fries was on the smaller side but still seasoned well and tasted good. Overall very good- basically what I'd expect from a burger place with god service and i had no complaints at all."
"1.0","Went to have chat and the owner was too rude to tell us that he won't serve us only chat. He even told us to jus take away the chat and not sit on the table. I was really disappointed by the treatment."
"5.0","If I could give this place 6 stars, I would. This place is definitely within my top 5 favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. If you're deciding between this and another place, you probably want to go here. I've never been disappointed and I've been several times for dinner and brunch.My favorite dishes are below but don't let that stop you from trying other things too:- chicken liver mousse (dinner or brunch)- grilled hanger steak (dinner)- beef tartar (dinner or brunch)- tagliatelle (dinner)- rigatoni (brunch)"
"1.0","Terrible experience. Canceled order while it said it was en route for delivery. Do not use this place for delivery. Food is subpar at best."
"5.0","Excellent selection of coffee and my double shot of espresso was finished in 2 minutes flat. The espresso itself was very nice, smooth and not much bitterness at all, which was surprising. The food selection looked dynamite and I watched someone scarf down a sandwich and it looked delicious. This place was buzzing with locals and very dog friendly."
"3.0","Their chicken and wings are really good, but I've honestly thought about going to the one in Millvale due to the rude people who work here. I'm also pretty sure they are charging around $3 for delivery even if you are just a few blocks away, and it still takes an hour. Stick to pick up and brace yourself for a less than friendly experience. For anything other than the chicken or for faster/cheap delivery I stick with Ron's."
"5.0","I love this market because it's so convenient for us who live in Lawrenceville. They have so many options and phenomenal hours. The food is always fairly priced, and the staff is extremely friendly. If they were somehow able to start doing coffee/lattes as well, that would be a dream... Love supporting Lawrencevilles small businesses!"
"5.0","2 words- COLD ITALIAN! I have been getting these subs in front of the stadium for 3 years! They are awesome!"
"1.0","I have been to this place couple of times in the past. Earlier the food used to be great.But recently it seems the cook/cheif got changed and the food quality has detoriated since then. I ordered sadako pork and chicken and the food was super super spicy. There were red chilly powder and some chillies too all over the food. Momos also were not properly fried and the edges were uncooked."
"4.0","I've eaten at City Works twice for lunch during the week, and had great experiences both times. The first was with a large group, and the staff were friendly and helpful with accommodating us. We had our own little room! Each time, the food was delicious. I had the mac and cheese with chicken and bacon the first time, and the salmon the second. The mac and cheese was a huge portion, so I was hoping the pricier salmon would include enough for leftovers, but it did not. It was a delicious and healthy lunch portion. This is a great place for a large group during the day!"
"4.0","Came here for the lunch buffet- i had training for work in a hotel in Oakland. I saw the reviews here were astoundingly high- I had to come and check it out. I have a well developed pallet for Indian/Pakistani and all the food surrounding countries of this sort as my girlfriend is Pakistani and I have been trying authentic food for the last year or so. Bengal Kebab was a decent experience i came alone for the buffet which was $10, the selection was not massive and the experience was not 5 star but this Bangladeshi restaurant was a good 3.5 stars - I will round up to be kind. They had an array of masalas and curries with a salad bar. I would give it a B for cleanliness and decor and a B+ for service as the guy running the restaurant always made sure I stayed full on water. I didnt think to much of the dishes with chicken or the plain vegetable curries- there was one curry that really danced well with my taste buds it was the Moat Curry or something like that, it consisted of curry, sweet peas, and cubes of cheese (paneer) i believe. It was very good. I would imagine the dishes you get here when the lunch buffet is not active are much tastier. It is halal if you are a abiding muslim, and it tastes pretty good. I would return."
"5.0","Best indian food in pittsburgh..have been eating here for three years....have not been disappointed even once..the flavors are authentic.."
"4.0","Following a tradition of trying new restos when D&k are in town, we picked umami.    Everything we ordered was solid and in the end pretty reasonably priced for how full we were.  Keep in mind that these are tapas style for sharing and they bring them to you as they are ready.   Check out my pics for the portions -things that stood out where the octopus balls (like conch fritters), melt in your mouth sushi options, and the miso ramen that's big enough to share.   My issues with the place were 1-it was hot, we ended up opening an unscreened window for a breeze; 2- for whatever reason, the night we went...they varied between elevator techno music and straight on techno and the speakers were directly overhead.   We will probably come back on special occasions."
"4.0","Quality Chinese food and very nice atmosphere for a Chinese restaurant. Two knocks in my opinion. A little pricey and do not openly ask if you want a soft drink. They give you tea and water, which is fine and healthier, but if I'm getting Chinese then more than likely I decided to forego eating healthy.I typically get the General Tso Chicken or Shrimp Fried Rice.On a side note: Best Eggrolls in the city by far."
"5.0","One of the best steaks in the city! I cane here following our small family wedding. Maria, our waitress, was absolutely wonderful. She made us feel very welcome, and addressed us as the 'the new wife and groom.' The steaks were better than any I have had in the city so far (and much better than Morton's). All the filets and NY strips were cooked to the perfect temperature and the sides (asparagus and potatoes ) were top notch.When we thought we were done with out meal, Maria brought us out a congratulatory desert of cheesecake and espresso cake. I think that night I was still dreaming about the cheesecake!Then, the final touch, As we were about to leave Maria again congratulated us, and gave my beautiful wife a fresh rose. I have never seen service so good it brought my new wife to tears until last night.This is an expensive treat, but you get what you pay for. Maria, I hope you see this, or someone mentions it to you. You made our unorthodox wedding day very special, and we will be back to see you soon"
"4.0","Girasole is nestled in a small space on a side street in Shadyside. When you walk in, you find a bustling space full of excellent smells and people crowded together enjoying authentic Italian food. The food was excellent, homemade and served in timely manner. The waiter was super friendly and made sure we were happy and had everything we needed. The only negative is that we were in the last table before the kitchen which meant we were essentially in the galley way for the servers. It was loud, really loud not the best ambiance, but the food was great and made up for the not so great table."
"5.0","AWESOME all day buffet for an affordable price! Its made with love too; They don't skimp on the quality like some other buffets. They always have the Indian favorites, tikka masala, saag paneer, and if you're VEGAN, you'll probably fall in love. They offer so many vegan options. A+"
"4.0","We had not planned to have dinner there, but it was an on-the-spot choice and we did not regret it! Actually we enjoyed it.  The establishment is a nice small place, that gives you the (right) impression that people will take care of you.  The food was amazing.  The Gouda appetizer was a delicious choice and so was the hanger stake. Cooked to perfection.  I think it will become an often visit for me :)"
"2.0","The chips and guacamole/salsa are not free, the waiter charge $2.50 for the chips and salsa and then $3.50 for the guacamole. It was disappointing since both the salsa and guacamole tasted mediocre.I ordered a frozen margarita that was more poorly mixed than one I ordered a month ago. My meal was extremely 'wet' for lack of a better word. I had a spicy Mahi Mahi dish, which was ok, but not great."
"2.0","First and last time.  We waited an excessive amount of time to give initial orders.  The place was nearly empty, maybe 5 tables of people. It took about 20 minutes for the waitress to bring us our drinks. She initially had us waiting just to come back after so long to say that the beer we ordered was not available.  I asked for a sample of the cider and the waitress dropped it off and never came back until after we were finished eating to ask if I liked it.  She did sit down and explain that she was the the only one working the patio which was considerate, however, unless she was busy somewhere else I did not see her tending to other customers enough to justify our wait time."
"4.0","Cute spot that is tucked away on Ivy Street, off of Walnut, with a patio which was perfect for the warm Spring night I had gone. The lights and the quietness felt like we were in another world. We brought wine and I had the beef/lamb kefteas and my husband had the chicken kebab. Everything tasted great and portions were good though I will say for roasted vegetables that accompanied our proteins included grilled jalapeno which lucky for me my husband took a big bite first! Service was friendly and nice. A little more pricier than other Mediterranean places in the area however worth it for the ambience. We'll be back!"
"1.0","I asked for my coat back, because the bartenders and waitresses told me in the beginning of the night that they would hold it. When I asked for it back, they told me they didn't have it and didn't know where it was for 5/10 minutes all of a sudden when I started asking more questions and spoke with the 'managers' my Coat appeared. Moreover, they then proceeded to tell me I had to leave the 'bar' and pushed me out!"
"5.0","Great place.  Was craving something fresh and healthy, and this place popped up.  Wellll, alrighty then!  Had a green juice.  They pre-make them (but they aren't old), which is nice because you don't have to wait nine hours for a juice to appear and get in your belly.  Also had the lemongrass soup with vegan broth and tofu.  Had rice noodles and plenty of veggies.  Quite tasty and had a nice spice level.  Added some sriracha for extra oomph.  Was very filling, but calories were actually pretty low--like 500 for everything.  Price was maybe $14 for everything.  Not bad, you can go broke buying kale juice.  Would definitely return."
"5.0","This. Place. Is. Awesome.  I've been here several times and it has never disappointed.  This place is as authentic Mexican as it gets in Pittsburgh.  I'll admit I've only ever ordered a variety of their taco selections but that is because they are so incredibly delicious.  I love the Filet Mango Tacos as well as the fish tacos.  All their ingredients taste so fresh and love their combination of sauces and spices.  Their salsa is not my favorite, but the queso and guac are quite tasty and flavorful.  I believe another true sign of a great Mexican restaurant is if their rice and beans measure up - they do here.  The authentic Mexican cheese on the beans...so yummy.  I do like the margaritas, but don't ever drink more than two!  They are uber strong!Bonus - family friendly.  They have high chairs.  :)"
"3.0","I felt the attitude of the staff could have been a lot better.  If I smile at you I would appreciate very much to have a smile returned.  I am very smiley person especially when I am in line to order fried chicken  but the cashier turned my smile upside down by frowning at me."
"4.0","I've never been to the actually location but the delivery is great!! They are so fast from the placing of the order to my door. There pepperoni rolls are one of the best things one the menu and their cheese pizza is so simple yet amazing!!"
"2.0","Went in to celebrate nieces 21st birthday and have a couple drinks. Place was busy for a Sunday night filled with young college students. It was entertaining to watch the drunk kids flirting among each other. Service was ok once they acknowledged you. I had a beer which was fine but family members had mixed drinks. Glasses were not clean, poor drink quality but not sure what we should have expected from a place filled with college kids. Cleanliness was ok and the staff was friendly. Prices were a little on the high end especially with the poor drink quality. Do not plan to return and don't recommend."
"4.0","After waiting for a while in a fast paced line, we ordered Kufta and Lamb Shank for the main course and Pistachio Bird Nest for dessert. The food was delicious. The portions were huge. Kufta was too spicy. I like spicy food. However, I think that a restaurant should mention on the menu when a dish is more spicy than would be expected. This is the reason that I deducted one star. The service was good and fast. Of course, considering the self-service nature of the place and especially this very fact that no tips are asked or expected. Certainly, this place is not a good place for a date or sentimental meeting. But a good place if you just want to try a huge middle eastern meal with a decent cost."
"5.0","This place is amazing. I was recently here and started with the bread and butter. What is in the butter. Oh my god. Delicious. The bread was incredible. We also got the bruschetta which was not traditional but amazing. I had the risotto and honestly dream about it. Not your usual take on risotto. Everyone else had pizza and they loved it. It was a great meal. Our server was a darling!"
"3.0","Hambone's appears to be just another yinzer bar in Pittsburgh. However, you'll see upon entering that the ladies behind the bar are actually very nice and accommodating and their menu is relatively extensive and delicious.I first went to Hamebone's to drink and was blown away by how attentive the bartender was. She actually came outside (where we decided to sit) and asked us if we needed anything. Very nice, considering she had plenty of business at the counter and could have let us go up when we needed something.The second time was with my neighbor, Tate. He's been in Lawrenceville for over 20 years and personally knows the cook at Hambone's. He talked the place up quite a bit and we finally made it over one afternoon for lunch. It was, quite surprisingly, incredibly good.I've been to Hambone's for dinner as well with Tate and was equally impressed.Don't judge a book by its cover, Hambone's has a lot going on."
"1.0","Came in here on Wednesday with a friend and we sat at the bar. Took 5 minutes of the female bartender walking back and forth washing dishes. We heard her talking to the person next to us and she seemed extremely annoyed and was actually rude to the customer. She then after a while put menus in front of us. Around 5 min later she came back and there was a beer on tap neither of us had had so we got one sample. The beer was warm and tasted funny. She didn't come back to see how the sample was for 10 minutes. The bar was really busy but she wasn't paying attention to ANYONE. Customers were all looking at each other like WTF?! While this bartender was in her own little world... We wanted to get drinks and food but after waiting for 10 or 15 minutes we decided to leave and go next door to Industry. My biggest piece of advice is for management to go back on cameras and observe how many customers came in and left due to this bartender because we definitely weren't the only ones. Very disappointing."
"5.0","One of the best bars in Pittsburgh! It's my favorite place to go in summer. The crowd is great and it's really good for office happy hours. It's one of the rare pubs in Pittsburgh that people dress up a little :)"
"2.0","Do not order online!Excited by the reviews here, I placed an order on EatStreet. I arrived at the restaurant about 35 minutes after placing the order (the system quoted a 20min prep time). However, when I got there they did not recognize my name and tried to take a new order down. I finally noticed a ticket on the counter with my phone number on it, so I pointed to it. They then told me '20 minutes' and walked away. They had not even sent the order to the kitchen to be prepared! When I complained, they pointed to the fax machine and told me it was broken, and that they aren't taking online orders. Even so, their website and accounts are still active. A full hour after leaving work I got home with my food. I'd hate to see what happens with phone orders given how difficult it was to communicate when in person.The food was actually pretty good, though that might have been influenced by my hunger after waiting so long. The biryani was definitely more Bangladeshi, which was really nice to have. I enjoyed the curry I ordered, though it was a bit thinner than I am used to. I would usually be happy to go back based on the food and prices. However, thanks to the abysmal customer service I won't be going back any time soon."
"5.0","Best dining experience I've had in Pittsburgh. The inside is quaint and a bit small, and it's nice being in a place where the waiters are attentive and it's not crazy hectic. Make sure to go online to make a reservation.We started with the beef crudo (tartare) and it was simply fantastic. Next up they brought out the cecina and warm bread and olive oil. The cecina was sweet and complimented nicely by the smoked shallot. Next up was the octopus a la plancha. Wish I had octopus before so I had something to compare it to, but I can say it was decent. The meat was pretty tough (again, not sure if that is how good octopus is supposed to be) and it was served with an overwhelming amount of the sesame yogurt. I suggest eating the yogurt separately so you can enjoy the octopus more. The chickpeas that came with it were excellent as well.Lastly, they brought out the castillas de mantanza which are the baby back pork ribs. Sweet and tangy, these were simply delicious. In addition, we enjoyed the morcilla sausage, which were soft and savory. Cough up the money and come here to really enjoy some fine dining. We tossed the idea around of getting a large plate, but ultimately decided on doing a few of the small plates just so we can taste a lot more. Apparently the chef specializes in the charcuterie, so I would recommend getting one or two of those meats."
"5.0","Not gonna lie, this sandwich was a little hard to eat given how big it was but definitely tasted pretty good. Chicken wasn't dry even tho I took it togo and ate it a few hours later. The sauce for the chicken tenders was different, but pretty good too."
"3.0","Let it be known that I am the biggest Bruegger's fan ever.  I've been a pretty steady once-a-weeker since childhood.After all that...This is the worst Bruegger's ever.  I always think: Oh, I'm close by and it'll be fine this time.  Nope.  The staff is awful.  The bagel are stale.  The staff is so awful they don't know that the bagels are stale.Protect your brand, Bruegger's, and get a new staff for this location."
"4.0","Solid 4 stars. Never disappointed at a Capital Grill. 2nd time. 1st was in Sarasota, FL. Tonight was great. My son and daughter in Law treated us. We did make early reservations for 3:30pm. With extra traffic we called and let them know we were running 15 minutes behind schedule. They were more than gracious. Seated quickly. Both servers were extremely attentive and experienced. Food was excellent and prepared exactly as ordered. No room for dessert. Great for adults, leave the kids at home for this stop."
"1.0","We were the only people in the place around 5pm, so that should have been a clue.  The service was mediocre at best and they acted like we were inconveniencing them by being there.  We ordered the clam chowder first to determine if we would order food.  So glad we did because it saved us from ordering a meal.  The clam chowder was watery and had no clams at all in it (or maybe minuscule pieces that we couldn't find).  It was like a bad version of potato soup.  Not realizing that they were related, we went to the popup Christmas bar next door.  What an absolute rip off! It was $22 for a well drink and a beer.  The music was ridiculously loud, and again, we were the only ones in there. I should have trusted my gut and gone somewhere that had customers."
"5.0","Great food! Their samosas are to die for and they always have a great selection of sauces and dips. Fun atmosphere and homey environment. Will definitely visit again!"
"2.0","Don't order the mussels. Undercooked and some just didn't taste right. However, service was good and prompt. I ordered the salmon, it was interesting. Probably won't be returning."
"3.0","Gotta say... a bit disappointed.  Some things were really good and others were confusingly off-tasting.  I'm not a big IPA girl, so there weren't a lot of beer choices for me and the milk stout was okay.  The chicharrones were good but the beer cheese tasted off.  We got the buffalo chicken rillettes and we joked that it looked like cat food and the bread was burnt on the edges.  (we did like the pickled celery that came with it though!)  The pierogis were real good, but the 'goat cheese' (which looked and tasted a LOT like the beer cheese) didn't taste that great. lastly, we got the cookie plate- two of the cookies were divine and the third one tasted like someone added a wrong ingredient.  It seems like others like it, but there were far too many things that tasted off for such a high price, imo."
"5.0","I decided to check this place out since it has been a while since I've been on the North-side. There is street parking along with a parking lot on a diagonol behind it. All parking is metered wherever you park.Came inside. The atmosphere was 'homey' with wooden tables and chairs. In an adjacent room there is a sofa and table to relax. The place wasn't at all busy for lunch so I decided to order the pear arugula salad. I asked the counter person regarding getting a cold tea since it was an unusually warm day. She told me that all of their teas can be made cold upon request. There was one that interested me which was called 'Peach apple cobbler tea.' I asked about it and was told  that it has that flavor to it along with cider mixed in. Seeing fall had arrived I opted for that one.She also explained to me that my salad would come with bacon, pecans, and Gorgonzola cheese which I said was fine. The dressing used is a pear vinaigrette that also contains the same cheese. I went to sit down to wait for my order and observed that they have takeout, a wall full of various teas and huge desserts or pastries available for purchase.Finally she explained that they have a reward program via Perka where if you purchase a total of 6 teas then your 7th one would be free. This is a good reward program for anyone who frequents the place.I got my salad and it was indeed delicious! I had ordered the large size of the cobbler tea and found it just as good with enough cider in it that I didn't need any added sugar. They also specialize in peach lemonades for cold drinks and have a great assortment. The salad was served on a regular dish along with an actual fork and knife on a tray. Once finished there is an area where you can throw away your trash and place the tray and utensil as well as the dish in a separate area.Prices are reasonable whether you are ordering a salad, sandwich, or pastry to go with your tea of choice. This place is another neighborhood gem. It sits close to Allegheny General hospital on East Ohio St so it is best to come in the off hours. Am looking forward to my next visit to try a hot tea and perhaps one of their pastries."
"2.0","Overrated. Food was interesting and tasty, but arrived at the table an hour after we ordered. Insanely loud noise level. As long as the wait for food was, I was never offered more coffee. Not worth it IMO."
"5.0","Located at the far end of the strip district. They have a small parking lot next to the market. If you're going for lunch I would suggest going before noon or else there is a huge line. The portions are big enough for 2-3 meals and the staff is super friendly. But most importantly, the food tastes good! I ordered rice, chicken tikka masala, saag paneer, naan, a veggie samosa and a bottle of water and it came out to $14. The samosa was the best that I ever had and I went home with enough left overs to last me at least a second meal."
"5.0","Great place. Don't be an ass like me and go straight for DAMN HOT. I proceeded to trip balls on a psychedelic level, full of regret and stomach cramps. No joke, this was the hottest thing I ever ate. Will return for more chicken, just down a peg or two on the hot scale."
"4.0","Sammy's is a place with lots of tradition. This is their original location. They know how to make a classic Corned Beef Sandwich and they make it well. They pile their sandwiches high, and they are made to order. All the ingredients are fresh. Service is fast and courteous. You order in the back, then pickup at the cashier. I've been eating hear for more than 20 years, this place is dependably good."
"5.0","My wife and I recently got back from our honeymoon in Thailand and stopped in on a random Saturday night. I'd previously researched the restaurant and was interested in their street food concept. The atmosphere was unique with the Southside street signs posted around the restaurant. I ordered the Roast Pork Broccoli Rabe and my wife ordered the jerk chicken skewers. The roast pork was fantastic. It was perfectly seasoned along with the broccoli and it paired well with its crusty roll. My wife also enjoyed her jerk chicken along with her rice and peas. She agreed that it was quite comparable to authentic Jamaican food. We'll definitely be back!"
"5.0","Incredible food!!! We had the waitress pick our dishes and she nailed it. She was extremely food woke. Did not disappoint."
"5.0","I had the best meal that I've had in a long time here last night.  Pro-tip, ask the waiter what the more adventurous items on the menu are.  I almost got a rather basic dish but was encouraged to try more.  So glad I did!  My pork dish was a deconstruction on an old classic- perfectly cooked with a cannelloni that had some sort of mashed potato esque filling, and a molasses shatter on top that was reminiscent of applesauce just kicked up to 11.  The drinks were perfect!  Don't let the rather been-done decor or branding fool you, this place is legit.  Hoping someone sees this review and hires a better decorator and brand manager, the chef deserves better!"
"5.0","The food is excellent! It was fresh, hot, and yummy! Coffee is good too. Highly recommended."
"4.0","i love the style of this diner! you get there and stand in line to order (the menu is big on the wall but they also have physical menus at the counter you can grab while in line if you can't see or want more time to look at it) they have a nice lunch and breakfast menu. i've had an omelette and a two egg breakfast on separate visits and my boyfriend got the turkey gouda wrap (i forget the exact name). the omelette and eggs (overeats) were both so so.. they weren't bad but nothing to write home about. the bacon is super greasy and not really crispy (i like my really crispy) but the potatoes were awesome! my favorite thing both times i went haha. my boyfriend loved his wrap! he said it was really good but a little spicy! (he liked but i know some people don't like spicy and he wasn't expecting it to be).. i always get the coffee when i'm there and it's okay too a again nothing to write home about. overall though i love the place and have already been there a few times"
"3.0","Went here on a Friday with a group of people.  The staff was very friendly.  Even the girls eating their shift meal stopped to say hi.  The overall atmosphere was great and I really enjoyed being there.  The issue I had was with the food and that seemed to be the consensus of the group I was with.  I got the Calamari Fritti, a guy in my group got the Chicken Parm, and another got the Tortellini Verde.  We all agreed that the food was kind of bland.  The guy with the tortellini said the noodle itself was good but the sauce was disappointing.  The calamari on my fritti was cooked well but again the batter was bland.  The sauce on the dish was marinara but to me it just seemed like unseasoned diced tomatoes.  I'm definitely willing to give this place another chance.  Another guy in the group had the lobster ravioli and said it was good so it's possible some things on the menu are just better than others"
"4.0","Food was great. Service was so so. We were there around 10:00pm and wanted to order dessert but apparently they switch to late night menu at 11 and we had no idea. Very unfortunate."
"4.0","Food truck this time and still Good Tacos.  The food truck was nearby and decided to give it a try.  Tacos were $4, so a little more expensive.  Had the Carnitas with mexican slaw, pico de gallo, cilantro and lime and the Carne Molida, a spicy beef with sauteed bell peppers, jalpenas, farmers cheese, cilantro and lime.  Both were good.  There were a variety of hot sauces available including a Sirachi Bacon that was very interesting and had some heat."
"5.0","So good!Best lunch in the city, and crazy affordable. Be sure to try the plantains!"
"3.0","This is my first time here. I came with my colleagues on team lunch. We ordered Lamb with rice and salad. Taste was good and yah we really got satisfied with the taste. Price was reasonable. I would suggest the restaurant guys to serve a little more hot food than right now. The hot food will taste yummy and satisfying when they eat according to my opinion. Check the picture which I ordered. Whenever you're here try this restaurant for sure. Everyone who's serving is kind and friendly."
"5.0","Being a Steelers Fan of course we had to try this place. We tried once before after a game and that was an error. The wait was longer than the Wall of China. So on another trip we came on a random day. There wasn't much of a wait (I think I used No Wait App). The place was still a little crowded but nothing too bad. The food was good and I decided to try something different - I did the fried burger (I know sounds crazy, right). The entire burger is fried. It was surprisedly good. The drinks could be a little better. Our waiter was amazing and was able to handle being seated back to back like a pro."
"3.0","Pro: Filet mignon is amazing Con: Stuffy environment"
"2.0","CASH ONLY! Stopped for lunch on a visit to Pittsburgh and wasn't impressed. The fish and chips were decent and hot out of the fryer, but I didn't like the calamari breading or lack of tentacles with the bodies. I also had to change my son's diaper, and we were told we couldn't do it in the bathrooms (no changing tables), but our waitress cleared chairs off an unused table and said she let patrons change their kids that way all the time. We have a changing pad and I assume they wipe the tables down, but still...invest in a changing table and stop letting people put their kid's asses where we eat. I then tied and sealed the diaper in a plastic bag we carry for that purpose and tossed it in the trash. The waitress was then upset because 'it would be there for days.' Ok, well, take your trash out more often? You do scrape food into that barrel, do you not? I assume several days of rotting food you haven't removed smells worse than a contained pissy diaper? Hard pass on coming back here."
"5.0","SO. GOOD.My bestie & I have been looking for a solid vegan place in the Burgh and this is it!  It is a small place with a fun atmosphere. Metal guitar music playing inside, but not loud at all!I got the Asian buns & the poutine tots. Both were insanely incredible. I myself do not typically eat vegan, and was a little nervous that I wouldn't like a full vegan meal, but everything was absolutely delicious! I am easily dragging more people here, vegan or not. Onion Maiden provides a fun, unique culinary experience at awesome prices!I will be back! Tomorrow!"
"4.0","I'd give a 4.5 if I can. This place is not at the best location but they do some serious Japanese food! For apps, we ordered the Karaage and the grilled King mackerel. There are four pieces perfectly fried chicken thigh in one order of Karaage. As a decent Japanese restaurant  should present, the flavorful juice exploded with each bite of the Karaage! The grilled mackerel is good, too, yet a little salty to my like.For entree we had the sukiyaki. And it was amazing!! The soup is so much more than normal sukiyaki sauce or ponzu sauce. As the soup starts boiling and the vegetables start melting, the unique taste of shiitake mushrooms, the sweetness of carrots and the spiciness of onions and green onions mix together to generate a rich flavor. In this delicious soup base you cook the thin beef slices and dip them in the egg sauce for a very tender texture. They just melt in your mouth! I'll definitely come again for the sukiyaki!For drinks, I had a Kiku punch which is quite light and sweet. My friend had the green tea, which is also pretty good."
"5.0","Yes, this restaurant is as good as it gets!   This is not your run of the mill, saucy, cheesy laden Italian fare.  NO, this is classic and clean.  The ambiance reminded me of a little trattoria in Florence.  Tiny with warm brick walls and air filled with great aroma's that would remind you of being in Nonna's kitchen.My mother and I were visiting my daughter who is attending college in Pittsburgh.  We arrived from NJ late but wanted a very nice dinner.I remember Girasole from another time I visited the city but didn't have the opportunity then.  Too bad really, I've been missing out all this time.When we arrived, the nice lady took our name and said it was going to be a little while for us to be seated.  There was no wait, it was immediate!It was so busy in the restaurant but the lovely ladies who served us made the time to be extremely pleasant and attentive.  We first ordered the Antipasto, it was great with prosciutto, soppressata, cheeses, grilled artichokes, olives and roasted tomatoes.  Mom and I ordered their Linguine Rustic and my daughter had the Gnocchi.  OMG, I have had linguine in clam sauce before, but NOT like this.  It was homemade pasta with so many clams in a wonderfully light clam sauce/both.  I tasted the Gnocchi and they were like little pillows of air.  We enjoyed our dinner so much that we decided to make reservations for the next night (Good Friday)On Friday we got there a little earlier than our reservations, but no problem we were seated immediately.  Our first course was the bruschetta with ricotta, mint pesto, buttery pine nuts and grilled artichoke.  It was a great start.  My daughter and I ordered the Mushroom soup, it was so delicious I really wanted to order a container to take with me.  It was full of mushrooms and a hint of white wine and parmesan cheese.  We all ordered the scallops, mom and I had it with the polenta, my daughter does not like polenta and the waitress advised they are accommodating and changed it out for the gnocchi.  Well, this dish did not disappoint at all, buttery, sweet and tender large sea scallops over creamy, cheesy polenta and topped with spicy arugula.  This is a dish that I will definitely be returning for.The owner was so sweet both nights giving us a plate of home roasted peppers.  Yummm is all I can say!!!Next time in Pittsburgh this will be my go to place for wonderful Italian food.Thank you, Girasole for make our weekend memorable.Lisa"
"4.0","The food here was very unique for 'ramen house'. My friend and I got the cauliflower, eggplant and meat bun to start. The cauliflower I didn't really enjoy as I didn't think it had a lot of flavor but everything else including the ramen was great. I liked how you were able to customize your ramen to what you want to add in and take off the premade menu"
"5.0","Chinatown Inn is great! Service is great and the food is amazing! The atmosphere is very relaxed. I love eating at the restaurant more than when we have ordered take out..it just tastes better when you eat at the actual restaurant! The prices are affordable, and they offer a giant eggroll as well as a normal sized one! Everyone should support this Chinese restaurant, especially if  you want quality food!"
"1.0","I usually love Pizza Hut, but after visiting family members, I have a different opinion.We ordered online. We ordered a custom pizza. It took really long for them to deliver it considering it was pretty close... When we got the pizza, almost every thing was wrong.Wrong crust, wrong sauce, wrong toppings.We were a little disappointed over how long it took to get the pizza, but even more disappointed about how the order was completely messed up."
"5.0","Definitely one of the best dining experiences ever. Between the atmosphere and the impeccable service, not to mention the delicious food. I recommend the scallops and asparagus risotto for this season. From start to finish everything was excellent. This would be a great place for a special birthday or an anniversary."
"4.0","Solid four stars.  Nothing is perfect, but it's fast, cheap, and delicious."
"3.0","Went to CW yesterday.  Got in before the Pride Day parade finished but they were still busy.  The restaurant didn't staff appropriately considering the parade and the Arts Festival.Getting drinks took a long time and 1 person in our group got the wrong order.Food was tasty, but again a bit slow out of the kitchen.Not a bad restaurant, but the copper table tops make your hands smell.Overall, average especially considering it was $70 for 2 people."
"4.0","This is the place to go for fresh Ramen in the Burg! I had the inferno ramen bowl  it did not disappoint. The noodles were cooked perfectly the fried chicken skin had so much flavor and the soft boiled egg was an added bonus. Also had the pork belly Bao...Such a treat! The bun was soft and fluffy the pork belly was perfectly cooked. A full bar compliments this restaurant... Prices are right. Definitely going back."
"5.0","I still dream about their croissants! So flaky and crisp. The best croissants I've had in the area."
"3.0","I finally made it to City Works to actually try the food. We settled on city works because we could not validate being inside on such a beautiful evening. Atmosphere and setting: City Works is a 5. It's a great place to sit outside and enjoy the great weather. It was 8 pm on a Thursday so there was a decent amount of people that had the same idea but it was not overly crowded.  As long as you are not in a rush, this is a great space to be on a nice day. Food and drinks: Our waiter recommended we try the veggie burger and man was he spot on. Their veggie burger does not taste like a veggie burger, it does not have the texture of a veggie burger. It was so good (once it actually came out from the kitchen). I understand why they trademarked this burger. Highly suggest trying this, even if you are not a vegetarian.  It is worth it and quite interesting. Also, there is a crazy amount of beers and wines on tap to choose from. However, we were 'those people' that opted for markers manhattan's because it was just a liquor night over beer. Service: This is where City Works just drops the ball. Our waiter was so nice and enjoyable to speak with and we felt very welcomed in the beginning. However, we had to have waited at least 30 min+ for our food and I realize that is not his fault, but in that time we also finished our first round of Manhattans and as our drinks were getting low we were never asked if we wanted another round etc. When our food did come, we actually had to get up and go grab napkins and utensils from another table.  We also were waiting around for quite a while for our waiter to come back to give the bill. It seems this is a trend at City Works and that's kind of a bummer because the atmosphere and drinks are there. . . just get on top of a kitchen and staff's attentiveness and I think you will see an increase in the ratings."
"5.0","Everything starts with the service. Our waitress was phenomenal.  We had a party of 9 and she tended to our very needs. She explained the menu throughly and made our time there worth the while. The food was amazing. Everything was freshly made and seasoned.  Yes, the prices are extreme, but you definitely get what you pay for. I highly recommend this place for a fancy evening for your loved one."
"4.0","From Chicago with Love!! Was here last weekend on a business trip (on a Friday) and man, this placing was JUMPIN! Good times no doubt I'll be back when in Pittsburgh!!"
"2.0","I've gotten delivery from here twice. First time I just ordered a few different, nothing-fancy, pizzas. They were completely acceptable. Nothing spectacular, but no complaints. Second time I ordered a pierogi pizza and a calzone. They were not so good. I wasn't expecting to blown away based on the first pizza experience, but I was expecting acceptable. The pierogi pizza was bland & the calzone was a yucky, sloppy, goopy, bland, mess. Also, delivery guy #2 was a complete ass - no need to call me & force me to run for my phone when I'm standing at my door and I could hear your car coming from a block away. I won't order from them again. I might check out the place to dine-in and see if those breadsticks are all they're cracked up to be. Until then, two stars. Very disappointing."
"4.0","This is a solid place for a casual night out. I came here with my husband on a Friday night and this place was packed. We were seated in the back room which was full and while I loved the aesthetic of the big open room, it was very loud and difficult to have a conversation. The menu is limited but everything on it sounds amazing. I decided to go with the fried chicken sandwich and my husband ordered the soft shell crab. One of the reasons we chose to come here is that it's so rare to see a restaurant offer soft shell crab around here! We both enjoyed our sandwiches but were a little disappointed by the fries. I love shoestring fries but these were lacking crunch and flavor. As far as beer, I tried both the saison and chai beer. I found them to be just okay, but did appreciate how unique the beer offerings were and would definitely come back when they rotate their selection. Overall, I'd give this place a 3.5/5. Has potential to be exceptional, but as it is, it's just okay."
"4.0","Walked in on a Sunday around 2pm for brunch. There were approx. 4 parties ahead of us, but we decided to wait the estimated 25 minutes. The hostess was extremely friendly and thanked some parties for continuing to wait. About 35 minutes later, we were seated at a table for two. My husband enjoyed the lemon kombucha drink and our waitress even gave us a taste of the cherry vanilla. They were both refreshing, but I enjoyed the lemon better. Oh, avocado toast. Where have you been all my life? Lemony, tahini-flavored, and just enough texture from the black sesame scattered top, we ordered another round (which they forgot to serve, but voluntarily took off our bill as a result). I just could not help myself. Next the lentil soup came out, orangey-red in color, which had hints of curry and small chunks of lemon zest at the bottom. The lemon was such an unexpected touch and a surprising treat, as I neared the end of my bowl. I particularly enjoyed the parsley garnish, which contrasted well with the rest of the soup's flavors. Out came our onion flatbreads. Now all of you 'onion-heads' like myself have something to look forward to. Flavorful and cut into four, I very much enjoyed every bite. I thought maybe a base spread would have paired well on this flatbread, but I scarfed it down nonetheless. My husband also ordered the potato cakes, which were flattened and crisp. He RAVED about the tahini dipping sauce (which I might have to learn how to make, if I know what's good for me). I personally enjoyed it, but thought some fresh garlic/some other fresh spice would have enhanced its flavors a bit more. Service was good and and all wait staff were friendly, although we had two servers for most of the experience, due to high crowd numbers. If you end up coming for brunch, the lot just past the cafe is free on Sundays.  I am so looking forward to returning- and hopefully next time will save room for their tempting desserts!"
"5.0","This is my favorite seafood spot in Pittsburgh. Reasonably priced, great service, and the food is SO good. I have yet to go to a seafood restaurant in Pittsburgh that beats the pricing and quality!"
"4.0","This location even though it is usually very busy, the staff is friendly and fast. I visit this location at least three times a week and usually my experience for bagel breakfast or pick two lunch is very good . Just a few times , mainly in the weekends I have come across some not well baked bagels ."
"1.0","Perhaps I hated Mario's because I am older than 22 or perhaps it is because I felt like a pin ball being shoved between dude after dude.  It also could have been the Philly in me not being able to relax in a bar that has large stained glass windows dedicated to Pittsburgh Sports (I felt like I was behind enemy lines).  Either way, the cheap beer was not enough to woo me into liking Mario's.  The music was too random to be ironic.  I am not good at math, but I do know that the ratio here of dudes to girls = sausage fest.We had one beer here and it took all my might to not throw some 'bows."
"5.0","I selected Station for a graduation dinner with 8 people, because it had delicious looking meat options, but also had a reputation for providing strong vegetarian/vegan options. The drinks were inventive and tasty, the server did an excellent job, and the entire meal from appetizer, through main course and dessert was fabulous -- everyone raved about their meals. The James Barkhurst (Dos maderas 5+3, Salignac cognac, Barolo Vermouth, Butterscoth dolin blanc vermouth, coffee porter), and a drink called the Penicillin stand out from the several that I sampled. The Roasted Carrot appetizer was truly amazing, a hearty blend of flavors and textures, and the best of the first courses tried. They also had a seasonal chilled cucumber soup (smoked trout roe, charred cucumber skins, pressure cooked ancho and a yogurt panna cotta). Interestingly the baby romaine salad with its buttermilk dressing reminded one of the guys of a great burger, without having any meat in it. Two people had the station burger, served with onion rings and ideal crispy, seasoned french fries bearing bits of real potato skin. They were great dipped in the asiago fondue that came with the burger. Two people had the vegetarian carrot bolognese, which they enjoyed. One had the spare rib appetizer for his meal, which ended up being a huge portion with four large ribs. Both the hanger steak and the scallops on the prix fixe menu were excellent.  The hanger steak was perfectly cooked and delicious, with its cauliflower, roasted mushroom, shallot and roasted garlic custard. But the scallops were unbelievably good, served over rhubarb jus with pickled ramp relish, white asparagus and green garlic fritter. Even though there were only three scallops, the entire dish was deeply satisfying, particularly the asparagus in the sweet-tart sauce and I thought the amounts of each element were perfectly satisfying. I appreciated that they did not just pay lip service to offering tiny bits of (tasty) vegetables, as often happens in nice restaurants, but gave enough for a balanced meal that stimulated the palate.  The lavendar pound cake with coconut pudding and candied pineapple was delicious and everyone happily helped the person that ordered it finish hers (it was a pretty large dessert). But the star of the desserts was the caramel caramel corn panna cotta, a rich satisfying custard topped with the most amazing caramel with caramel corn on top. My prix fixe meal (roasted carrots, scallops, panna cotta) was the best meal that I have had in a very long time, and at $45 was a real bargain."
"4.0","Very good service. Very good prices. Food was very good value. Nice after work location with friendly staff and non-sketch patrons. Will go there again. Tons of craft beer choices and awesome happy hour rituals."
"5.0","Hands down the best 'hot cakes' I've ever had. Hot cakes are a cross between crepes and pancakes and they are delicious! Fairly long wait here on a Sunday morning so come prepared to stand around for awhile. I also tried their famous potatoes (I forget the name but they have cream cheese in them) and they were amazing as well. Great place and I will be back!"
"3.0","The restaurant is pretty clean and the employees are friendly. Overall, the service was mediocre because I got a pager for my food because I was dining in, yet it never buzzed. After 15-20 minutes, I checked the counter and my food was there... I felt like they should've paged me another time if they saw that I didn't come to pick up my food. The food was average- the mac&cheese was very rich and the BBQ chicken flatbread was very drippy (sauce kept on dropping out). Overall, a decent meal, but in my eyes it's overpriced for the amount of food you get."
"5.0","There is no filafel on this earth better than Omar's.   This salad saves my life every time I eat it.  Pair it w his special lemon ginger kombucha and you may gain an extra life.   #B52"
"2.0","I've been to the original location in Harmony and never had a bad experience. Hopefully this place will end up giving the same service. Unfortunately the rosemary fries came out like warm and very soggy and the fried chicken had a nice taste to it but had way too much breading and always fell off the chicken. Also... they don't put any pricing on their cocktail list. So I have no clue if I'm paying 6.00 or 15.00 for my drinks."
"5.0","We went for restaurant week, and boy was I not disappointed. Not pictured: first course of lobster bisque. There were whole chunks of lobster and the taste was amazing. The bread they served is paired very well with it, too.Pictured: second course, which was pan seared salmon with corn polenta. I really like polenta and the side of it they served was delicious. The salmon was cooked perfectly, very tender, and tasted great! The third course dessert, which was a flourless chocolate cake. It wasn't a huge serving, which was perfect for lunch as it was just nice to have a little something sweet afterwards. It was very moist and dense. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive, too. The wait for our food was a little long, but that's completely expected during restaurant week. Overall a great experience."
"1.0","Arrived around 2:45 PM in the place was empty. I ordered a three-piece, the meat was dry and was not hot. The best thing about the meal was the cornbread which was hot. The restrooms are disgusting. I will not be back"
"2.0","I've heard so many good things about Tram's but I wasn't very impressed. Maybe I just didn't order the right dish. I ordered the beef vermicelli bowl, one egg roll, one spring roll. The beef in the dish was tough and poor quality cuts off meat (lots of cartilage) and too many noodles not enough greens. I love little ma and pa shops so I'll have to give him another try, maybe something vegetarian."
"5.0","Let me just say this.  I ate so much I had to be rolled out. Yelp is making me write more. It was great. Clean and the team was great. Didn't try any deserts but got the combo app."
"3.0","Was headed somewhere else but saw this place so decided to give it a try. Friendly bartenders. Small but had a long bar along one wall and a row of tables against other wall. 6 Tv's behind bar. After reading some of the food reviews decided to just drink a beer and head to my original destination."
"3.0","We had the MVP burger and the Hall of Fame Burger. Both were great and properly cooked. The french fries were hot, and crispy.  One of the burgers were supposed to have coleslaw on it, but it came with lettuce instead. The fries had a little bit too much salt.Our server seemed to be in zombie mode (Sam, I think).  We never got napkins or flatware; When we asked for napkins, we got paper cocktail napkins, not the cloth type at the other tables.  When we pointed out that we never received flatware, so that she wouldn't think we stole it, she blamed it on someone else. We had to repeatedly ask for refills on water and soda. Her heart is definitely not in the game.The bathroom (women's) were messy, the floors were very sticky, and there were wadded used towels on the sink top.  We were in the house around 2:30 PM on a Saturday afternoon."
"4.0","Love this place! All the food is delicious and lots of options, I always have a hard time deciding what I want to order, whether its the delicious pancakes or the croissant french toast (my mouth is watering just thinking about it!) The only thing I'm not a big fan of is the corned beef hash - super salty! But other than that, great portions, great taste, great atmosphere. It's cash only but there are multiple ATMs close-by so no excuse to not try this place if you haven't already!"
"5.0","Love this place! The food is so good! Coconut Shrimp Salad and the ahi tuna app! Boom! Amazing! The bar service is quick and the drinks are great! I'm waiting until my stomach is completely empty before I tackle the unlimited crab legs! I'm coming for all those legs! Nom Nom"
"4.0","My fiancé and I were bar hopping on Butler and before heading home stopped to get a pizza! It was totally custom made and they make it right in front of you (similar to a Blaze Pizza)! The workers were very patient especially since I like a lot on my pizza! The price was super affordable and the brownies were also good! Highly recommend if your looking for a quick pizza place! I will certainly be back!  They also have a punch card to earn a free pizza!"
"5.0","Great tasting. Relatively cheap. Large quantity. Good atmosphere. Kind employees. The General Manager was exceedingly patient and kind with me when I was ignorant of the ordering process the first time I went. One of my new favorite pizza places in the Burgh."
"5.0","Great little place in the north side.  Great apps, great dinners and amazing desserts.  It's an old school bar with a low key vibe.  The food absolutely great.  The dessert is amazing!"
"2.0","My husband and I ate here a couple years ago and LOVED it. We couldn't wait to have a reason to come back to Pitts and eat here again. 12/8/18 Came in town for a concert. We made reservations for our dinner well in advance of our trip and arrived 10 mins early. We were told upon arrival that they were running about 15 minutes behind on reservations because the concert that night and the place was packed. We didn't mind having to wait 15 mins for our table, try and be easy going. however 6:30 comes around and we still are waiting for a table. I overhear my husbands name quietly being said at the host stand. I said to the hubs I think we're next. But the host picked up the ticket and heads to the bar to look for the guests. He never did ask if we were the names on the ticket. After seating whoever it was, I said oh I must have misheard them and it wasn't us. After waiting another 15 mins my husband finally goes and asked when we will be sat. He gives our name again at which time the hostess has a look of quick panic and says you're next. My husband said by the look on her face she assumed we were already sat. So someone claiming to be us got tired of waiting and took our table. So FINALLY we get sat at 7 and ordered immediately. We have less then an hour to order, eat, and get to the venue. Which we were going to walk to. Again, we were looking so forward to this delicious meal. We were told by the host stand that they were getting food out of the kitchen quickly because most were going to the concert. Okay we still have 45 mins to enjoy dinner. Our food didn't come  to our table till 7:40 we immediately asked for the bill and paid it while eating as fast as we could and had to call for a car to drive us as we had no time to walk. My husbands steak was over cooked and if we weren't in such a rush we would have sent it back. My meal I will say, was delicious but I didn't get to enjoy it. Would have chose something small from the menu if we knew the kitchen was going to take longer then we were told. We spent 2 hrs here, to spend less then 10 minutes 'enjoying' our meal. And got to spend over $200 for the joy of it. And then had to pay for a car. Loved this place the first time we came. Probably would have loved it again if all went the way we were told it would. Mostly disappointed with the lack of communication with us from the staff, the morons who took our table, and what we paid to shove food down as fast as possible."
"4.0","I'm a big fan of the Ruth's Chris brand.  It's consistently good no matter where you are, and you can count on the big, fat delish steak and some humungo sides!We popped in here w/out a ressie just after Christmas to visit w/some family we hadn't seen in awhile.  They were able to seat us at a table in the bar, which was great since we were drinking some nice wine and getting a little boistrous...:)  All the food was great - everyone had steaks and we shared some sides.  Except my poor dairy-free partner.  I'm sorry to say it, but do not come here if you have a food allergy.  There's just nothing they can do to accomodate.  He had the fish, which came out dry and tasteless (apparently they don't have olive oil - only butter??!!) and was quite frankly the price of a steak, and none of the sides were really exciting for him - I think we had the steamed broccoli.  bla.  Look, I'm a fan.  But only go and spend this sort of money if you can really get the true steak-cooked-in-butter and everything-has-butter-and-cheese experience."
"4.0","The first thing I will say about this place: Excellent and polite service. The second thing is that the food is always hot and tasty. However, I look at this place as more of a fast food restaurant. Instead of fast food prices, they tend to charge a good bit more than the average fast food. Don't get me wrong, it's totally worth every penny, but that would be literally my only complaint. Everything else is spot on."
"2.0","Eh. Food served on paper plates. Long wait time for initial service and drink refills. Just not what I had in mind. I won't be going back."
"5.0","O.M.G. I currently live in Cleveland and I have my favorite breakfast/brunch go to place here (called Coventry Inn). But after going to Pamela's, now I'm depressed that Cleveland doesn't have a brunch place as good as Pamela's! I am craving this spot!Pamela's is your usual diner spot... place looks a bit homey, a bit dirty, and a bit...local. But that's when you know it's good right? It's got some real homemade cooking into it. If you don't want to listen to my suggestions on what to order, just (i beg you) make sure you order the CORN BEEF HASH. Here's my reviews below now:Corn Beef Hash (5+): I don't know what they add in there, but that sh*t is delicious and addictive. I took one bite, and it was like my palette was ready for 5 more bowls of it. The corned beef in the hash is so good. They season the corned beef so well that it gives the whole dish this heavenly taste.Chocolate Chip Banana Hotcakes (5): I think Pamela's called crepes hotcakes. This was just chocolate chip banana crepes. So naturally, it was delicious. The hotcakes was made really well, a bit crispy on the ends. and the melting chocolate with banana was just yummmmmmy.Go to Pittsburgh, and you better stop at Pamela's. There might be a wait, but trust me, it's worth it. And it's cheap!"
"4.0","Went for lunch - I think its all that they serve. Nothing more to say than - good food - decent price - and fast... Lunch with a drink was $8 and the portion was big.  Would compare the food to a Panda express with a little more of an authentic touch."
"3.0","Although the food was good, when we eventually got it... the service at the bar is subpar. Even with 7 bartenders (or so I counted) it wasn't enough for an extremely busy Saturday! I overheard someone say 'you could stay extremely sober in this place' which I completely agree. We came in during the penn state game, and understood the hype for this game... however it still took 15 min to even get a bartenders attention and that was eith the help of the kind folks sitting at the bar. In the matter of 4 hours we were there we o oh were able to order two drinks and food, and the food seemed to be an extreme inconvenience to the bartender. The appetizer came out after the main food order.... this seems like a great environment and fun fellow Pittsburgh fans, but the service just very below average."
"5.0","Umami is one of the five basic tastes, which some describe as meaty or brothy. YUM!First - I almost walked right by this place! The restaurant is on the third floor and the bathrooms are on the second floor.  Second- The private room looks so fancy, like it would be perfect for a birthday party, with traditional low seating and curtain for extra swankiness.Third- The bar is beautiful and long, with an overwhelming selection of drinks. Fourth- If you are there to eat, sit in front of the kitchen. It looks like the opening scene in Spirited Away when Chihiro's parents eat the food made for the spirits and get turned into pigs. I ordered a bowl of ramen, but  it was so big, I had no hope of finishing it. Also, order the chicken skin on the stick. It is so fatty and yummy, perfectly crispy. Finally, umami doesn't just describe the food- the cooks certainly fit that description too *wink*"
"5.0","Awesome. This restaurant is just awesome. Awesome food, awesome service, everything! I love coming here before seeing a show and for special occasions! I look forward to the vast wine selections and great steak!"
"3.0","MY first attempt at The Yard was for brunch a few weeks ago. We quickly glanced over their menu and sadly didn't find anything interesting so we decided to leave.We tried again a few weeks later. It was happy hour so we took advantage of it by getting all apps.... fried pretzels, mac & cheese balls, wings & fries.Loved the fries (& their ranch!) everything was great. I found the mac balls a little too salty but ive cut back a lot on sodium so im senstive to its taste now."
"5.0","Wow, you guys. Wow. Does anyone remember the days of Pizza Sola and how huge their slices were but also how sort of lacking in awesomeness of flavor they were? And also the creepiness factor of them always having pizza sitting out for who knows how long and they'd just warm it up in the oven for you? Well, this place has none of that nastiness! It's right in the swing of things on the Southside and was surprisingly chill for being 9ish on a Saturday night. My friend raved about this place for the past week, but I was skeptical due to other slice based places in the area that were big in quantity but lacking in quality. The slices, as you can see in my photos, are in fact huge. Two plates worth huge. The best part? THE FLAVOR! THE FREAKING THIN BUT CHEWY IN A GOOD WAY CRUST! THE FACT THAT EVERY GINORMOUS PIE IS MADE TO OTHER AND IT DOESN'T SIT UNDER A HOT LAMP WAITING TO BE SNEEZED ON. My slice was still bubbling and steaming when it came out of the oven. Do you think I waited for it to come down to acceptable temperatures before tasting it? Pffffft, you must not be familiar with my posts then. This pizza was delish in every possible way, and is appropriately priced at $4 for plain and $5 for a one topping slice seeing as to how you're easily getting three normal slices in one. It also happened to be the Southside art crawl, so there were a few bands playing and free beer offered. I had Rivertowne Grateful White and it was great! The not so great was the first band that played...the music was entirely too loud for the small space of the restaurant, and you had to yell at the person next to you to hear them at a whisper like level. Seriously dudes, next time you let a band play there tell them to turn the flipping amp down. The second band was lovely and had a smoother chill wave jazz vibe which I liked, mainly because of the 100% acceptable noise level they were giving off. I'll be back to see if this night was just an exceptional fluke or if this is really one of the best slices I've had."
"3.0","Overall Impression:A BYO-salad emporium with reasonable pricing that includes classic E'nP menu items like the Superburger and delicious Potato Soup--smiley cookies included!The Food:If you're looking for healthy(ish) place filled with customization, this is amazing even for the pickiest salad eaters. The BYO-salad bar is really what this place is all about. Not only are the toppings plentiful and fresh, but they REALLY pack them in there to give you a bountiful meal that will not leave you hungry. I've also had their soups (classic E'nP style) and a couple of their burgers over the last couple years, and I was always satisfied with how they tasted. My go-to burger (pictured below) is the Two Alarm Turkey Burger with added Avocado for some extra creamy-ness. It may look a little messy, but the messiest burgers area always the best. The tomato soup is thick and sweet--not going to lie, tasted like Campbell's from a can (processed), it could probably do with some more herbs/TLC. When I have indulged in their fries, they've been extremely greasy, and their burgers are more greasy than others I've eaten, but it's not to the point where it makes the food unappetizing. The Restaurant:This location has a great takeout setup (I'd high recommend if you hate waiting) and in-restaurant salad assembly line. Flipping the usual 'eat, then pay' model on it's head, the customer begins their salad journey at the register and pays for either an $8 unlimited topping (they mean it) salad or a menu item. You're then guided to the salad assembly line, setup Subway style, where you pick all the toppings under the sun, and you get your own drink (no servers). You sit with a number at your table and they bring your meal to you. The only reason this place gets 3 instead of 4 stars from me is their cleanliness. Every time I walk in here, there's food all over the floor, the trash is overflowing, and empty tables are dirty. I also have a huge issue with their salad-makers not wearing any head coverings and just pulling their hair back. I wish they'd wear hats or hairnets--there's no way 5-10 women go through an entire day without hair flying around. The takeout shelf is very hands-off. You literally walk right in and pick up your bag (check it!) and leave without speaking to anyone and avoiding the salad assembly line, it definitely runs smooth.TL;DRBYO customized salad for a reasonable price or try a classic burger. You can get your EnP comfort fix while still trying to be healthy---ish! Just do yourself a favor and order online to pickup."
"4.0","Went for a late lunch on New Years Eve. Expected a crowd, but the restaurant had a very light crowd.  Waiter was very attentive, food was absolutely outstanding. Soup, fries, burger, tenderloins and chicken were all done superbly, some creme brûlée for dessert was a great finish. Only issue was a phantom charge on our bill for somebody else's drink."
"1.0","Once again talk is cheap. Ordered a pizza at 8:30 was told 40min to deliver didn't get till 9:55. Oh I live 3 min walking distance. My fault for being lazy I guess.  On top of that pizza was burn on edge and like warm so dough has that soft not done taste. Total let down. Hate to say it but Dominos woulda been better. Haha that not true dominos sucks too. Cereal for dinner... Perfect."
"5.0","My husband and I came before a concert and loved everything! The happy hour specials are nice. The gyoza was some of the best I've ever had. It's a great atmosphere with amazing cocktails to boot. Will definitely come again when I'm in the area!"
"3.0","I used to ignore the ambience , the service, run down look. But now even the food is not good anymore . With more options coming up in the area I doubt will go there any time soon. Sorry guys have to say it like it is now."
"3.0","I popped in here with a friend of mine before going to a pens game.The menu is extensive both in food and in cocktails and in beer selection. Wowie zowie that beer selection is legit. The cocktail menu has a whole page dedicated to mules!!! Oh how i love a good mule. I recommend the kentucky mule, you can't go wrong with whisky and ginger beer. Not ever. I ordered the nashville hot chicken sandwich, my friend ordered a veggie burger. Time to look around. The decor is nice, the space is very open and visually appealing. the bar is bigger than the beer selection. There are TVs everywhere. The staff seemed friendly. Our waiter was nice and attentive for the most part. I had made a reservation ahead of time, and asked if we could sit outside but it got cold and windy and I changed my mind which seemed like not a big deal to them. Seated inside. Near the door. It's a very large space though and I can see them getting overwhelmingly busy during a sports ball game. We did our best to drink our drinks quickly, we were nearly done when we ordered another round, the waiter tried to take them away, we said no way buddy we're not finished just yet. The food came. It looked great and for the most part it tasted as great as it looked. I would not in any stretch of any imagination call this a nashville hot chicken wrap, it was good, just not nashville hot chicken good. Our bill came. And  holy hell, I forgot how expensive things can get. If I had to choose between city works and some other run of the mill sports bar with high price points... I'd probably just go get mexican food across the way. Maybe it's expensive because they have so much space and so many tv's. Maybe it's the location. Who knows. I just don't think for what we spent on our meal and 2 drinks it would be worth a second visit. If you're looking for a bit of a higher end place to watch the game any game really, this might be for you. As far as it goes for me and mine... it's a soft pass."
"5.0","Being Thai I can tell you this place is really good! Just like moms cooking! Make sure you get a Thai tea with your meal!"
"5.0","We are not vegan but have loved everything we have tried! The fresh prince rolls and curry are great! Try a cupcake or Eddie for dessert!"
"2.0","Nashville hot chicken wrap tasted like chili powder was just dumped on it - no actual flavor, just chili powder.  Bloody Mary was underwhelming (especially for $15) but lots of beers on tap to choose from.  Pluses: Atmosphere is nice for game day (lots of TVs) and the server was nice."
"2.0","Panera is a go to stop for me when I use my Panera rewards and have a craving for a pick 2. You have parking available around the location but can easily walk from one of the nearby hotels or hospital. The location is large and have a good amount of sitting room.The customer service was good the food was below average at best. I went for the Turkey BLT & Chicken Apple salad pick 2. The food came after 3-4 minutes. It was obvious after the first bite the food wasn't fresh. The chicken was partially frozen along with the lettuce on both my sandwich and salad. My side of an apple was delicious though!"
"4.0","Beautiful decor and great food. Although they have various options, I believe their strength is in their Ramen. The service was excellent and very attentive.The Ramen was spicy and delicious. All the ingredients were of the highest quality. While I was expecting Korean cuisine, the name Yuzu is meant to suggest Korea, Japan and China, the 3 countries that feature this fruit in their recipes."
"5.0","Delanie's was super quaint coffee shop. Coffee was tasty and my boyfriend got the dirty chai and it was delicious! Their food is also reeeaaallly good. The service was great and quick. Highly recommend Devil Wears Gouda."
"3.0","I came here about a year ago with some friends for dinner, when one of my friends wanted Italian food, and we wanted to try a place in Bloomfield.  I ordered the create-your-own pasta with mafalda pasta, gorgonzola basil cream sauce, and chicken.  The sauce was actually quite tasty, although a bit on the strong side, and overpowered the chicken quite a bit.  It was definitely unique, however!  The bread that was served with the pasta was thick and soft, but wasn't particularly unique.  Service was fine, and the atmosphere was nice.  Overall, not a bad option for Italian food in Bloomfield, and I'd go back if a dining companion wanted to try it, but I wouldn't go out of my way to return since there's better Italian to be had elsewhere in PGH.  3.5 stars."
"4.0","I use this Bruegger's each time I'm feeding a large group. They make it really easy to order a large quantity of bagels, large containers of coffee, and tubs of cream cheese. I highly recommend using them for this especially because they open early."
"4.0","Hi.  The four star rating is for the staff and the old time ambiance. We went in last week for my birthday meal and we totally enjoyed ourselves. The food came out hot and quickly. It isn't gourmet eating but that isn't important as we went to experience the oldest bar in Pittsburgh -- that's  what makes the Original Oyster House a memorable reason to go to."
"3.0","It was our first order from Beta Bite. I ordered a chicken pannini and my husband ordered a 10' pepperoni pizza. The delivery was somehow fast and the quality was average. based on the reviews, I expected fries with my sandwich, but no fries! Also, my husband's pizza was small and oily. Surprisingly, there was also a chicken bone in my sandwich! In overall, average quality and expensive with respect to the small portions."
"2.0","This place is nostalgic, but not great. Reheated pizza, off-brand chips,  things heated on a small rolling grill, a drink machine that never has enough carbonation and I've felt off every time I've eaten there. They are nostalgic for mw and they were to first to open up their arms to the furries at Anthrocon, but that's only worth 2 stars."
"5.0","Yelp was pushing me to order through the app, so after a quick search I came across Beta Bites, the food looked delicious and they offer options I can't find commonly (Okra!)The delivery wait was as expected from a place in the busy end of town (and big props for downtown delivery!), and the food was top notch. The Okra was delicious, the lamb panini was flavorful, and even the Mac & cheese tasted great. Def. on my go to list in the future."
"5.0","Arnold's has been such a wonderful addition to E. Ohio street! They have an awesome selection of teas but I mostly come for the delicious sandwiches! The owner, Verna, is so sweet and you can tell she truly loves the neighborhood and wants to provide excellent service. The space has a really cool vibe and I've seen lots of events here. I would highly recommend the Happy Turkey club, the Pear Arugula Salad, or the breakfast sandwich!! They are all seriously delicious. This is an awesome community spot on the north side and I am so happy to have it in the neighborhood!"
"5.0","Thank goodness for a vegetarian vegan spot with great food and a comfortable Nuevo Diner ambiance. Great coffee and espresso too. Small with limited seating makes it an instant classic, intimate neighborhood go to.  Great service and everything else. I can't write much but stop reading and get yo B52. No I do not own the place it's just damn good. Pittsburgh needs a lot more quality vegetarian spots like this."
"5.0","Excellent slices of thin crust pie with tasty options like garlic and mushroom or chicken, ranch and cheese. Huge portions of pie and great place to stop in and have some good pizza right out of the oven. Great ambiance too."

"4.0","I went here on Black Friday for the first time, when nothing else was open! OMG - so good! I got a roasted chicken sandwich and guess what - real chicken breast! And the fries...I'm not even a fry person, especially natural fries, but they are bomb.com!! And reasonably priced for the bldg...9 bucks for the great sandwich, enough fries for 3, and a cold rootbeer...can't beat that!! The most important thing I think is the people. They are so genuine! My 2nd visit and multiple people are calling me by name...c'mon now, where they do that at? LOL"

"4.0","Tried four different noodle ramen dishes.They were delicious.  Maybe the one with kimchi was the best.Overall, the impression is that for the price, the noodles quantity was on the low side (but were very good, freshly made...)"
"4.0","Smallman Galley continues to change it's chefs and now there are two new concepts in the Galley. Sultry opened on June 7th in the spot formerly occupied by Banhmilicious. I got to chat with the couple known as Chef Brian F and Chef Melissa B from various parts of the country.Their concept is Eastern European cuisine.  Chef Brian went over the menu with me. He explained that they are locally sourced. All their meat comes from Goodness grove farm located in Butler, PA. They have on their menu in addition to their regular offerings, gluten free, vegetarian, and certain items can be made vegan upon request. He showed me a chicken pate which is on their 'teaser' list from the farm which could serve as a meal in itself.Upon their recommendation I ordered the chicken schnitzel with pickled garden toppings. The ordering is the usual. Pay and then take a number and they will find your table to serve you. It took a bit of time but I finally got my lunch. It was very good but in some places a little difficult to cut. Still the pickled toppings made it flavorful and the pan jus made it taste better.I asked about their dessert menu. So far all they offer is Kompot which is a homemade juice or a ladylock cup. I went with the latter. Melissa brought it out to me herself. She explained that it is a puff pastry with vanilla Bavarian cream, a berry sauce, and a strawberry crackling on top. Although it appeared huge I was glad that it was a light dessert and not overfilling.  Needless to say it was very good. Sultry is a welcome addition to Smallman Galley. I learned that their tenure will be a year. Parking in the Strip District continues to remain problematic but I usually have no trouble parking in the Cork Factory garage which is a few blocks down. New concept and a great meal to boot!"
"5.0","The best ramen in the burgh! I don't know how others are disagreeing with that. I love this place so much that I walked all the way there last Sunday just to find out it was closed. (So keep that in mind) But I was able to go back a few days later and it was just as delicious as I remembered!! I recommend the rayu cucumber appetizer and all of the bao buns I've had were great!"
"5.0","Wow! Fully delicious, highly affordable and kick-ass ambiance! The tunes rule as well! Don't think twice! Go, Eat, enjoy!"
"4.0","This is very nice café.The coffee is fantastic. It's strong & has a lot of good flavorThe café crepe was good. It could have a little more flavor in it. But I would give it four out of five.The bacon chicken sandwich was very good with the exception of the chicken being kind of dry. I would give the sandwiches three out of five and probably choose something different next time I go.Besides all of that came with the sandwich in the crate we're good they had balsamic vinegar rat on them.The price was a little expensive for what we got. I was also little disappointed to find out that they did not have tapwater and we got charged for half size bottles of water.Overall the experience was pretty good the staff was friendly and attentive environment was nice. We will definitely be back."
"3.0","Cheap Indian lunch buffet. Food was alright although I do wish that they had more options for the diner to try."
"5.0","I live a block away and no longer have any reason to leave my neighborhood because this place is the bomb.com - fantastic food, awesome wait staff, cocktails that will blow your pants off. The desserts will take off your top ;-)"
"2.0","I will preface this review by saying that I have only had the buffet here, but I have had it several times.  If you are accustomed to good Indian food, I would definitely not go out of my way to eat here.  This place survives off the hospital/academic crowd in Oakland - it is directly across the street from UPMC Presbyterian Hospital.  Their price for the buffet is pretty reasonable, but I have seen less than fresh items on their salad bar, especially the peppers.  Most of the offerings on their buffet table are standard fare, just slightly below average in taste and quality though."
"3.0","My girlfriend suggested we go here for lunch now that the downtown location of Storms has closed. She took me up a flight of stairs. We were greeted warmly and sat down at a table overlooking a window.They have daily specials which are posted on one of those triangle boards outside the restaurant. I decided to go with the chicken breast sandwich with coleslaw. She went with a spinach salad topped with salmon. Her salad was supposed to come with a bacon dressing.We got our food in a descent amount of time. My chicken breast was very thick but was on a regular bun. It was good but very messy. The coleslaw was average. My girlfriend told me that she loved her spinach salad however, it seemed as though the dressing she got was more like a vinaigrette than a bacon dressing. She inquired about it and was given another. She later told me that it still tasted like a vinaigrette. Prices here seem to be much more reasonable and you can get away with a sandwich and side for under $10.00 if you aren't ordering drinks. There is a bar area which wasn't open during our visit.The place is clean and the staff very friendly. They have other items on the menu such as paninis and I understand their specialty is hamburgers. Will have to try one next visit here.I gather that we must have eaten in their banquet hall. I did not get the opportunity to see the restaurant and bar below.It makes for a descent lunch if you work near or in the area and are under time constraints because of work."
"3.0","So I'm giving Mezzo Three stars. Which they are receiving for the attentive wait staff, wine, and ambiance. I personally was not impressed with the food at Mezzo. I ordered a margarita pizza which was placed on top of an old tomato sauce can, which I thought was clever; however, the two person table I was seated at was a bit small for this set up. The pizza itself looked good, but came out tepid. The basil leaves were rather large and unfortunately there were a lot of them on the pizza, so they overpowered the thin, insipid sauce. I ended up having a few slices left over, but I let my date take those home. I'm a huge fan of pizza, so if that isn't good then I'm probably going to sulk the rest of the evening. Overall, the whole building is zero for two with me. I hope when I try the first floor meatball place I'm impressed or I will not be coming back to dine at any of the three levels."
"5.0","Excellent vegan food, lots of vegan dessert options! Can't wait to go back and try some more, as a non vegan I was very satisfied when dinner was over and didn't  feel like I was missing anything from my meal. A+"
"4.0","Having recently moved from Hawaii, where there are tons of great asian restaurants, I am on the hunt for good Japanese food.  Kiku is about as good as I've found in the area, and it is quite good.  I felt it was a bit pricey, but I'm willing to spend some $$$ if the food is good, and the food is good here.  I've had the Chirashi, several types of rolls, and the tonkatsu.  So far, everything is good.  The sushi was fresh, the tonkatsu battered light and crispy.  Our server, Masako, gave good recommendations, and the sushi chef was entertaining to talk to as well."
"4.0","We walked in and seated ourselves. Looked like they had a walk-up counter from which you could order from the outside. Unfortunately the back patio was closed at the time so we settled for a high top table. The interior was decorated with large eclectic art pieces and empty picture frames.My friend and I ordered two coffees and two crepe entrees for under $25. We split one savory and one sweet, the Polish hill and the Nutella banana. Food came out with minimal wait. Presentation was great and the crepes were absolutely delicious! Very fulfilling. Good portions and an even better price."
"5.0","THE BONE! A great dive/diner vibe, always good live music, great beer, great people. Hambone's is a great place to go and hang out with friends for a no frills, quality good time! The food is pretty good, too!"
"2.0","Wise Guys is your typical off beat pizza shop. There are no frills, there are no items I would particularly recommend. However, if you'd like cheap pizza and the typical sides that come along with that then this is your spot. No room to sit and eat so pick it up and get out of there. I am not saying it's bad by any means, it just isn't anything special."
"5.0","Ordered the provolone hoagie and bacon cheese fries. They were piping hot when they came and were delicious. Fazio's has some awesome Italian dressing for their subs. I ordered my food for delivery and it was there in 30 minutes as most places can take over an hour sometimes. I have lived in this area for 3 years and regret not trying Fazio's sooner! I will definitely be a repeat customer."
"4.0","After a few hours of hard work and productivity at Espresso A Mano, we walked a couple blocks to grab a bite to eat. It was pretty slow and empty at the time around 1pm in the afternoon on a Tuesday. I have to say that my favorite thing about this place was 'The Toilet Paper' on the bathroom stalls. It's a one-page newsletter of happenings and facts pertaining to the restaurant. So while you're doing your business, you can read. I ordered the burger slide with chili cheese fries and my friend the Shadyside burger with cheese fries. We both enjoyed our meals. My chili cheese fries kind of overtook my plate. The cheese and chili are rather thin and therefore flood the plate. Nonetheless, very good and flavorful along with the burger. I built my own little burger and very much enjoyed it. I can't say that I wouldn't or won't come back, but I won't be in a hurry."
"3.0","Salsa bar is fun. Specials aren't too interesting. Ultimately the food is overpriced and the restaurant area upkeep seems to overwhelm the staff."
"5.0","Absolutely fantastic pizza. Little pricey but it is very good. Great ingredients and crunchy crust provided a great combination"
"2.0","Possibly a 'trifecta of bad' with surly waitstaff, crappy food (coconut shrimp burnt, romaine lettuce core left in the salad, pizza charred, $7 for a bottle of beer) and smoking being permitted on outside deck.  The view is nice, but you can get the view for free by walking on the trail."
"1.0","Food is very good, but if you really like bad service delivered with a bad attitude, then Mezzo is for you."
"1.0","These people need to get there stuff together dropping drinks out the window messing up orders and very long wait time. Prep takes you a long way. I wanted supreme tacos that's all I wanted y'all got me man y'all got me for my bread"
"2.0","Been coming here for years. Food is always good. Thats where the good ends. Often out of items. HORRIBLE service. Food always takes forever, regardless of how many people in the restaurant. Can't even avoid these in house issues with ordering pick-up because it still takes forever, and they almost always get your order wrong."
"4.0","Excellent sushi but also full menu of other wonderful items.  Loved the curry squid and the fried chicken.  Will be back!"
"1.0","Awful service that is constantly behind. They soften get customers orders wrong as well."
"4.0","Unique japanese bar food that is always made very well and beautifully!! A little more pricey than an average sushi place but thats because of the great japanese bar like ambiance and the unique preparation of sushi and other japanese dishes that are hard to find anywhere else in Pittsburgh!"
"5.0","A must for anyone who loves food.Favorite place in the city to eat.  Chicken and rice and everything nice. The spinach is next level. And i can almost guarantee you never had a hamburger this good before, then theres a chicken burger as well which is my favorite.    dont get me started on the Ramadan buffet if your not even Muslim its worth fasting to go to.   Their use of spices is top notch.  And the turkish delights are phenomenal like truly phenomenal. They also have a market next door with fresh meats and all that.   This place is the secret gem of the city."
"5.0","This place did not come up on searches for vegan food in Pittsburgh so I'm hoping this review helps. They dont have a ton of vegan choices but they have enough and the food is so good. Especially the salt and pepper todu!! If I lived in Pittsburgh I'd eat it every week. So good and James was an excellent server!"
"5.0","Stopped here for dinner with a friend one night. I was greeted upon arrival and given my choice of table, since the place wasn't super busy (I went on a week night). Our waiter was attentive and willing to answer any questions that we had. After reviewing the menu, I decided on the blackened swordfish. It came with a side of asparagus and mashed potatoes. *oh and the best part, is that the swordfish is topped with lump crab meat! The food didn't take long at all and before we knew it, dinner was served! I was pleasantly surprised at the portion of food. I was able to take half of the swordfish and mashed potatoes home for my lunch the next day. Everything was seasoned perfectly and cooked just right. This wasn't my first visit to Luke Wholey's but it was my first time trying the swordfish. I will definitely get that time and time again!"
"4.0","First off, this is much more then a just a Sub place.  SCSubs has fresh tasty Bowls and Salads.  There is a printed menu you can read since the chalkboard is a little hard to read.  On the back of the menu there is a long list of the local vendors they use to get the fresh ingredients.  So what did we have.  I had a Focus Bowl that had a variety of items including zucchini, carrots, riced cauliflower, cucumber, radish, avocado and a lime and olive oil and a few ingredients that I cannot remember.  Very tasty and some of the items including the riced cauliflower were roasted.  A really tasty and filling meal.  You can had a protein if you wish, but I just wanted the fresh veggies.  My dining partner had one of the salads and said it was really good.  They said they have been open about two weeks.  It is located in the Smallman Galley.Will have to stop back and try a Sub."
"3.0","Ok, I get it. Brunch is amazing. Sunday brunch is more amazing after a late night on Saturday. And I wholeheartedly agree that the food here is good- (how can you mess up brunch?). However, this branch on Shadyside is a nightmare to go to on the weekends. It takes FOREVER to get a table here every time. There are mounds of people that line up on Walnut Street to get a table. After spending the time outside, any food they offer you will sound amazing because your stomach is growling so loudly. Objectively, the food here is good and the dinner decor has a lot of character. However, I stopped going here a long time ago when I discovered that Harris Grill brunch is much more hearty and the wait will at least be half an hour less."
"4.0","We got the steak burrito and falafel sub. Both were really good but the burrito is very small in comparison to the sub. The fries were also amazing. Delivery was also pretty fast, and it took around an hour to arrive. We will definitely be coming back!"
"3.0","Okay- Love China Town Inn but the last 3 times that I have gotten Shrimp Fried Rice it just wasn't up to par.  I was highly upset the last time... thinking it was a fluke... I hope they see this and step their game back up."
"5.0","This was so great.  We walked in and walked out within 5 minutes.  Got four tacos and nachos.  Everything was delicious and incredibly inexpensive.  Would definitely recommend."
"5.0","Awesome dinner! My husband and I were in Pittsburgh for our daughters Pitt orientation and headed to the South Side on a recommendation for dinner. We wandered around until we thought this place looked good. What a great find!  Homemade mozzarella ( recommended by Yelp!) was perfect and beet salad was delicious. Cavatelli  was good but not out of this world. My husband had the pork chop which was delicious. The service was friendly and attentive, and plates cleared and water filled.  I would absolutely dine here again when I come to Pittsburgh."
"2.0","I really wanted to like this place, but...16 taps: 1 sparkling ale, 1 dark ale, 1 sour, 3 IPAs, 1 cider, and....yep, 9 taps empty. Meh.And then the food: Pretentious descriptions that bordered on the unintelligible (how many Americans know what 'chicharrones' or 'raillettes' are?*), to which the plates themselves did not really live up. This place should spend more time producing beer and having their taps full, balance the 4 IPA/sour taps with some barrel aged beers or at least some more variety, and make the food more approachable.*I do, I am fluent in 4 languages, but c'mon, this is Lawrenceville."
"4.0","Very nice restaurant over all.  The staff was friendly and accomodating; the menu had a nice selection.While the restaurant is nice, I felt that the food was a bit over rated (not five star) and the restaurant way overcrowded.Even so, my wife and I hope to go back one day."
"4.0","La Gourmandine is a great bakery to have nearby if you love French pastry. They have a good selection of different pasties everything from the basic croissant to multilayered cakes. The downtown location also has sandwiches and coffee in addition to some seating. The macarons are pretty good , but not the best and they never offer that many flavors- they are more of just a tacked on offering. There other pastries - like the marquise cake! Are much better. My only issues with this store is that it is super crowded at all times, there is very little seating, and ordering is very hard because of the set up of the long narrow counter which you have to walk the whole way down to see everything which is impossible when it it crowded. Also, it's pretty darn pricy (a lot of pasties are $4, macarons $1.65, full cakes $27.50) and if you want a full cake or pie call ahead or go early, they often only have one of each per day."
"5.0","Great food regardless of it being Vegan or not.  Anyone should love the food here. The menu is creative and distinctive but not alienating to simple tastes or carnivores.   I would reccomend this restaurant to anyone looking for something new and delicious."
"4.0","The food was super delicious! Well prepared and presented well. It came out super fast. However, I was disappointed by my margarita. I ordered a house margarita and it was extremely weak, seemed to be all sour mix. The decor is fairly fun and hip with rod-iron lights and tables so I expected an updated and fresh drink menu with fun and stronger cocktails. I think a fresh drink menu would bode well, or at least make your drinks worth drinking!  Overall good experience though"
"5.0","I LOVE MARIO'S! I visit Pittsburgh at least once a year and I make sure to visit this spot every time! The staff are awesome and personable! Even when it's super busy, you can still get a drink in reasonable time! I like how there are levels that welcome smoking and other ones that do not. (I'm a non-smoker and appreciate this quality!) It gets rowdy there, but that's part of the South Side fun!"
"3.0","I have to agree with everyone here. The location is prime, the layout is perfect for watching sports and mingling with friends, and the drink selection is great. However, the service is slow and the food is not worth the price. City Works is a great spot to go for post-brunch drinks, but not so great for date night. If you go when it's busy, don't expect to leave quickly. If you go when it's quiet, still don't expect to leave quickly.I understand servers can get swamped and overwhelmed, but sitting with an empty drink for extended time isn't ideal when you're paying $12-15 for a cocktail. Appetizers are good bar snacks, but as far as full on meals, I recommend going elsewhere."
"4.0","I ordered once for takeout and once for delivery from Grub Hub. Food is consistently pretty good. The veggie rolls are huge and fantastic (best part of the meal, by far). I could eat a whole plate of them alone. General Tso's chicken is great. The Cantonese Style Tomato Chili Chicken was not at all what I thought it would be, but it wasn't bad. Delivery takes forever through Grub Hub, and the restaurant forgot one of our veggie rolls, which Grub Hub reimbursed. Those are my only complaints. We will probably order again."
"3.0","Will I go here on a weekend night out?  Probably not.  BUT, I will go during football season on a Sunday if I get there early and get a spot to sit in.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised when towards the end of the football season we decided to give Mario's a try for some Sunday football (since my husband's team not going to be on local TV).  We had a few great times!  Good service, good bar food, and no drunken Ed Hardy wearing punks starting anything (minus one time actually, but that reflects on these idiots and not Mario's).  I may not see the inside of Mario's until closer to September, but I will be back :)"
"4.0","Hungarian comfort foods as good as homemade by nagymama (granny). Chicken Paprikas is my favorite."
"5.0","My favorite new restaurant and one of the few reasons to hit up east Carson. The pressed filet is amazing. I find myself frequently craving it. There's never a long wait and the staff is great. I will continue to request this restaurant to friends."
"2.0","Ramen was Ok.  Ordered an alcoholic drink which came with the ramen.  My husband ordered an appetizer which never arrived, and we asked if they planned to bring it for dessert?  Others at different tables received them as they should've.  Bill came and was charged an extra dollar for ice!  It was explained that when drinks are ordered on the rocks, it comes as a larger pour.  Since my drink arrived with my ramen, it wasn't finished, I couldn't believe this."
"1.0","I know what you're thinking. Of course I'm going to give it a 1 star rating just because it's McDonald's. On the contrary, I actually enjoy McDonald's food. Big Macs are horribly underrated, in my (unpopular) opinion.With that being said, my rating is for this particular McDonald's location. It's a chaotic mess. The service is painfully slow, the employees are rude, and my orders have been messed up 95% of the time. I have waited 20 minutes for a coffee. A COFFEE! *facepalm*Needless to say I will NEVER be returning. I'll pay a little extra to keep me from pulling my hair out of my head."
"5.0","This was my first time eating here, although I pass it all the time going to class. I got the chicken tikka masala and didn't realize how large it was going to be. Good Indian food for a good price. The people working are very nice, always a plus! I'll definitely be coming back here again to try something else."
"5.0","Really good indian in Pittsburgh!  Everything my friend and I had was awesome! Portions were generous (perhaps too generous?)  - We'll be going back again and again."
"5.0","This place was unbelievably out of this world !! From the moment u pull up to the place! Non stop service! First let me start off our waiter was absolutely amazing! Ask for Horacio!! He's great!! I ordered the filet 10oz and it was cooked to pure perfection! With sides of Au gratin potatoes and spinach! Which were also out of this world !!! For starters we had the calamari! And there's not enough stars here to give that order! My counter part ordered the filet Oscar med well- which is topped with fresh crab meat ... Soft like butter and fresh !! Amazing experience here! The ambiance is wonderful! This is a high end steak house!!! Loved it!"
"5.0","Such a find. I'm just sad it's far from my home! Came for lunch with my friend that's been raving about the food. She lives nearby and loves it. I had the peanut butter and raspberry preserves on toast with a cinnamon rose latte. Shut the front door. I know it doesn't sound amazing but each element was perfect. The latte wasn't too sweet which happens more often than not. The peanut butter tasted homemade and the preserves were delightful, like fresh picked fruit. I can't wait to try the falafel salad. That was my second choice.  Someone happened to order it seated next to us . I got a peak and it looked wonderful, too. Cool atmosphere and service was fast and pleasant."
"4.0","I just have to give these guys a good word and somewhat of a mea culpa for stumbling in here (with my Uber driver, no less) after quite a few last weekend at about 2am.  The woman was nice enough to hear me out and make me exactly what I wanted- which included some pretty bizarre ingredient combinations.  Thanks a bunch....and it (of course) tasted great."
"4.0","Came in here for a beer before dinner. Bar area was jammed and hard to get a standing spot. I had one of the darker brews, which I really liked. Small selection but all seemed really good and interesting. Bar thinned out as we were there. Didn't stay for food but menu looked interesting."
"3.0","I was brought here by a friend and was pleasantly surprised by the set up. An old living and dining room set up like a restaurant was sort of cool. We came at the tail end of the weekend lunch buffet, but the options didn't taste like they'd been sitting around for 3 hours. As a former Indian Garden addict, I really liked the focus on more vegetarian friendly dishes on the buffet instead of the normal chicken tikka masala and such. I can't remember for the life of me what the names of anything I had was, but I can tell you that it was yummy and worth it. Get there early or later if you don't want to sit in a loud and cramped room. Will be back during dinner hours so I can order from the menu!"
"5.0","After receiving poor service at Jamba Juice a few doors down, I really wanted to try this place. I went in on a whim one afternoon and LOVED it. The atmosphere was so inviting and on theme. The employees were very friendly, service was quick, line was organized, and my smoothie was delicious. If I weren't a college student, I would so come here more often and try everything (lack of funds). I'll be back soon!"
"2.0","I was excited to have Nepali food and had heard good things about this place.  Unfortunately the place was dingy and the food was not carefully made.  In the biryani, there were pieces of random, oddly sized vegetables that I don't think belonged in the dish.  I don't think I'll be back anytime soon."
"1.0","I'm Vietnamese, worse viet food ever! Beware, I don't know how they are surviving here in Pittsburgh . One of our soups looked like it was curry and its suppose to be a clear soup. Please save yourself the trouble, I'm really surprised with the 4 stars."
"4.0","The food was very good and the fries were wonderful - crisp and seasoned. I rarely find very good fries - especially in a busy restaurant. The service was really good and very friendly. The happy hour drink specials are decent, but their 'domestic draft' special only includes the base horrible American beers - it doesn't include the American ciders or good American beers.Thankfully, our waitress told us that it excluded what we were ordering.I'll definitely return."
"5.0","I LOVE THIS PLACE! While I was a Fellow at Carnegie Mellon, I was introduced to this place and fell in love. OBAMA came here too! Cash only, and nearly anything you order off the menu is pure GOLD!.. well.. not literally gold because that'd be weird to eat.. but its REALLY good food!Seriously. Don't even look. Just close your eyes, point at something, and order it. It's guaranteed to be de-lic-ious. I ordered almost everything off the menu during my summer here. I MISS IT! :'("
"5.0","Having been to three other Indian restaurants in Oakland, I think I can say confidently that this food truck beats them all. Everything is made fresh, the portions are huge, and it's an amazing value for just $5! I recommend this place to everyone who visits Pitt. Never had a bad meal here, and I don't think I ever will."
"4.0","Attention upper Lawrencevillians with a penchant for the quaint, a new shopping opportunity with unexpectedly high quality options is all up in your block.  Remember how you used to ask the Shop N Save if they had any Gorgonzola or frizzante only to be shunned like the shameless foodie you deserve to be?  We'll now you got a market on 52nd street called the 52nd street market that has all your recycled paper products organic laundry detergent and fair trade chocolate coveted espresso beans right next door.  You don't even need a bike or the 54a to take you over hill to Whole Foods, no sweat!  They have very limited inventory right now, prices are reasonable.  Very local, meats are from Butcher on Butler, pretzels from Axels, and breads from Allegro Hearth."
"4.0","Frank's is a consistent and reliable neighborhood place. Their broasted chicken is fantastic! Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  We are usually grilled chicken eaters, but their broasted chicken is so yummy we made an exception and ordered it two weekends in a row. Also don't miss their breadsticks which are garlicky and Parmesan cheesy and just all around delicious."
"3.0","It's okay. Overpriced for the things they serve, although the chicken is decent. The way they seal the bubble tea is pretty neat! Perfect for when you're on the go and can spill it easily, like myself. My biggest gripe is that they charge extra for the tapioca bubbles. If the bubble tea is more expensive than other stores, that's fine. Make the wholesale price greater. Don't charge extra for the tapioca bubbles if it's in the NAME. Make it more expensive and extra toppings will be extra. There's nothing wrong with that."
"2.0","Had oyster po boy for $18 not so great. Terrible old fries, for $18 maybe edible fries?"
"5.0","Hello. I dined at this eat n park for dinner on January 28th, 2016. I ordered pancakes. They tasted nice. Thank you."
"5.0","Let me tell you how I even tried this place for a second time. My boyfriend and I were driving down the street discussing what to eat. He asked, 'if you could eat a burger where would you go?' And he listed a places we could go and we discovered that Burghers was the one place you could get a good burger, amazing fries, and a good milkshake. This trip we tried the Bloomfield and were we blown away. This is simply the best burger ever. It's full of flavor and fresh ingredients. I mean we wish there was a Garfield burger in the menu but until then we will say this is the best to us."
"1.0","Poor service!  I personally would recommend going anywhere but here. My group ended up leaving before we even ordered."
"4.0","Had a Thai peanut and chicken salad. Very good. The only thing I would change is I would add almonds. The dressing was delicious. It was fresh and the service was great. I love au bon pain and even though they're pricey I think it's worth it."
"1.0","I ordered a pizza at 12:30 am and it did not arrive until 2:00 am.  I was never contacted about a delay with my order.  I made an attempt to contact the establishment but I was sent straight to voicemail multiple times even though I called before their supposed closing hours.  The pizza was average and very poorly cut not pleasing to the eye whatsoever.  I do appreciate the fact the pizza arrived at all but I'm still upset."
"5.0","My husband and I finally tried Siempre Algo.   It was a fantastic experience. It started with the host who took the time to show us a few of the bottles in the wine refrigerator near the front door when we commented on how beautiful and inviting it is. He offered us a four top table even though there were only two of us and had been designated to a corner two top. He described a new cocktail so enticingly that I gad to try it and was not disappointed. Our server also described the new cocktail when she brought us a complimentary glass of cava. The menu is comforting but interesting, and everything was delicious. We shared the deviled eggs w four and the sweetbreads and grilled peaches. My entree was halibut and ratatouille, my husband had roast chicken and dumplings (which he never orders) and loved it. We finished it off with an apple tarts Normandy with dulce de Lethe ice cream, which like all the desserts is made in-house. I can't wait to go back."
"4.0","Caught this truck at the Bakery Square beach event this past weekend and I got the Bulgogi bowl with everything on it! I have to say that the Bulgogi tastes pretty close to my mom's which I was super surprised about, it was delicious. The little dumplings were so cute and tasty. There's a ton of veggies and rice, which was a little disappointing for me because they don't give you that much meat... but at least it tasted good. I think for the large rice: meat ratio, $10 is pretty pricey, but the flavors were definitely there."
"3.0","I have not been back. But, others have told me how wonderful the owners are.  So, I feel like I need to give them another chance.  When I check out, they are always very kind.   I feel that I should not be passive aggressive which is easy and my nature, but deal with the problem directly and speak with the owners; not aggressively but to solve problem or better understand it. I know that my experience is due to cultural difference. But, could you just delay me ten minutes due to biases and not  forty-five. That would be the difference between 'I'm ok. I get it. '. And being furious. Ill let you know if I am adult enough to speak with the owners and the outcome."
"5.0","To preface this: I rarely will make a Yelp review, but I had to make an exception for Fazio's. This is without a doubt my favorite pizza in the Bloomfield / Lawrenceville area. Perfect NY style slices with the perfect amount of cheese and sauce. Crust is top notch. We usually just get plain so not too sure about the toppings, but regular cheese is divine."
"4.0","I needed coffee to get me through a two hour drive home and I needed to charge my phone so this was clearly the place to come. The inside had a nice atmosphere and showcased local artists. I got a small mocha for $3.25 and it wasn't bad. Decent mocha that's leaps and bounds better than one you'd get at Starbucks. The baristas were great and didn't mind my friends and I sitting around with our coffees even when it was coming close to their closing time.The music wasn't super loud though that may change during the day and I can't attest to how well the sounds of conversation carry but there seemed to be a decent amount of places to sit if you wanted a change of scenery to get work done.Definitely worth coming here!"
"4.0","Was looking for dinner on the North Side and saw the positive yelp reviews, so decided to try Subba. The owner/chef was gracious and we were very happy with the food. I'd never eaten Nepali cuisine before, so we enjoyed the veggie Momo's and Nepali chicken. I thought the seasoning and spice level was spot on, and you can't beat the price. As others have said, expect the decor to be plain and unimpressive, but it is clean and bright with lots of 2nd floor windows. I also enjoyed the lovely background folk/flute music. We will absolutely eat here again next time we have an event on the North Side."
"5.0","Totally loved Morcilla and can't wait to go back. Street parking. Intimate atmosphere, friendly service and delicious food! I recommend reservations as we had reservations for 2 at 630 on a Monday and they were very busy. We were still served quickly despite how busy they were. Our server was so nice. When I told her I was pescatarian, she marked up my menu so I knew exactly what I could order. The Brussel sprouts snack was amazing! Shaved Brussels, feta, pomegranate with a sherry dressing. So flavorful and I only wish there was more! The warm bread snack with herbed oil was good but I think other snacks are more worth it. For small plates we went with the croquettes and fried sunchokes, both highly recommended by me. My husband thought the croquettes were a little bland for him but they're served with a honey dipping sauce and I enjoyed it. We shared the trout large place which was so buttery and delicious! We ate every piece! For dessert, you can't go wrong with the churros and chocolate hazelnut dipping sauce. Everything was so fresh and served hot, you could tell nothing sat in the kitchen. Husband and I shared 2 snacks, 2 small plates, 1 large plate and dessert. It was the perfect amount of food for us. Husband also had a cocktail and espresso. Total about $110 and worth every cent! If you like tapas, you've got to try Morcilla! Can't wait to come back!"
"4.0","I've eaten here a couple times now that I work on this side of the city and I've enjoyed the meals thoroughly! Their takeout service is really quick for lunch but I have also eaten in. My last meal there I ate in with a decent size group from work. We all order something different from the lunch menu. I ordered Beef w/ Broccoli and a shrimp egg roll. The egg roll came out first and it was delicious. A really nice size and packed with shrimp and veggies. The main dish came out and the sauce they use for the beef broccoli is pretty tasty. The water was decent and they do charge gratuity for a large groups more than 5.I will definitely be back if im in the mood for some quick and tasty Chinese Food."
"4.0","ran in for a quick lunch before an appointment.  waitress helpfullysuggested the soup of the day,which happened to be lentil and whichalso was delicious. great menu and was told the brunches are fab.  took a bananabut muffin to go and scarfed it down aftermy meeting.  perfect!  a don't miss vegan local if you are near lawrenceville!"
"4.0","On Wednesday I was part of a group of 12 Penn State wrestling fans that was here for an early dinner. They were very accommodating and the food and service was great. George and Clara were our servers and did a fantastic job. I will definitely be back and strongly recommend this place!!!"
"5.0","I can't just can't get enough of MR Bulgogi. I have a soft spots for food trucks, but out of all the options in Pittsburgh, MR Bulgogi is special. I have had both the bulgogi and pork bowls and both are so great. The bulgogi is perfectly cooked and incredibly flavorful and the sauces and sauce on the pork is next level. They're both so good, I'd recommend getting the half and half option. There is plenty of sticky rice in the bowls and lettuce in the sauces so you will be filled up. Each bowl is served with a dumpling and it's worth adding the side of dumplings and throwing them on top of your bowl or splitting with someone else to throw on your bowl. The kimchi is also another great side that I'd recommend throwing on top. MR Bulgogi is always awesome and you will not be disappointed!"
"1.0","It's a McDonalds....if you don't know what a McDonald's is please return to your home planet....or at least do some research on ours.  Do not entertain this location if you are looking for fast service.  I'm writing this review on a single visit as I am unlikely to return to this particular franchise.  I was here on a Friday morning at 6:44 AM and the place was relatively slow for a downtown location, there was approximately 5 patrons ahead of me at the time.  I call that out to really highlight the next portion, during this visit I ordered 2 Egg White Delight sandwiches.  I then proceeded to wait for 14 minutes before they were ready, there were several other patrons also waiting for the same sandwich for a similar extended period.        Whoever is managing the kitchen at this particular location has done a poor job.  It was clear that the runner at the front was doing her best to keep the anxiously waiting patrons happy as she stood there occasionally yelling the remaining items she was waiting on.  This woman deserved praise for her attempt to help keep the customers happy as her kitchen failed her.       This is a McDonald's and therefore is reviewed as such, while I am not expecting 5 star dining, I am expecting a quick in and out experience, otherwise I would go to another establissme , especially with all the choices downtown."
"5.0","Stopped in for breakfast one weekday when they were just opening and we had the place to ourselves. Everyone who works there is super friendly! You order at the counter and then seat yourself, but they bring the food out to you. I had the lox platter and it was very good - the smoked salmon was fresh and they gave plenty of toppings. Well worth the price! Will definitely be back again."
"5.0","This may be the most authentic Italian within the city of Pittsburgh. Each dish is made with fresh food and that can be found in the flavor of each bite. The restaurant is small but it gives a cozy ambiance. The best part is the guitarist that plays classic Italian hits throughout the restaurant.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a romantics dinner."
"5.0","Cozy, elegant, romantic, and delectable! Came here for dinner on a whim and was completely awestruck by the excellent service, delicious kebab mixed platter and sauced eggplant, and intimate atmosphere. Could not believe that this place has been open for 9 months already - where have we been?! Highest recommendation!"
"4.0","I like this place. I always stop in when visiting Pittsburgh and it never disappoints. I have never had the lunch buffet but dinner is always solid and reasonable.  If you are new to Indian get Samosas, Makhani Chicken, Naan and Raita sauce. Damn...."
"4.0","I ate here a lot due to its proximity to CMU. The food is almost always good, though there were a few misses. The desserts tend to be a little too sweet, or rich, or dry. The salads are very good. They had a tuna melt which I practically lived off of since it was big enough to make two meals, but last time I checked they took it off the menu. I would avoid the pizza if they have it."
"5.0","Amazing coffee shop. The layout is amazing with a cool balcony to sit on up in the back and big windows that open up on nice days. The coffee is great and they have a good selection of smoothies and juices as well if you don't like coffee."
"4.0","Cinderlands 3705 did a great job with a 2 story inside/outside remodel of the old building.  I was there for a lunch business meeting, so I can't talk about the beer offering at this point.  We started with 3 apps a soft pretzel, pierogis, and goat cheese curds.  The pierogis were fancier than most with the ingredients and were good.  The curds were very good as well with their sauce.  The soft pretzel was a basic soft pretzel and the cheese sauce did the trick.  For my meal I ordered the fried pig ear bahn mi.  It was a bit too hard core for me.  I couldn't get it down, but that's my fault I guess based on ordering a fried pig ear with pate.  The other entrees like grilled cheese and burgers looked good.  So if you don't like real bahn mi with pate don't risk it as adding a pig ear makes it more adventurous."
"3.0","My boyfriend and I went here after purchasing a groupon. For being a burger place I expected a little more flavor to my burger but it was very average overall. We both did make your own burgers and didn't realize until our food arrived now small the parties were. It was about the same size as a five guys 'little burger' but at a higher end burger place price. The fries were pretty good but nothing out of the ordinary. Our waitress was good and the overall decor was a modern/industrial feel. However, I don't think the food was good enough to get me back here anytime soon."
"4.0","As Thai food are getting more popular - there's a new one popping up all over the place. This one is on top of my list along with Thai Spoon, Pusadees and Banana Leaf. However, the price is slightly cheaper compared to the others and the food portions (depending on what you get) are pretty large for the price. The noodle bowls are ginormous and equally delicious.Not the fanciest restaurant in terms of decor but the service and food are top notch. Would definitely recommend stopping by."
"1.0","Sat down to order drinks with our slice of pizza from next door and they refused to serve us because we got a slice of pizza.  Who does that?! Bad business.... will never go here again!"
"3.0","Their 'vegan option' is just taking away ingredients leaving you with a very sad $5+taco"
"5.0","I dunno guys, I still really like their food. My mother wanted to get takeout from here for her birthday dinner today,  so here we came and back home we went. We ordered...Eggplant Parmigiana-Usually I can take or leave this dish, but their version is a keeper. The eggplant itself is fluffy yet a little crispy and is topped with excellent cheese and sauce.Spaghetti With Meatballs-You almost don't need the pasta as their meatballs are garlic-packed asteroids of rich meatiness. They seem to have only gotten larger  and even better since my last visit. Shrimp Fra Diavolo-This was creamy and mildly spicy with small shrimp to be found amongst the rigatoni. Yes, we were dealing with the Devil's Shrimp, but he'd have to be feelin' pretty peaceful 'n easy to indulge in this. We also got  the Chopped Antipasto Salad with that brilliant vinaigrette and the Mozzarella Garlic Bread which I'd love to put a gooey, dripping-with-sauce meatball between two slices of. I cannot say anything negative about the service here either. I don't think I waited more than five minutes for everything, and everyone was very mindful of me, making sure I was being taken care of and all. It may be a chain, but draw the word IMPRESSED on my stomach. They are a contender."
"5.0","So unbelievably pleased with the service and food! Stopped here for brunch and got pancakes and yogurt- both of which exceeded my expectations!"
"4.0","I'd really like to give this place 4 or 5 stars for the pizza, and a 1 for service.  I've had nothing but terrible experiences at this location which is a damn shame for Upper Lawrenceville.  The fact that I keep going back should tell you how much I enjoy the pizza. Issues I've had with staff include but are not limited to: 1) Randomly closing the doors on us AT LUNCHTIME and not letting us in when we could see that there were customers inside (this has happened to me TWICE) 2) Aloof and rude employees not acknowledging when I'm standing at the counter and they're too busy chatting. 3) Downright lying about the ingredients in the sauce because they were too lazy to fix their mistake and remake the pizza that they messed up. (they put pesto sauce on my pizza when I asked for white garlic. My significant other called them out on  this, informing them that I have a nut allergy and pesto will kill me. They still wouldn't admit their wrongdoing or remake the pizza)4) Just today, an employee skipped over my sister and I in line and rolled his eyes at us because we wanted salads (which were small and terrible by the way).  He angrily shouted 'okay who here is gettin' a pizza?!' without addressing us further than the initial eye roll. He then filled the next customer's order and proceeded to take 5 minutes to shuffle around and slowly pull out salad bowls, which were not hidden, but in plain sight.  Even though we ordered standard salads off the menu, he made us tell him what to put on these salads, and rolled his eyes even more when we told him to add garlic, because that meant he had to pull out a knife and cutting board. Long story short, there's a reason that this location is rated 3 stars versus the downtown location which is currently rated at 4 stars.  If you're in Lawrenceville and you want a delicious, quick, cheap pizza, be prepared to deal with dishonest, angry, aloof employees (there are a few good employees, but they're far outnumbered).  Oh, and don't bother with a salad.EDIT: CHANGED MY REVIEW TO 4 STARS FROM 3 BECAUSE THE SERVICE HAS IMPROVED."
"4.0","Don't go here for the ambiance. Go for the delicious, cheap and plentiful food options. I would recommend the chicken shawarma w/ the french fries!! I think they double fry their fries...they are amazing, and I am usually not a french fry person. I also got the chicken tikka masala meal which was just okay. They use huge chunks of white meat and the sauce is poured over the rice, so it was on the dry side. Very large portion for around $8. The grape leaves were meh, probably some of the least favorite I have tried. Their galub jamun was super overdone."
"5.0","The Place: Clean, CasualThe Service: Inviting, Friendly, Quick The Food: Great Variety, Flavorful, Large Family Style PortionsHighly Recommend General Tso's Chicken & Beef, Pork Fried Rice, and their Fruity Cocktails! ;-)"
"5.0","I'm giving this a five solely because these guys are awesome and they can cook. The funnel cake dipped cannoli bites are phenomenal.  I've spent years looking for this truck. I recently got to try their actual food and it's good. It's just heavy for lunch so I couldn't finish my grilled chicken and cous cous.  As far as flavor goes these guys have flavor. My grilled chicken played well with the spinach, kale, escarole,  red pepper and cheese building upon layers of flavor. This reminds me of something I'd eat in the fall. It's like a warm salad in a bowl. If you ever get a chance to try the funnel cake dipped cannoli, go for it. It'll change your life. Thank me later!"
"2.0","I've had Shawerma that melts in your mouth.  Not here. The sandwich is more like a wrap than a traditional Shawerma - I should have realized that when they asked if I wanted Provolone on it. It's not that bad, it's just not what one thinks of when ordering a Shawerma.  Their version has the meat, herbs, onions, tomato, and lettuce tightly wrapped in something a little thicker than a tortilla but a lot thinner than pita bread.  It's also kind of on the expensive side - $8 without a side.  Most people were ordering salads.  Perhaps that's what I should have done."
"5.0","I adore this place. DELICIOUS food, great prices. Not a fancy or snooty establishment - quite a hole in the wall type place. I recommend the pho with beef or chicken, with the fresh spring roll appetizer."
"3.0","Haven't been to a Brueggers in years.  This one has a great location and is probably one of the only fast service style restaurants in Walnut Street area.  While I was here I just had a simple everything bagel toasted w/cream cheese.  It hit the spot.  Still as good as I remember them."
"1.0","The rudest customer service I have experienced in Pittsburgh. I will not be coming back."
"5.0","I can't believe that no one else has reviewed this yet.  This is the perfect neighborhood bar.  While most of Walnut street is pretty corporate, Cappy's is still there and still local with a nice group of regulars. I am writing this review today because I love LOVE love the hot pretzel sticks - not on the menu but I was still able to order them. Other reasons to love Cappy's:-outside seating in the summer-affordable, tasty food- they don't fry the french fries and they are still really great-Fridays are usually Cappy-oke Night and the place is packed (IheartPGH is not a kaeroke fan but she appreciates that others are)Rumor has it that a few east end singles have met their future spouses at Cappy's.I even like that the ads in the bathroom stalls have not been updated in something like 3 years.  And I really like the Pittsburgh and Shadyside cross stitched samplers that hang on the walls, I know it sounds strange, but it just fits in this place."
"5.0","Ryan H.  Was a great server.  The large steak fries are awesome and they make a great burger cooked to perfection.  I didn't love the red beard sauce and that is because I don't like mustard if you love mustard go for it.  I would order without the sauce next time.  Why Ryan was so great we came in after the steelers game place was packed.  He said it would be better to get our whole order at once before the crowd grew and it did.  Saved us a ton of time.  Had a great experience."
"5.0","A five-star local bar. We came for a beer (looking pretty dusty and beat because we are rehabbing a house around the corner) and we stayed for a meal. Have been back often. All we expected was bar food and we have had meals that are inventive and carefully prepared. We always feel welcome in the mixed-age crowd. We are curious about the live entertainment and game nights, but haven't been yet due to exhaustion from the construction process. Best meals are sandwiches."
"2.0","Stopped in for a beer after leaving a recent Pirates game early (it was cold!). Rather nondescript place, devoid of any personality--seems like they're going for an upscale sports bar vibe--but I think they just opened the week before, so I'll allow them some growing pains. Odd scene: they had sound on for Pirates game, then, as Bucs were two batters from closing out the game, they start blasting music? After Pirates game ends (as does the one song), they put sound back on for Pens game. Inexplicably, in last two minutes of that game, they again start blasting music? Weird.Anywho, after a couple beers, my buds and I headed out into the night. Don't think I'd come back on my next trip to the 'Burgh."
"4.0","A great place to go for Mexican when you are Downtown.  The Menu has some interesting stuff on it and is priced very fairly.Make sure to get chips and salsa to start with, they are very good.  The guacamole is also tasty.One thing that I did not like was that they had a 'Las Velas' and a 'Las Velas Guest' WiFi network and when I asked for the password, they told me that their WiFi was not for customers.  Why have the guest network then?"
"5.0","Attentive quality service and high-quality tasty food. Hidden in a hole in the ground on a Shadyside side street - we only found it by accident - the atmosphere of this hole in the wall/ground is sort of like a stone grotto. We had a delicious green salad, a perfect chicken Marsala, and also a spicy homemade sausage with cheese, peppers and onions. If you're a celiac, they offer gluten free pasta as an alternative for all their pasta dishes. Cozy atmosphere. Great find."
"3.0","Solid burger...Solid staff...soft fries.It was still new when I went. Atmosphere is little cold and suburban shopping plaza'ish.Buuuut I have to say, best burger in Lawrenceville...so far."
"4.0","I don't know if we would have made it into here if they hadn't been open on Sundays but I'm so glad we did. Our waiter was one of the best servers I have ever had. So knowledgeable about everything on the menu and was able to give us other awesome recommendations for after-dinner drinks. My husband and I both really enjoyed our cocktails- he had the Bramble On and I had the Special Tea. We tried the house made mozzarella, the greens and beans, the gnocchi and the cavatelli. I'm not going to get into the details but seriously, everything was phenomenal and the prices were awesome for the portions. It's a shame I've missed out on this place for the past few years of visiting Pittsburgh but we will definitely be back next time we visit."
"1.0","Sloppy service!!!  Spoke to Mgr Philip he did care and was NO help!!!  I told him the prep cook was eating while prep fooding the meat and cheese plates . I was furious as waitress took our order but never put it into system until she took a party of 10 order.  The food was not special I would never return."
"4.0","I finally tested Peppi's out last week in the Strip District on a Saturday afternoon.  Living in Squirrel Hill and going to school at CMU, I am a die-hard fan of Uncle Sam's subs, and I go there quite frequently.  I'm surprised that no one has compared Peppi's and Uncle Sam's because they are practically identical, minus Uncle Sam's throwing in free fries if you eat in.I ordered a cheesesteak ($7.22 w tax), after all of the cashiers agreed that it was one of the best sandwiches on the menu.  As promised, it was a delicious sandwich.  The bread was nice and fresh and the steak was good.  Additionally, the people working there were very friendly as well.  The portion was huge, and I got a meal and a snack out of my sub.If you are looking for a quick sit-down or to-go lunch, Peppi's is a great place in the Strip for just that."
"3.0","I'm confused by CityWorks as it seems to be in the throes of an identity crisis. While marketed as a sports bar with 90 or so beers on tap and multiple large screen TVs... the menu doesn't match... nor does the occasional DJ spinning giving it more of a nightclub feel. I understand the modern day sports (wo)man may have a more sophisticated palate... I'm not sure they're interested in duck confit as they're watching the Steelers and chugging beers. Aside from my opinion of the menu vs atmosphere, the menu lacks uniformity and consistency - it feels like a weird mix of items.  Also the three or so times I've been there, the food has come out long after we ordered. The plus side is the food is good and there is a lot of space."
"5.0","Great authentic food! Come here about once every 6 weeks and always enjoy my meal! Would recommend if you like trying something authentic and unique"
"2.0","I like the hotpot wings 干锅鸡翅 and shredded potatoes 小椒土豆丝，they are tasty.The restaurant is very unsanitary though. The table is greasy and the waitresses seem really untrained. They sometimes talk really loudly while you are dining as if you don't exist... If it were for those dishes I would never step back into that place."
"4.0","Had lunch today July 4. Everything was presented nicely and tasty. If not overpriced but that seems to be the trend in the strip District. This place has a warehouse decor acoustics are pretty bad music is pretty bad I think you're trying to be too many things either sports bar or a seafood restaurant. They should pick one and stick with it. Nothing was really terrible but the large warehouse atmosphere leaves a bit to be desired as it's pretty noisy and then the music added to the noise"
"5.0","Our food and service were exemplary.  It is definitely a place where the locals go. My super bubble drink was exquisite. All a good time with great food."
"4.0","I'm definitely a fan, even though they are new and still clearly ironing out some kinks. The most important thing is my wrap was delicious. I'm still thinking about it. I had the mexican kind of wrap -- can't remember the name -- with falafel. So good. The cilantro lime dressing was amazing, the tortilla was fresh, and it was all perfectly wrapped, which was awesome -- I hate when a wrap falls apart. We came at noon and it took a LONG time. Like 30 minutes to get the wrap. And then halfway through eating it my friend an I both realized we were missing the add on (her chicken, me falafel). I was annoyed because their food is not cheap as it is and it was 2 extra dollars to add the protein. I'm glad we decided to eat in since we noticed while we were still there. BUT, they are new and mistakes happen, the important thing is how they deal with it which they did very well. The manager offered us three choices -- give us the protein on the side, remake the wrap, or give us a refund. My friend chose her chicken on the side and I asked to have mine remade since I didn't want to upwrap the wrap. She had it fixed within one minute and gave us comp cards for a free meal. Awesome customer service. I can't wait to go back but next time I'll probably make a point to show up at 11:45 or 1pm rather than right at noon with the downtown lunch crowd."
"5.0","4.5 stars.Enjoyed my night here with a mix of sake, cocktails, and small dishes. Fresh sushi is hard to find in Pittsburgh, but Umami delivers very well with their fresh sushi selections. Highly recommend the yellowtail if you haven't tried it yet. The skewers were also great, as there were many options, with ample quantities of meat on then.Atmosphere can be a bit loud, especially with the DJ and lots of people in the small room, but it's a fun time.Overall, the ability to try a variety of high quality Japanese dishes and an exciting restaurant vibe made for a memorable experience."
"1.0","I don't even wanna give them one star. I order from them regularly and while never am really impressed, I order again. but after tonight, never again.... After placing a $38 dollar order for a large broc chicken Alfredo pizza, there was barely any broc, almost no chicken, and no sauce what soever... One of the worst pizzas I've ever had. The side salad we ordered with cheese, had no cheese... Two unripe tomatoes and looked like it was sitting out all day.  Finally,,, I called to complain... The rude ass guy on the phone interrupted me mid sentence and said hold on, I'm getting the manager. After ten minutes, he gets back on, says' I can't find him' and HANGS UP on me!!!!!Wtf?!!!!!! NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!"
"1.0","To put it simply, this restaurant needs a new name.  Fresh i the last word I think of here.  I ordered the Buffalo Chicken salad with the dressing on the side, by the time I sorted through the slimy lettuce I was left with blue cheese, carrots, old mushy tomatoes, and old dried out celery.  I was too afraid of getting food poisoning from the lettuce I ended up throwing everything away.  Very disappointed, I will never return. On top of the terrible experience, I paid an absurd amount fr the quality."
"5.0","The concept is really interesting. While most of the items served are still somewhat bar food to an extent, having different cultural influences does give it a lot of variety that you can't find anywhere else. While I wouldn't call everything on the menu 'street food' (particularly the two that we got, as they were huge), one can see that they are carefully designed and made. I am guessing that the prices inform the portion that you would expect to get.For the roast pork, it came with a ton of seasoned meat on a flavorful and cheesy roll, with several pieces of perfectly grilled broccoli rabe. What was surprising was how well seasoned everything was, particularly with the herbs and spices embedded into the pork. and bread. Same story with the brick chicken, in which the chicken breast meat was actually quite tender, with a very flavorful layer of liver smeared on the roll underneath. The fries for both were also really well seasoned with herbs and topped with cheese pieces. Environment is nice and casual with background music but not too loud. There's a bar area but it's definitely meant as more of a bar/restaurant hybrid. The wait for the food was a bit long but totally worth it."
"3.0","Average sushi restaurant - food ok, not really the freshest.  Prices very reasonable."
"5.0","Great sandwiches, fresh bread, and delicious desserts. Excellent espresso and the kids thought they made  great eggs."
"1.0","What is up with this location? The place is filthy. The servers are less than helpful. The food took forever. The restroom was a mess. Awful experience, considering how fortunate they are to have this location."
"5.0","I am both vegan and gluten free and was so in love with the experience at B52! My girlfriend and I got the hummus with the GF bread and I would go back just for that, it was easily the best hummus and GF bread I've had. We both got the Tofu Scramble and the Falafel Salad. The Falafel is definitely the best I have ever had. My girlfriend also had the peppermint hot chocolate and loved it. Everything was amazing. The only thing is I wish the thad GF pancake option. We can't wait to go back!!"
"1.0","Order was not ready until 30 minutes after I got an alert that it was ready for pickup. Didn't get so much as an apology from anyone working there."
"4.0","if you're going out to vietnamese for the food, go here. if you're going out for the ambiance, go somewhere else. when you walk into tram's, you'll be seated and handed menus and approximately 45 seconds later be asked if you're ready to order yet. the staff is pretty get-in-get-out-get-going style. it is byob though, which is pretty cool too.i ordered the beef pho soup. i really enjoyed it. like i said, if you're going for the food itself, you should definitely check this place out, it's pretty damn good."
"5.0","if only every thai place was this good. huge portions for take-out, amazing rolls, wonderful stir-fries and curries. plus we placed a huge take-out order and it came completely accurate, with each dish labeled. a rare treat."
"5.0","So so good. I am a big fan of the NY style pizza and Benny's doesn't disappoint and the jumbo slices are so awesome. They are like the equivalent of two regular NY style slices at some other pizza shops and only $4 per slice. They have a limited number of toppings to choose from which is how it should be. I got the cheese pizza and really loved the super thin crust that was both chewy and crispy."
"5.0","Jerome Bettis' Grille is my boyfriend and I's (almost) weekly spot. We go here one a week, every chance we get.  Not only is the atmosphere relaxing and welcoming, the staff is also friendly and helpful. One personal reason that I enjoy coming is due to the extensive gluten free menu. I have a severe gluten allergy, so finding a place to eat out that is accommodating is a rarity. The grille has a separate kitchen for gluten free items, and they always come out on circular plates. My personal favorites include the nachos, buffalo wings, and grilled chicken burger, which comes with fries!Out of all of the times that we have eaten here (too many to count) I have never gotten sick. I love this place and would recommend to anyone! We have had many waiters, since we come here often, but George is by far the best. He is knowledgeable, friendly, prompt, and helpful. He informed us about the gluten free kitchen and plates, checked up on us often, and ensured that we had our food/drinks as soon as available to him. Thank you for another great experience!"
"4.0","It's your typical dive bar. You can't go in with too high of expectations. The drinks are reasonably priced and the bartenders are very friendly. If it's busy and there's only one bartender... be patient. They have lots of food specials throughout the week. I haven't had anything that's blown me away, but it's not bad. Definitely a chill environment. Trivia night is my personal favorite."
"1.0","We walked in and sat down at the counter. We were never greeted and proceeded to sit for close to 10 minutes with no acknowledgement. We got up and left. As we were walking out one of the waitresses yelled 'Thanks for coming' to which my reply was ' Thanks for not serving us'. I will never go back. Save yourself the time and effort and go somewhere else."
"5.0","As good as it gets for a Qdoba. Seriously, it's a Qdoba. It's good and tastes like Qdoba. What are people expecting?"
"1.0","This review is specific to this location.  We love hello in other locals.Dirty, out of the following: Romain lettuce, avacado, ketchup, ice.  Workers clearly hated each other.  Selected salad items waited for 9 minutes before someone came to dress and cut.  6 people in party..it took more than 30 minutes for us all to be served.  Our frustration we kept to ourselves.  Others in restaurant flipped a lid on staff.  Take a picture, as that is only way you will see me there ever again."
"5.0","My five stars are based solely on how delicious the vegetarian tacos are - they're so robust & tasty.  They include rice & beans, fabulous grilled poblanos with cheese melted on, and some other toppings.  They're even better when you add the medium-hot sauce that comes on the side with each order - the flavor is incredibly complex.  Love these veggie tacos so much.  (Side note, also ordered chips & salsa which were far inferior.  But the veggie tacos!!)"
"2.0","The one worker told us there was a 20-30 wait & sent me an app to yelp. The app never told were we stood in line so we back over to the hostess. We came back over after 25min to find out from another worker that there was no wait & he should have told us that. It was frustrating to hear because we were really hungry. My husband got a Margarita that tasted awful & was over salted. The crab cakes were bland & had no flavor. The lobster roll was small & not filling for my husband."
"4.0","Loved the chicken taco. Added the habanero cholula for an extra kick. I don't typically like avocado, but it wasn't overwhelming and the components of the taco with the warm shell made for an enjoyable bite. Great prices too!"
"2.0","OK. I came here for breakfast since most of the usual Bloomfield breakfast places were closed in preparation for the annual Italian Festival. Wrong move.Well, I'm the only one in the place, and I waited a long time for my food. I got the American breakfast which consisted of eggs, ham, potatoes, and a roll and coffee. I hated the coffee, but I am a 'coffee snob,' so I'll give them that. The eggs were not flipped over, as requested, and the roll was bordering on stale. Good potatoes, good ham.Overpriced? You bet! Not coming back."
"5.0","The food was very good and our server Brennan was one of the best we've ever had. The prices are a bit high but you get large portions and the food is worth it. We got the chicken marsala   And the sauce that came with it was wonderful. Not too heavy and a slight sweetness to it."
"1.0","There pizza never tastes the same Also if you order a salad always ask for dressing because they will not offer any. There are other better pizza places in the area."
"5.0","Through the years I have been to Alexander's Italian Bistro for private gatherings, lunch, dinner, and just meeting a friend for drinks.Although I was born and raised in Pittsburgh, I live in Alexandria, VA. This restaurant is my 'go to' place if I want great food with great friends.    Kelly took my order and said 'NO PROBLEM' when I asked if they would prepare a large order of food. I wanted to send dinners to the police officers processing the crime site following murders at Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh.  Luckily, my friend could pick it up and deliver it to the precinct.       It made my day that Alexander's were able to understand what was being requested and whipped up a huge dinner (soup to nuts) and that my friend was willing and able to run it to the police.       Nothing finer than ensuring those who protect and serve are having good, soli meals during a trying time."
"5.0","I can't tell you how many times I passed this gem up, simply because when I'm in the Strip, I feel obligated to go for food from another culture entirely (I do curry or sushi here a lot).So when I was looking for a place to please a group of four friends, I didn't think of Cafe Raymond. However, we were all hungry enough that we stumbled in to the closest place: I am SO glad it was this place.Once we got in, it was obvious we'd be waiting a bit to order (the line for lunch on a Sunday is no joke!) so we took our time scoping out the menu. I have to say, I was impressed by their wide range of tantalizing options!I ended up landing on the Veggie Muffaletta, served on focaccia bread. First impression: This sandwich is massive! Definitely 2 meals, unless you go starving hungry. And it tasted Amazing. Like a folded homemade focaccia made by a loving Italian grandma.Friends got The Club, a Spinach, Mushroom and Feta Omelette, and the special of the day: Italian Style Eggs Benedict, which I tried. It was really wonderful... I liked my Veggie Muffaletta just a TAD bit more.Next for me to try: Coffeehouse Burger! I'm not usually a burger gal, but it just sounds STELLAR.I'd say this place is a must-try. With everything made from scratch and deliciously fresh ingredients, you're bound to love Raymond!"
"2.0","We were in the neighborhood so we decided to eat at Qdoba for lunch.  I like that Qdoba makes nachos with your chips on the side so they don't get soggy.  We were greeted nicely when we went in.  It took us a moment to order because I was considering a few options, including a quesadilla.  However the nachos won out.  I added chicken at the last minute.  I picked out all of the items that I wanted on my nachos and paid for my meal.  I looked for a table to sit at but the ones that weren't occupied needed wiped off.  I finally wiped on off myself.  I sat down to eat.  I looked down at my nachos and became disappointed.  They had not strained the chicken before putting it in with my toppings and the grease from the chicken had pooled on top of my nachos.  I was hungry so I ate around it.  It was unappealing to look at.  I think if I go back I'll try another dish but I'm definitely in no rush to go back."
"4.0","Small, clean, little, family owned and operated. I stopped here for breakfast as I waited for my car to get fixed and I was delighted to have a good breakfast for what I paid. I hung out for about an hour, ownership was friendly with every customer and clearly happy to serve their repeat customers. This place is perfect to pick up a quick lunch, or breakfast on the go as the name eludes to. My favorite part of this place is that the prices aren't trying to be anything more than fair and the chef/staff is more than willing to make any substitutions or alterations to your order for you without a problem. I mean, this isn't going to be the best you've ever had and it doesn't try to be. It's the equivalent of a to-go diner, but the attitude of the ownership/staff and the variety of options makes this place a reasonable option should you be in the area. It makes you WANT to give them business. Great for a quick bite any day of the week."
"4.0","I'm so thrilled there are more ramen restaurants in Pittsburgh and I think it's what downtown needed. Yuzu is off the beaten path so I hope it doesn't become forgotten, as the ramen is pretty good and perfect for a cold day in Pittsburgh. When my husband and I stopped in for lunch, surprisingly there was no one in the restaurant. It made us nervous at first but my rayu paitan ramen and his tang tang mien noodles proved to us that Yuzu was a gem. I also couldn't help but notice how big the bar was, which I plan to return for happy hour one of these days!"
"2.0","Good food. Service was horrible. One of the workers was extremely rude and made comments about what his customers were wearing. He claimed he was going to kick out his customers for wearing low cut shirts. The other workers just laughed it off. Whoever owns this place should learn to hire respectful staff. Shame because they're tacos were actually decent."
"5.0","Tacos are not usually a huge hit with me when I go to a Mexican restaurant - I like them, but they are usually not exceptional. The tacos made out on the street outside of Reyna Foods in the Strip - awesome, and definitely the best tacos I have had anywhere. The ingredients are all great, but the grilled flavor of the tortilla and the fresh ingredients, included the freshly squeezed lime juice, complete everything and make every bite wonderful. The beef tongue and fish tacos were fantastic. Also, if you like some heat, try their homemade sauces in the big plastic jars at the end of the line. Now this is street food, baby!"
"4.0","This is definitely a go-to place anytime I'm in Pittsburgh.Cool place with a chill vibe.  Staff has always been friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.Almost all of their menu sounds delicious. But like a drug, I can't seem to stay away from the Steel City Lobster Roll (Chunks of cold water lobster meat, sauteed in garlic butter, served on a bun with fresh cut seasoned fries, smothered with house made lobster bisque and creme fraiche). But unlike other seafood places, Wholey's does NOT skimp on the meat...large pieces of whole lobster claw meat! And the lobster bisque they cover the sandwich with is great. I love when they give you a bit extra so you can dip your fries in it too.Some day I'll try something else (having only ever had this sandwich is why I only gave 4 stars), but for now the Steel City Lobster Roll keeps me coming back on its own."
"5.0","Really enjoy the locally driven menu and you can taste the freshness. Meat hangs over the bun, great local beers, dressing for salad were all delicious."
"1.0","Ew is the best word to describe this place.  I don't know why pizza places offer pasta if they can't do it right.  I ordered the fetticine alfredo and it tasted like a frozed michelina dinner.  Noodles stuck together, incredibly overcooked, and the sauce was like something straight out of a ragu can.  Husband ordered a gyro and it was incredibly greasy and tasted like reheated frozen gyro meat.  Nothing we ordered tasted fresh and definitely not worth the money.  Stay away!!"
"4.0","Truly a great experience every time I come here. This restaurant serves up some seriously good tapas and the service is always great. That being said, keep in mind that the dishes are smaller as they are 'tapas' so it is a little pricy. But, it's definitely a good place to come for a date and if you're looking to share and try a bunch of dishes!"
"5.0","The food here blew me away - no exaggeration. My mom loved it too, and she's picky! The food here puts tapas restaurants from San Francisco to shame. Highlights (hard to pick out what we liked best because it was all so delicious):- Salmon crudo - holy moly, how do they get the mushrooms so crispy? The salmon melted in my mouth and the apples were perfectly spiced.- Who cooks for you farm mesclun green salad - More mushroom amazingness mixed into crisp greens and tangy dressing. I usually hate goat cheese, but I couldn't get enough of the smoked one in this salad. The smokiness cancels out the gaminess which is what I can't stand about garden variety goat cheese. - Jamon Iberico - super thinly sliced and full of flavor especially when paired with the marcona almonds that come on top of this dish- Queso en aceite - bread so warm i had to wait before I could comfortably handle it, flavorful manchego cheese that isn't too salty, and fragrant olive oil - hints of orange zest. Ah! We swiped every last drop of olive oil from the dish.- Crema catalina - Mom won't stop raving about this dessert even though it ended hours ago. It's more like a parfait with a candied nut layer on the bottom, a citrusy ice cream in the middle, and maple-flavored whipped topping (denser than whipped cream but fluffier than pudding) on top. I've never tasted anything like it, and I pray I'm lucky enough to someday taste it again. The attentive service (fresh plates ever 2-3 dishes, constant water refills) was the icing on the cake to an incredible dining experience."
"4.0","When I worked in town, I ate here every week, and loved it, but after retiring 2 years ago, I was never in town until this weekend.  The food is as good as it ever was and they have remodeled the inside.Wonton soup was great, as well as the sweet and sour chicken, Kung bow chicken, and chicken fried rice.Service is always good and the fortune cookies crisp.  Don't forget when you read your fortune to add the words 'in bed' at the end.  Makes for a better fortune."
"4.0","This is probably some of the best drunk food in the strip, neck and neck with Primantis.  I used to eat here a good bit working locally, but it kind of became too heavy to eat for lunch.  Their portions are fabulous and they have or at last had a great lunch special, Italian sub, fries and a drink for like 8 bucks.  Not bad, but you could seriously split it, because you will be sleeping when you get back to your desk.  Great stop on occasion, but too much for a regular stop."
"1.0","The bartender wasn't very friendly. Actually, just asked for my check and threw it at me! Classy."
"2.0","Historic Place for sure, lots of old world charm. The oysters are also old, as in not fresh. The first clue is that they come pre-shucked and served in a plastic cup already in cocktail sauce to cover for the fact they have little to no taste. Cool spot for a beer and then move on to someplace to eat."
"3.0","Boy was it warm in there today! My husband and I had been before on the weekend with friends and it must not have been summer. We had to move to sit closer to a fan and debated leaving altogether due to the heat. It's a small cozy food spot with coffee and boozy options. When I asked about the cocktails (that are on their wall in chalk) I was told there was a pause, a sigh, and a 'not right now- I can't'. It was after 12 so it doubt it was a liquor licensing issue. I suppose it was an overwhelmed worker issue. I ordered the oats because I wasn't super hungry. They had lots of delicious options on the menu but it was so warm in there I couldn't imagine how much more uncomfortable I would be with a hot meal. My husband ordered the avocado omelet was and I had the oats. The oats were what you would expect them to be. It was fine and appropriately priced at 4 bucks with a bit of fruit on top. I wished they were a bit sweeter but they were a nice fresh, cool, and healthy option. His omelette was so delicious!! The omelette itself had so much delicious flavor. The salsa was fresh and balanced it perfectly. It came with the option of a salad or potatoes. Both were great. Our friend had he breakfast sandwich and it was filling and delicious according to him. It's my second time here- food has been great both times and they have amazing options. It definitely keeps this place flooding. The service and atmosphere not so much. I had a little bit of an attitude from our server last time too and thought it might have been a one time thing. Might be the standard. Probably won't be back but if you're not easily offended and just want a fresh good meal then check it out!"
"1.0","I live in walking distance from Cappy's and was eager to try it. I notice it does a brisk business so I figured the food would be decent. My husband and I went one night in August (full disclosure: we had been working on our house all day, so we were starving and disoriented by the heat, and I was about 9 weeks pregnant and experiencing a persistent low-grade nausea all day). On this particular moment in my pregnancy I was violently craving a Caesar salad. I scoured the internet for places on Walnut and Ellsworth that *might* offer a decent Caesar, couldn't really determine which would be best, and we finally decided on Cappy's. Honestly? This was the worst - I mean aboslute worst! - excuse for a Caesar salad that I have ever encountered. It was made with iceberg lettuce (!?) and the dressing was more like a bottled light Italian than a creamy Caesar. It was terrible! My husband got a Rachel sandwich - the turkey version of a reuben - and he also said it was mediocre. I think this would be a fun place to go back to to have a couple of beers while sitting outside. But in the future I will stay away from the food. I don't think I would even try an appetizer next time."
"4.0","I had a very enjoyable afternoon here with friends. We had beers and snacks and sat upstairs in the loft area and played games. They have a variety of board games and card games and Jenga available up in the loft area. The chicharrones with beer cheese were delicious. My friend got the pierogies and did not care for them. Overall a great spot."
"5.0","Loved it.  Went in for Happy Hour Friday night and brunch the next morning.  Great beer selection with very knowledgeable staff. The happy hour prices were really good in the happy hour food was excellent. Loved the bloody Mary bar at brunch and the food was again excellent."
"4.0","Great taco restaurant on Southside. Their ingredients always taste fresh, and everything goes together very well. Prices since this review are $3/taco. All of their tacos are phenomenal (beef, pork, chicken, never tasted vegetarian). Nachos are decent, but I think their strength lies in their main course. They offer corn or flour tortilla which can be grilled to perfection. The only gripe I have is that their seating is very limited to about 10-12, and they can get super busy!"
"4.0","I see a lot of potential with Freshii. I would give them 5 stars if they weren't too shy with the seasoning in some food items like flavorless rice or the parfaits."
"5.0","Our daughter suggested Stagioni for dinner on Friday night.  From the very beginning with the mozzarella appetizer we knew this restaurant was special.  Main courses were all delicious and the desserts were better than anything we have ever tasted.  My husband and I live in Chicago and I wish I could take this restaurant back with us.  Great service and great food.  A wonderful treat before we head back to Chicago."
"5.0","I really loved this new, New American restaurant in Pittsburgh on my recent trip! It's a pretty tiny establishment with only a handful of tables, so I'd definitely recommend reservations. My friend made ours for a Thursday night and we were seated promptly. The restaurant welcomes guests with a complimentary pour of some bubbles. I wasn't drinking, but thought this was a nice touch. I asked about mocktails and our server said the bartenders could make me something with a little guidance. She suggested ginger and citrus which sounded good to me. I was rewarded with an effervescent and refreshing cocktail with some fancy cherries - it was delicious and I didn't feel like I was missing out while my friends sipped their wine. Onto the food. To start, I had the ceviche, which was a generous portion served on tortilla chips. Next was the halibut main. This was probably the best seafood entree I've had so far this fall. The fish was seared perfectly and served over a really interesting combo of barley and baby bok choy. I loved the textures and flavors! Meanwhile, my friend who ordered the ribeye found it to be a bit overcooked. The manager was open to her feedback and handled the situation perfectly.   I'm so glad I saved room for dessert, because their sweets were also among my favorite this season! I had some sort of apple/cheesecake/salted caramel hybrid that was simply out of this world! Just rehashing this meal is making me long for it again! I'll definitely plan a return to Siempre Algo on my next Pittsburgh trip."
"2.0","Same people, same food as its predecessor Star of India, only it's nearly twice as expensive--and there's no lunch buffet.  It looks almost as though they've given up on getting students in for lunch and want professors and administrators instead.Will concede that the renovation has made it much more attractive, but pretty art doesn't taste very good."
"3.0","I thought they had a pretty creative iced tea selection. I liked the ambiance, and the sandwich I ate was pretty good. I feel like as a first time customer, for not a very busy time of day, I wasn't given the best customer service. I was confused as to which line to be in and what was coming to my seat and what I had to get at the calendar. Nobody was really helping and when I asked I kind of got a snippy comment in regards to not being at my table or something and then i ended up standing and waiting for a good few minutes, meanwhile I'm trying to juggle my three year old. so I left still not understanding a simple pick up food concept. I'll try it again there because I did like the options but I hope for friendlier staff next time."
"4.0","Las Velas is not recognizable as you are walking through Market Square but if you look up from the Diamond Market, there it stands! You walk up a flight of stairs and then just somewhat awkwardly wait at the top of the steps for someone to seat you. It was a very busy Sunday in Pittsburgh (Pride/Arts Festival) so they were busy and somewhat understaffed so I noticed people somewhat confused and possibly frustrated waiting to be seated. I met my party there so I did not personally experience this, just observed it! As for the food, definitely an A rating. Yum! I ordered the chicken fajita ($15.50) and it was purely perfection! Drenched in oil- the chicken, peppers and onions complemented one another beautifully and it totally satiated me, not to mention it is healthy and gluten free (as long as you don't eat the tortillas). If you are somewhat concerned about healthy choices when you go out, I think it is important to note that the tortillas, rice, refried beans, pico, guacamole, sour cream, cheese is served on a separate plate. You can always just ask for your pico and guac on the side without all those naughty extras! Up to you, just something to note. I think $15.50 is a little steep considering that their lunch pricing (available M-F) is $10 but who am I kidding?! I would still order it again at that price point! The food is fresh and good quality. Las Velas salsa was nothing to write home about but you could tell the ingredients were fresh! Also, if you go on the website, the food and drinks pretty much look exactly the same in person! The atmosphere is simple yet fun and the restaurant does overlook Market Square, which is an added bonus. There is free parking after 6pm, 2 hour limited pay parking before 6pm or valet. This information can be found on their website. I would recommend Las Velas if you are in the mood for fresh, Mexican food in a nice location."
"1.0","I used to like this place for a well balanced light lunch.  They have seemed to have Americanized the menu by raising prices, creating larger portions and serving  totally bland food.  My butter chicken tasted like tomato soup. I will not go back."
"5.0","I heard so much about this place and wanted to try it for some time. The situation was perfect when the traffic and parking on Penn Avenue were telling me to go no further.  As I walked in, I was pleasantly surprised by the large, orderly space.  I was quickly greeted at the counter, where I placed my order for a chicken shawarma salad.  After being given a number to display on my table, I sat down and enjoyed watching the activity and meals around me.  Within minutes, my meal arrived.  The lettuce was fresh, the chicken was abundant and steaming, and dressings were provided.  As I sat eating my flavorful meal, I noted the food items I saw others eating and resolved to return and try a variety.  I also noted the steady stream of people at the counter, which moved quickly for a Sunday afternoon lunch rush.I was impressed by the smooth operation of this establishment.  Most notably, the service throughout my visit was so friendly and gracious toward all customers that I observed.  I look forward to returning!"
"4.0","Lunch menu updated. Service better this visit. Early lunch, so it's calm. The egg roll is sub par but had since crispy shell. Seems like it's reheated in a microwave. Quite a wait for main course. But it was worth the wait. Large portion.Asparagus shrimp lunch, white rice. Good. Won ton soup, good but too salty. Will alter your order for taste"
"5.0","I really love this joint. It is small and casual. The menu changes regularly, and there is always a vegetarian option. I'm surprised it isn't more crowded because I can't really thing of a negative thing to say about the place. The salad is yummy, and I'm not even a salad person. I think my favorite dish here thus far has been the Peruvian corn. The atmosphere is cozy with a little shop in the front."
"1.0","Please update your pricing on your display. When I went to check out, the price was more than 50 cents higher than expected because their computer system is current and their board is more than '2 years' out of date. How is this fair or accurate? I did not get a warm response when asking about milk alternatives... it seemed to be a hassle for me to want something that costs .75 cents more. You think they would have been happy to tell me their alternatives.  And there was no discount for bringing my own mug. Overall bad experience unfortunately because I live in the southside and would prefer to support local businesses."
"5.0","I LOVE THIS PLACE! I order from them a lot more than I'd like to admit. Their food is ALWAYS always delicious. They have the best customer service too! Any time there was a problem, or they had a question they immediately called me to clarify. They even called me once for an opinion since I ordered so regularly. I recommend this place to everyone. Even my room mates have jumped on the bandwagon. Definitely check this place out, you will not be disappointed!! (I highly recommend their chicken panini!)"
"4.0","I just had my first Subba experience today as takeout, and I have to say, I'm impressed! Cheap and delicious. I got the Nepali chicken and veggie momo. The nepali dishes come with a gravy-style main (think indian curries), some amazing dal, and some veggies in a dry sauce. All of it was delicious! The guy asked me if I wanted it spicy or medium and I said somewhere in between. Be warned, they are generous on the heat. Maybe not for you if that's not your thing. But I happen to love it, so I was very pleased! The sauce for the momo set my mouth on fire, but it was delicious. The momo had a thick, chewy consistency to the dough, which is something I really love in a dumpling. The filling was moist and beautifully spiced. And I could eat a gallon bucket of that dal. The chicken appeared to be boneless thigh pieces, and the flavor was excellent. It was quite a bit of food and definitely made a pretty big lunch and dinner for me. At $15 for two full meals, I'm very pleased.All in all, this place is great. I can see how the service might be slower sometimes due to a very small staff, but it appears to be a small, family-owned place and everything else about it makes any potential wait worth it. I'd rather have a bit of a wait than see the prices go up if they hired more staff, but I'd love to see an awesome place like this grow and be successful in the area!"
"1.0","I asked for oil and vinegar on a hoagie instead of a packet of crappy Italian dressing - what a shock I got when the owner refused to do it! They sell oil and vinegar in the store! Very hostile and unfriendly owner! I was surprised by this attitude and have never had anything like that happen anywhere, ever in Pittsburgh, where independent store owners all appreciate their customers and bend over backwards to please them - every store in the strip and every other store in Bloomfield. Good luck to this business with an attitude like that!"
"2.0","Can't say I'm terribly impressed by this place, although the umbrellas in the patio are pretty cool. I came here with a group of friends and we were all pretty underwhelmed by both the options on the menu and the quality of the food. Additionally, the prices are pretty unreasonable for the area. One of my friends discovered the cheapest way to get full was to order two bagel sandwiches rather than a bagel combo. I also couldn't wrap my head around the salad dressing they use -- it was way too acidic and really overpowered my meal. I guess the eclectic decor in the patio somewhat reminds me of my time in Paris, but in a cheesy way. Probably worth checking out if you're in the area due to a lack of other hipster brunch places, but I don't see myself returning anytime soon."
"2.0","TL;DR: good food, but can take an *eternity*Reserved through No Wait, est 45-60 min wait. We were seated after 110+ mins. Ordered the second or third time the waiter stopped by after waters + coffee, then waited almost another 50 minutes for our food during a slow time of day.Total time from putting in our name to leaving: 3+ hours."
"5.0","Very nice place, the menu is interesting and the prices are reasonable. I went here for happy hour. For $5.00 you could pick from a list of infusions and they will make a special drink based of your preferences. Our bartender (Alec) was really personable and recommended a couple of drinks based of our likes. The drinks were tasty but not too strong which is appropriate for a happy hour. Food was excellent. I had the 'Turkey' dish which was a piece of whitefish that was cooked to perfection. It wasn't the most interesting thing on the menu but I was on a special diet and needed something light/healthy and it fit the bill. My companion had the pulled pork sandwich which was the best tasting thing I've tried in awhile. The bread they used was phenomenal as was the other toppings and they also had really good, crispy french fries which is very rare.  Prices were spot on to the quality/portion of the food. It got a bit loud after the place started to fill up but seems like that is the norm of these one room establishments and there isn't much that can be done. The crowd was a good mix of younger and middle aged couples."
"5.0","This is one of the best secrets of Pittsburgh. By far the best Pho in the area and over many places I have visited. If you want good service & environment, you'd better stop here. It's a hole in the wall by a seemingly angry asian (he's actually quite nice). Expect to wait on water or wait on refills. If you make your order too complicated, it'll probably get messed up.With that, the Pho. It's amazing and I've had a lot of Pho. However, it has it hit and miss days too. The meatball is more tender and flavorful than the beef which can be dry or tough to some that haven't had Pho before. I wouldn't recommend any other versions. A small is available as most Americans I bring here are unable to finish a bowl.Spring rolls are great (cold/fresh) with a peanut dipping sauce. The egg rolls are just amazingly full of flavor (fried) with a fish style dipping sauce. Place is very inexpensive too. Oh, this place is BYOB in terms of alcohol. Forgot to mention it's cash only. There's an ATM at the entrance or any of the nearby gas stations."
"3.0","What you'd expect out of a bar on Carson. Decent food and a good selection of brews. Service was good."
"2.0","Tried them for the 1st time last night. Got the ultra huge 45 slice cheese pizza. They delivered in a good amount of time. The delivery man didn't give me any change back, he just left assuming I was giving him the whole thing. The pizza had no flavor what so ever! I think if I'm paying $39.99 for a pizza there should be some flavor to at least get my taste buds watering... & at least automatically come with 1 topping! Not sure if I'll give them another try"
"4.0","This was my first time eating at Mezzo or even making it to the second floor of this three story establishment. I have been to Emporio (first floor) and Il Tetto (roof top) multiple times and really enjoy the atmosphere. When you first walk up to the second floor you will notice a wine wall with so much wine!! From the wooden floor, to the wooden dining tables/chairs and the rustic brick walls I felt like I walked into a Tuscan kitchen. For my meal I ordered the Pork Risotto and I do not regret this decision one bit! I really like that you can order a half portion. I always end up taking left overs home and tonight I am proud to say I finished an entire meal. I would absolutely get this again! One thing that bugged my friends and I was when we paid our bill the waitress came to pick her tip up while we were still sitting there talking. There was only one other table in there with us so it's not like we needed to hurry and rush out. Waiters/waitresses should never do that!"
"5.0","Overall masterpiece. Ordered the brandade de bacalao montadito to start, unbelievable in taste and the slight hint of lemon at the end is perfect. The Chorizo was perfect, a counter to the date and 'blue cheese' as well as the serrano ham being a perfect funk balance to the almonds. The octopus was beyond tender with an enough snap to break the texture and finally the 18oz steak was to die for. Lain over a bed of smashed potatoes with caramelized shallot and it was one of the best pieces of meat you could get in the city. Last (and for all) the Crema Calatalana desert was a perfect way to end the night here. Our sever, Clara, really made our experience here beyond amazing. She was friendly, down to earth, and willing to answer any questions that we had, as well as give excellent recommendations. This is a highly sought after gem of Pittsburgh in my book and I recommend it to anyone."
"4.0","tom yum soup = awesome (cures both jetlag & a cold).  good service.  good as takeout.  BYOB."
"3.0","Friendly staff. Couple minor flubs. Decent tasting food, but surely over priced. I get that though- catering to their location. Will check it out again when I make more money."
"5.0","One of the best Italian places in Pittsburgh. Delicious food and lovely service. It's the perfect place for a romantic night out or a family meal."
"5.0","Great place in South Side.  Not being a coffee drinker, it is hard to review a coffee shop, but they have a great tea selection of Harney and Sons teas as well as loose teas.  Love the open storefront windows as well as all of the seating. A great place to meet up with friends or just read a book.  Highly recommended for anyone who doesn't 'need' to go to Starbucks."
"5.0","prince of india never fails me. I literally eat here way to often. I have never had a bad meal here. My favorite is the chicken tikka masala. I have eaten at a lot of indian places in pittsburgh but prince of india is no doubt the best."
"5.0","Location sucks.. it's pretty hidden but the food is top 3 for Chinese restaurants downtown. They're always pleasant when I pick my food up (I go on my lunch breaks) and everything I order is delicious, every time. Giving 5 stars"
"4.0","CMU students have been waiting for this Chipotle to open for a long time now. It has been about a week that it has been open and they've had a very busy week. During lunch and dinner hours, the lines get really long. They have a nice seating area on the second floor. Food is just like any other Chipotle outlet. My favorite is a burrito bowl with chicken."
"2.0","Where do begin? The  only  shining service point of the night was putting our name in for a table. The service only went down from there. My fiancé waited 15 minutes at the bar trying to get order a round of drinks, nothing, Finally our table was ready - a 2-seater for three people.  We took it so we didn't have to wait any longer.... That was a mistake.Our server Braydon was friendly but less than attentive. She  walked by our table numerous times, looked at us, but stopped for drink orders from the tables next to us. When she finally stopped - we only saw her a handful of times.  Our drinks were decent - my friend's drink had an extremely heavy pour.  Our appetizers were good (the nuts!)  but a bit overpriced ($10) for a bowl full of nuts. The water was definitely not cold (or cool). Overall, it was a great atmosphere. I definitely enjoyed the bar's set-up. The people watching is fantastic. I'd try it again in hopes if a better service experience!"
"4.0","Although a little pricey, the food was delicious! The plates to be shared are very generous in size and we definitely over ordered. The Brussel sprouts (something I would normally stay far, far away from) were surprisingly good. The drinks were a little expensive, and a glass of wine was minuscule compared to a standard pour. The cider with pumpkin is definitely worth a try. Great atmosphere, although the music was very loud (and that's coming from someone in their early twenties!!)"
"1.0","Great bar.  Horrible treatment by one of the bartenders.  Rude and disrespectful.  I hope that the owner reads this."
"3.0","Great location! Love biking through here and stopped for drinks a few times. I have to say the service and some of the guests give off snobby vibes. Good wine list, have not tried the food. Live entertainment a plus. Feels like your on a beach vacation when you're here!"
"3.0","If there was a button that said 'not for vegetarians', I'd click it.That aside, my carnivorous friends really like the comfort food this place serves up, and the bar staff is quick and friendly for their happy hour.  A large chunk of the crowd in the afternoon and early evening are lawyers, as this is where they head after work in the nearby buildings."
"4.0","i'm a fan. everything is made to order so i call ahead. i get breakfast but the greek salad gets good reviews from people."
"3.0","I had recently gone to the Indian buffet at Indian Spices, two doors down, so I wanted to compare.  I would say that in a dead heat, Indian Spices would take the win.  They are the same price, India Palace definitely has a nicer decor - it's larger and more spacious, but the food has a bit more spice at Indian Spices. India Palace has a 8.99 lunch buffet.  Standard fare with dessert, but all the food was lacking a bit in heat which was disappointing.  Also, there weren't enough vegetables.  I feel like everything was chicken which was not what everyone is looking for.  The hostess was quick with silverware and waters though.  It looks like you could also get tea and some other drinks as well."
"5.0","You can't go wrong with the mac and cheese sandwich!  I loved the sides that came with it too, the best tomato soup I ever had!"
"4.0","Very cool atmosphere, rustic and homey. Larger than I expected on the inside with a side room that has a large couch and tables to work at. Tea is delicious and the staff are friendly."
"4.0","Alexander's is good, solid Italian food without any pretentiousness. Their menu is large, but not outrageously expansive like a lot of other local Italian restaurants in the area. There's a nice selection of Italian favorites, plus you have the ability to create your own past dish (choose your pasta, type of sauce, and add-ons).I've been to Alexander's several times for lunch and always enjoyed it, so I decided to take my girlfriend there for dinner on a recent night. When we entered, we were warmly greeted by the staff and asked where we wanted to sit. We sat in the front of the house/bar area so I could keep an eye on the Pirates game. While there, I overheard an older lady complaining that her dish was less than stellar. The server and the manager agreed with her assessment and offered to make her anything else on the menu to make her happy. I've always been pleased by the pleasant, accommodating nature of the staff when I've visited Alexander's; it's truly a strong point of the restaurant.I ordered the pork osso bucco with garlic risotto, while my girlfriend went with chicken parmigiano. We opened with bruschetta toast. It was a nice start. The tomatoes were fresh, and the taste of balsamic vinegar gave it a little pop of flavor. I then had their wedding soup, which is always enjoyable. It's full of meat and has just the right level of saltiness to it. My girlfriend was pleased with her garden salad; in particular, she enjoyed the flavor and texture added by walnuts and cranberries.The pork osso bucco I received was huge. Unfortunately, the flavor was not as big as the size of the dish. The pork was tender and properly cooked... the garlic risotto, not so much. It was just kind of bland. Together, the dish was fairly tasty, but not something that I would order again. My girlfriend was pleased with her massive serving of chicken parmigiano and pasta. It was good, but the breading was a little soggy because it was doused in sauce.Somewhere during the course of our dinner, the manager walked from table to table, and asked every group if they wanted a loaf of Italian bread. I suppose that they had a lot of extra bread and were giving it out since the night was winding down. I heartily accepted- their bread is delicious. Little things like this are why I love Alexander's.If you're looking for some tasty Italian food served in a friendly, welcoming atmosphere, you can't go wrong with Alexander's. Just stick with the pasta, and you'll be happy."

"5.0","This place is so great! I love the bowl options. It's great to have a quick meal that is actually healthy. I also love the design of the store itself. I was happy to Instagram there...and yes, that's actually important to me! Also, I got to chat with one of the owners and that was really cool! They are very into providing good service and great food!"
"5.0","Excellent staff! Incredible food.  I really enjoyed the family style serving.  Chicken parmagiana was huge and flavorful.  I highly recommend visiting this establishment."
"2.0","This was my first visit to Redfin Blues, and I was underwhelmed.  While our server was quite nice, she wasn't very attentive, long waits for everything were the norm - drinks, water, finally placing our order, getting the appetizer, and eventually getting our entrees.  We ordered the Chips & Dips to start, which included a large plate of tortilla chips and two immensely small servings of dips (you had your choice of dips, we had the artichoke dip and the pineapple salsa).  The dips were tasty, but there was only enough for about 1/3 of the chips.  That was grossly overpriced at $10, which would have been reasonable if there was more dip.I ordered the fish tacos.  There were three small tacos, loaded with lettuce and topped with very small strips of fish, no side dish, all for $16.  It was worth about $6.  I won't speak for my friends, except to say that no one raved about their food.The river view from the deck was nice, but the smokers were not.While I would give Redfin Blues one more try in the event that this was an off night, I doubt it will be any time soon."
"5.0","Another amazing dinner experience with my husband. I don't think the food could get any better. Drinks are great too!Do the YUM YUM sushiCrab stuffed salmonAnd key lime pie..and you will leave happy!"
"4.0","Dinner date with my sister on a Wednesday night. Almost every table was filled, I recommend reservations! We started with decaf coffee (thrilling, I know) Our waiter brought out a french press pitcher! He left it on the table for us to refill our cups when needed and it was delicious! I've never seen coffee served at a restaurant like that so I was impressed. My sister had been to Stagioni's before and insisted on the MTO Mozzarella appetizer. My sister knows good cheese, trust me. It's a good portion of her personal food pyramid. I am not a huuuuge cheese fan but I trusted her opinion and we got the mozz. The dish was served with prosciutto, roasted red peppers and olives. The cheese had course seal salt on top and the whole dish was sprinkled with a balsamic glaze. Well, my sister was stop on. The cheese was incredibly fresh and it had a deep flavor profile, which I find rare with mozzarella cheese. The glaze and additions to the plate complimented the cheese without overpowering the taste. I would get this again...and again...I plan to go back just to order this the next time I'm visiting Pittsburgh!Since the mozz app is large, we opted to share two small dishes- polenta with shrimp & salsa verde and a side of fingerling potatoes. Both dishes were delicious but the servicing style of the polenta was my favorite part. The shrimp and salsa verde is brought out on a small cutting board. The polenta is brought out separate from a small cooking pot and poured directly onto the cutting board, Unique and fresh! Excellent taste. The shrimp were lightly seasoned and the polenta was moist (I apologize if you hate that word, it's the only way to describe it!) The fingerling potatoes were roasted and served with a sundried tomato paste. Mhm Mhm Mhm! Excellent pair. For dessert, we opted to share the Nutella Mousse. I know what you're thinking, 'Nutella mousse- have my dreams come true??' My sister and I certainly thought that and we were disappointed to receive pudding inside of a wine glass with whip cream and roasted hazelnuts on top. The hazelnuts had good flavor but the pudding only had a hint of Nutella flavor *cue the tears* We didn't finish the pudding and know better than to order it again. Dessert is my least favorite part of a meal so I didn't let the lackluster mousse knock down their rating.  Service was fast, friendly & professional. Ambiance is quiet and romantic but still a good place to go with friends! I will be back for the app and to try a few other entrees!"
"1.0","I love pho and it's always my hangover meal. my first time here. I ordered fresh spring rolls and pho combination with meat outside. The fresh spring rolls were brough out within a minute so it seemed more like it was premade. Pho comb didn't have the usual beef  ingredients and the slices of beef weren't too fresh, because the color was brownish instead of pink. The noodles were very chopped up as well. I understand every restaurant has their own style but this is definitely not my favorite. The check was place to my table when I was still eating, and it was CASH ONLY. An ATM was right outside and of course I have to pay charge fee to take out cash. The most unacceptable thing is that they charge extra for having the meat outside, like who does it?!!? Just like McDonald charges extra for buying 2 burgers and pack it in 2 separate bags. WOW!! Unbelievable! Personally I won't go there ever again. I think I still like the Vietnamese place on strip district better."
"1.0","Great food but it took 40 minutes for a bartender to get our food order. That's not right."
"5.0","First of all, the staff at Caffe Mona are so lovely and personable!  They are so accommodating and friendly!The food was absolutely fantastic - there is a great variety to order from! I decided on the Elvis, a sweet crepe with my favorite food groups: peanut butter and bacon!!!   Most importantly, the coffee is so flavorful, I didn't even need cream or sugar! Coffee is a necessity in my life, and it definitely complimented my sweet meal.The outside deck pays a sweet homage to the 'umbrellas' of the three rivers arts festival by their own exhibit of multi-colored hanging umbrellas. It was perfect for the sunny day- just enough colorful coverage!Caffe Mona does not disappoint- I can't wait to return soon!  Next time I hope to try a savory crepe - the buffalo chicken crepe looked delicious."
"2.0","Ugh pretty horrible. The food was standard if not below typical Domino's quality but the service and cleanliness could use a definite upgrade. Maybe we were a little drunk and annoying, but everyone employed there was, like, dead in the eyes. I couldn't wait to get out of there."
"5.0","Great little place! First time here, but went with friends who have been before. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Each of the bagel meals comes with a side salad which has a delicious balsamic vinaigrette dressing. All the food was wonderful! Would recommend this place to anyone."
"4.0","Delicious beautifully displayed matcha cheesecake a bit small for $12. Feels like you walk up 2 flights right into Japan. Will have to return for the food."
"4.0","The sandwiches here are awesome, just like being home in New York.  I got the Prociutto sandwich with fresh mozzarella and it was to die for... The soft, fresh roll really made it all work together... Simply delicious!  Highly recommend, as the lines outside would indicate!"
"5.0","I really enjoyed our experience. We came in around 10, happy hour was just beginning. There was a nightly punch on the happy hour. I inquired about the punch and they had not prepared it yet. The barista crafted the nightly punch based off my personal taste. Asking me what flavors I prefer, alcohol preference, it was really so fun. Once he had crafted the punch to suit my taste buds he came to the table and gave a short presentation. The drink was brillant. I ordered the wings, they were garlic flavored cheese perfection. I loved the ambiance of this spot too. Amazing food, drinks and truly exceptional service."
"2.0","Suffice it to say, this is not real Italian food and it's below average and overpriced when it comes to American-Italian food. The staff was excellent though and you will have great service and conversation. Thanks but probably won't be back."
"4.0","The mushroom bruschetta and vegan chili was very very tasty.  The soup tasted so fresh and had the perfect seasoning.  The mushroom bruschetta was almost 5 stars.  But the bread was burnt on the one side which made it really tough to eat.  But the flavors of the mushrooms with the onions and balsamic had a great flavor and consistency of the ingredients.  I wasn't expecting such a tasty meal while going to look at plants lol."
"1.0","I am only giving this place a star because the manager is very nice. Otherwise, it wouldn't have any.  Where do I begin with the issues I've had with this place in the 6 months I've lived here. I don't want to make this too long so I'll sum it up. One night I ordered a sandwich, a free sandwich, because they added mushrooms, which I'm allergic to and explicitly stated in a previous order.. they added mushrooms yet again. Livid is not a strong enough word for me. The manager offered to replace it, fully remake it and have it redelivered. It already took an hour to get there in the first place so I offered to go ahead and drive down. I get there and there was a fight happening between the workers. I just wanted the damn sandwich so I stood at the counter. As I looked around there was blood drops everywhere...counter, floor... table flipped over it was disgusting and a very horrible way for a RESTAURANT to look. I reached out to Domino's corporate that night stating what I experienced and they said they can't do anything because it's franchised, reach out to the physical store. It turns out it was the manager fighting an employee so why bring up an incident he was apart of? This disgusting debacle was the hugest thing that's occurred. Other than that, you always wait close to two hours for delivery. Something is ALWAYS  wrong with your order."
"2.0","Wow, what happened? When I worked in town I would go every Thursday for a fish sandwich. Loved the place! Although the food was good but not sure what happened to the old staff. I was there for lunch & there were at least five female servers who were serving about four tables. They were bickering loudly over everything, couldn't get their orders straight. This was making me uncomfortable so when my food arrived, I gulped it down & got the hell out of there before a fight broke out among the staff. So much for tradition! Now it looks like auditions for a roller blade competition. Won't be going back. Such a huge disappointment."
"5.0","I love ordering pizza from here! My boyfriend and I are regulars.i always get my plain cheese pizza from here. I am a simple person and only eat plain cheese, so nothing extravagant or difficult to master. But it's so good! My boyfriend gets the buffalo chicken pizza and he has always been a fan. Delivery is almost always under their 45 min wait time and the delivery persons are very kind. I love ordering from here"
"1.0","Waited 20 minutes for to go hoagies. There was no meat all bread. Would have been good if they actually put steak on our cheesesteak. What a rip!!!"
"3.0","My parents were in town and since my Mom's birthday is next week we decided to go out for an early celebration.  I now live in Bloomfield so we decided to go Italian.  Full disclosure:  my first choice was D'Amico's but either they changed their storefront and I didn't recognize it, or they have closed.  In any event, my plan B was Alexanders.We went on a Tuesday night around 7.  Parking was no problem, free street parking after 6-nice!  The bar was deserted and the small dining room had two or three small groups.  So no shouting to make yourself heard-double nice!  The seating was comfortable (we got a square table in the middle of the room).Our server was very nice and efficient and I'd give her at least 4 stars.  My mom got the spinach and cheese ravioli w/ marinara sauce (on the menu the ravioli are deep fried but they honored her request for a 'normal' cook), my dad got angel hair with bolognese sauce, and I got linguini with pesto sauce.I was surprised that the pasta dishes did not come with a salad so if you go, that's additional.  The server said that the serving sizes were generous.  They were good portions but not huge by Pittsburgh standards.  My mom does not have a large appetite and she ate all but one ravioli.  I ate all my pasta and could have had more.  My Dad was reaching for his third slice of bread after he polished off his pasta, so I'll let you draw your own conclusions!  :)  The sauces were good and the pasta tasted like it was fresh.  Everything was warm/lukewarm, but not steaming hot.  I'm a bit of a slow eater, especially with pasta so by the time I was finishing, it was cold.The food was OK, in cases like this, I really wish you could give a half star, because this is 3.5 stars.  Nothing was horrible, nothing was excellent.  It was good.  The bill with a tip was around $55 (we all had soft drinks), which again I don't have a major quibble about.Not sure I will go back, but not sorry I went.  :)"
"4.0","They recently introduced several flavors of bingsoo, the Korean frozen dessert, probably for the summer but hopefully to stay for longer. Given that it is virtually nonexistent in Pgh AFAIK (save for Sumi's in Squirrel Hill), this is a nice option to have. Flavors range from matcha to mango to popping boba, and it's $6 for a medium-sized (but heavy!) cup. While I've always had it in a bowl in other cities, I guess a cup makes sense for takeout.I tried the matcha, and I guess the only reason it was called that was because of the matcha ice cream on top. Below that was a variety of different sweet fillings and bites, with textures all over the place. Mochi, jellies, red bean, almonds, even a couple of pocky sticks. While bingsoo usually contains many of these ingredients, this is all really jam-packed, and much of the shaved ice had already been compressed into a blob by the time I got to it. So I would go as far as to compare it to a halo-halo (without the ube), rather than a traditional bingsoo.  It was also a bit sweet for me, but it's a fun item to get if you're feeling decadent once in a while."
"5.0","Been here several times now and I love it. It's right along the river and gives you a summer vibe. Be prepared on the weekends on a nice summer day to wait a long time, would definitely recommend getting in line on yelp before driving there. I always get the salmon sandwich and the dip that comes with it is delicious. Not sure why it has received bad reviews, in my eyes it's one of the best places along the river."
"4.0","Always can expect the same thing. It is nice being consistent. A little known fact about this place is that their burgers are excellent! I also love the pretzels. Ask for a side of golden garlic sauce to dip them in. Only way I will eat them!"
"4.0","Can't go wrong with a Big Salad.  A division of the Eat N Park corporation, Hello Bistro has pretty much any traditional Salad topping you could ask for.  Choose your type of lettuce, add your toppings, pick a protein, tell them how you want it chopped up and what dressing you want and its done.  Be wary of the lunch crowd at this downtown location, as the line and wait time can get pretty long.I usually go with mixed lettuce with Angry Shrimp and the Thai Peanut sauce.  Usually stick to the usual topping like strawberries, onions, banana peppers, ham cubes, chickpeas and mozzarella balls, but have been known to throw a curveball in there every now and again.A good, filling salad that is better for you then most of the other quick lunch options downtown.  Also helps that my office is 4 blocks away, so a little walk makes me feel better about myself on top of eating a healthier salad.BTW, they do have sandwiches and even the Super Burger available, but you can go to a regular Eat N Park or anywhere else for that.  You end up at Hello Bistro, go with the salad.  That's kinda what they are good at doing."
"5.0","It's my favorite place in Craig. The authentic Chinese menus are actually not that bad. I always go here every week."
"2.0","I was not impressed with the food.  My girlfriend said the quiche was great (5/5) and the potatoes were horrible (0/5).  I ordered two scrambled eggs (5/5), sausage (2/5), wheat toast and their potatoes (0/5).  First I must say kudos to the sous-chef since I believe she made the eggs.  They were cooked *perfectly* without any scorching.  The sausage was in a flattened patty that was overcooked and hard to cut with a fork.  It was pretty nasty and I will not order it again.  The potatoes were even worse; flavorless and dried out.  I believe they make them by the pan and keep them in an oven, sometimes mixing the old pan with the new.  I say this because some were cooked correctly and others were shriveled, black and all moisture was burnt out of them.  Chef Raymond or Management needs to investigate the potato situation because they were a 0/5 in my rating system as well.Our total bill with drinks was around $25.  $25 for two breakfasts should be astounding food in my opinion.  It was not."
"5.0","Since I've lived in Pittsburgh, I've been here around 15 times at the food NEVER falls short.  The other reviews are spot on.  This is the best steak you will get in the city.  There are some shortfalls that only move the rating down to probably a 4.6.  The atmosphere is a little stuffy.  It's good for business but maybe not for pleasure as much.  The lighting is too bright.  For that reason, it loses some of the romance in my eyes. But all it all this place is SOLID.  Everything on that menu is 5 stars.  (Believe me, I've tried them all)"
"5.0","I was here just recently for a wedding engagement party and the food was exceptional my steak was done just the way i ordered it. The wine was pretty good and i am not a wine drinker and actually liked the red they served. I would say i would come again."
"3.0","I went there recently with my family, and the food was good overall, but the service was rude.  Upon arriving there, we asked if there was a place to hang our coats, and were told it's 'a little hard to get to'; and that was it, so we crammed them into our booth.  Corkage fee was charged for the wine we brought (since the wine list is practically nonexistent), which we completely expected and appreciated that we could bring our own wine; but our waiter took the cork out of the bottle and set it down on the table and walked away. WOW.  For $10 per bottle, maybe he could have actually poured it into our glasses?  The restaurant ran out of bread that night, we were told.  The salad came with the dressing in disposable plastic cups on the side. Really?   I think Eat N Park has a better dinner salad than this!  Most Italian bistros ask if you'd like ground pepper on the salad, but this wasn't an option, so it was pepper from the shaker on the table.   We had one dessert for a birthday in our group, but our waiter never asked anyone else at the table if they wanted to order dessert or coffee.  Since the appetizers and entrees were good, I may give 'em another chance, maybe for lunch, but I am truly blown away that Alexander's was Post-Gazette's Reader's Choice Award winner for Best Italian in 2008, which is very proudly displayed in several places."
"4.0","Cinderlands is a newer brewpub in Lawrenceville with a modern vibe, unique food, and good beer.  If you're looking for somewhere to get a cheap Yuengling and a basket of wings, this may not be your place, but if you are looking to try some interesting food combinations and sample some local beers, this is the place to go.  The menu is a bit limited and pricey, but all of the options appeal to an adventurous eater.  Our waitress was friendly and helpful and made sure our meals were made to order with any specifications that we made.  We did notice a disclaimer on the menu that all fried menu items are fried in peanut oil, so be careful if anyone in your group has a peanut allergy. Overall - interesting food and good beer in a clean and cute establishment"
"5.0","I've been putting off writing this review because I have way too many good things to type up. But I'll keep it to a minimum and include the highlights.  Let's start with the staff and atmosphere. I love the vibe of the restaurant and the cozy lighting. It is a perfect spot for a date or to have a homemade Italian dish with friends.  The staff...beyond AMAZING. I've been there about four times and they recognize me are always quick to say hi.  It doesn't stop with just hi, they come up and carry conversation and that's when I usually ask them for dish recommendations.  Julie is my go to girl for that, she is always making food suggestions and never fails me.  Brian the bartender is also always super attentive, taking his time crafting the perfect drink.  The other two men who are waiters are nothing short of awesome as well.  The staff is always making dinner an enjoyable experience by being super attentive, making great suggestions, and keeping us laughing. Now. The DELICIOUS food. I am very very skeptical of Italian food.  I have yet to come across a good Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh, until now.  I come from a huge Italian family so all I've grown up with is homemade Italian food.  Gnocchi is my favorite thing my grandma made, but I never order it from restaurants because they all fall short of my expectations.  The gnocchi is stellar.  It's flavorful with perfect texture..just like my grandmas!  The mozzarella ball as an appetizer...a cheese lovers dream, it is so fresh and delicious. I've had the polenta as well, which was phenomenal.  Last time I tried the stuffed hot peppers which were also so delicious.  The bread served before your meal is also warm, soft, and everything I could ever hope for lol.  Basically I've never had anything I did t like.  Oh! And I forgot to mention dessert. I managed to squeeze it in after almost bursting at the seems from my dinner (don't judge), but I ordered the Nutella hazelnut mousse...sooooo tasty. The best part...the prices.  This place gives you giant servings (I even order the half portions) for a great price.  So last time I was there, we ordered four entrees, a bottle of wine, an appetizer, and dessert..for $100!!! That is unheard of. You really get your bang for your buck here. Man I can't wait until my next visit!"
"4.0","The Yard is pretty good, I think one of the better places on the Walnut Street stretch in Shadyside. Our service was pretty great. They seemed to have a lot of specials, we hit the tail end of happy hour. We got a holiday old fashioned for $5 which was very good. I got The Yard Burger, it was cooked perfectly and had a lot of great flavors. The fries were just okay. Next time I go I'll have to try one of the grilled cheeses, apparently that's their specialty. Overall, a solid spot."
"2.0","This was our first time eating at Pasha. We wanted to order take out. It was almost impossible to find a menu online! I called to place our order and had a few questions regarding the food and it seemed there was a disconnect about the order we had placed. I asked her to read back our order and everything was just as we wanted (nothing was a special request). We ordered the appetizer sampler with cold dips. We were told to pick 5. The sampler was a little on the pricier side but we were looking forward to trying new things. They told us our order would be ready in 15min. We arrived 15 min later and had to wait 15 additional minutes(not the end of the world). We got our order and I was very disappointed. There were only 4 dips in the sampler (we paid for 5) and TWO out of the four they gave us we did not order. Neither of us like mushrooms or grape leaves and that's what they gave us. I also ordered falafel for my meal it was also pricey and a very small portion on a small bed of lettuce with a little hummus for dipping. If we had checked at the restaurant or closer to when we went home we would have told them our order was unsatisfactory. It was too late when we opened our take out at home. We will most likely not be back."
"5.0","I've followed Edgar wherever he has a restaurant a small stand and now this place. Super tasty, lots of great salsas, fyi you can buy them by the pint to take home the Chipotle being my favorite.Whenever visiting the strip I pip n for a couple days f tacos. Reasonably priced at 2 for $5 , in fact had some for breakfast when biking through the strip today. Deliciosos!"
"4.0","This is located in a great part of Pittsburgh near the universities and my favorite suburb, Shadyside. Fresh, hot, authentic Indian food and a clean, welcoming atmosphere. Servers are quick and on their toes filling up your water glasses, which you will need to wash down the few pounds of fresh food you consume from their buffet. However, a few things that were missing (may have been the day) was paneer and some sweet treats at the end of the buffet. Other than that- great bang for your buck!"
"2.0","A very inviting space, Luke's was disappointing to me on food.  I ordered the seared ahi tuna appetizer, props to this being mostly discounted due to the yelp checkin but the tuna was overcooked and personally I think the dish would be much better leaving the tuna raw because the flavor of the slaw and sauce was a good compliment.My crab cake sandwich was small and I was disappointed that they would not broil the crab cake but the waiter assured me that it was only quickly flash fried. We might have differing definitions of flash fried because there was a thick layer of fried crust which deterred what would have otherwise been a good sammy. The fries were excellent - well seasoned and perfectly cooked.  The bloody marys (although I didn't order one) had epicly sized accoutrements."
"5.0","My five star coffee shop. I've been working from home the past two months and this is by far my favorite place to work. When you work from home in Pittsburgh in January/February it's really cold out! I've tried several coffee shops and always find myself freezing. My favorite place to sit is in the lofts it's always warm and toasty and has a great view of all the art work you'll find. I love when I find a great spot with excellent staff. Can you ask for anything better? You'll notice they call multiple people by their first name and know orders by heart. They're happy to make recommendations and will go out of their way to make sure your order is just what you wanted. They menu is robust. I'm talking coffees, teas, juices, smoothies, breakfast sandwiches and grilled cheese. You can stay all day... speaking of all day they're open until 8:00pm. If you have a lot to accomplish, this is the place to do it."
"3.0","We've gone to Jerome Bettis Grille a bunch of times. We love sitting outside. The location is perfect. The food is however just so so, and the service is really slow. That's sad. Hope they can heed all of these reviews and improve, cuz they would totally rock it."
"4.0","Las Velas is my FAVORITE Mexican place in Pittsburgh. The quality of their food is delicious! Make sure you try their chips and salsa. It's a little pricey comparatively which is usually fine by me since the the quality is always wonderful. However, their service, while friendly, is often very slow regardless of time of day. Make sure you have at least an hour even if you're just getting drinks."
"5.0","Fresh and tasty food! Best I've found since moving from NYC. Highly recommend the chicken noodle soup and the seaweed chili app!"
"4.0","The best Indian food that I've had in Pittsburgh hitherto. I ordered one of specials of the day - goat briyani. The goat was very soft and tender. The dish itself was pleasantly spiced and herbed (I cannot neglect the fresh cilantro), and it came with a light yogurt-type sauce. It was a large portion too. The only drawback is the price. My entree plus tip costed $20. I'd be interested in returning for the lunch buffet which costs half the price, or I might return for student night (on wednesday) when the second entree is half off."
"3.0","This is one of those reviews that I really wish I could give 3.5 stars. Ki Ramen has great potential, but it just doesn't quite hit the right flavor notes to make this a 4+ star experience. I really enjoyed the ambiance, the service was great, and my cocktail was delicious, but the food is just average. We started with the fried Cauliflower which was texturally perfect, but there was nothing flavor wise that really made it pop. This was also the theme with the ramen that we had, chicken and inferno, it was all there except for the flavor to really set the dish apart, there just aren't enough layers to really get you excited for that next bite. I will most likely come here again, but I don't see this establishment as anything more than a great place to meet with some friends for a cocktail. Hopefully I'm wrong, but from my experience I can name a dozen or so better places to grab a bite in Lawrenceville."
"5.0","The best Asian food I found around Oakland, the foods are decent, and the price is reasonable. It's a place you could spend around $10 to $30, and get a food like it's $50. If you like Asian food, this is definitely the place to go."
"4.0","Thank you, sir, may I have another?   I could have said that about anything I ate here.While perusing Yelp for a place to eat while visiting Pittsburgh, I was impressed with the reviews and the photos so we decided to have dinner here on a Saturday night.  The bar area is beautiful...I loved the giant mirror backed bar and it immediately have a warm, friendly and cool vibe.In the dining area, there was some really cool lighting (which oddly brightened and dimmed so many times I thought I might be having a stroke) as well as a terrific brick wall that gave some texture and depth to the room without making it too noisy.We started with cocktails (old fashioned) which were good.   Then for starters, we had the roasted carrot salad and some kind of cold green soup.   The carrot salad was great and I'm still not sure about the soup.  The flavor was unique and it had a variety of textures in it...I'm just not sure if I liked it.For the entree, I had hangar steak over roasted cauliflower and it was delicious.  Honestly, I could have just had the roasted cauliflower it was so good, but the steak was a tender and tasty complement.  My better half had carrot bolognese pasta which was also wonderful.To finish, we shared a popcorn panna cotta and a lavender pound cake.  The combination of the caramelized popcorn with the creamy texture of the panna cotta was a match made in heaven.   And that lavender pound cake was something straight off 'The Great British Bake Off'.  Wow, was it good.Service was professional and on point.   This is one of those restaurants I'd love to pick up and move to my neighborhood in NYC so I could eat there all the time."
"3.0","I came here for restaurant week with my boyfriend and for that, it was worth it compared to the normal price of the menu. However, overall there was nothing too outstanding about the place and the menu is very overpriced. He got the clam chowder, salmon, accompaniments (green beans and mashed potatoes) and seasonal berries cheesecake dessert off the restaurant menu ($35.18). I got the lobster Mac and cheese ($18) from the regular menu. Portion sizes were decent. We didn't finish the accompaniments and I had to force myself to finish the Mac and cheese. It had a nice crunch from the topping but it seemed to overwhelm the lobster. There was a decent balance between the textures but I wasn't dying to finish it. The chowder was pretty thick while the Mac and cheese was runny. The salmon was nice and tender, my personal favorite from the meal. The green beans and potatoes were pretty bland; I had to add salt to give them flavor. Also adding the green beans to the Mac and cheese helped to counteract the flavor.The service was pretty good. It was our anniversary so they added a complimentary dessert. The waiter came by to check on us a few times and seemed cordial enough. We made a reservation and were seated pretty quickly after arrival. Conclusively I would not come here again, the food was nothing special. I have seen this chain before as well. But it was a nice experience."
"5.0","Oh....my.....god....dude, this place is insanely great! The food is sooooooooooooooooo good! And the gin and tonics are also delicious. I love small plates/tapas/sharing type places and this one is one of the best ones I've been too. I highly recommend but if you're wanting to eat here on a weekend night, make your reservation early so you can get a good time. Enjoy!!!!"
"5.0","Had 3 small plates, and 3 cocktails. The plates we got were recommended by the amazing bartender. Mofongo, Wings, and Buns. Wow is all i can say. The wings are unlike any others I have ever tried, fall off the bone and so flavorful! The Mofongo, well, probably the most flavorful chicken ever! The bbq on the buns was spicy yet sweet. So, so, so good! The drinks were perfectly mixed. The bartender was very pleasant, knowledgeable and social. I cannot wait to eat (and drink) my way through the menu there!"
"4.0","Damn, dem some tasty tacos. Sometimes I live on the edge and have taco Tuesday on Wednesday. Today was one of those days. They make something funky tasting tacos. And they're nice enough to include slices of lime you could squeeze on to further enhance the flavor."
"5.0","Stagioni is my favorite Italian in Pittsburgh!! It's brings such a homie feeling to Southside and never disappoints. Every time we go we have to order the made to order mozzarella and octopus polenta, SO GOOD! I love their pastas too, they make them in half orders which is great if you want one as a side or if you're like me and can't pick between two and order both. They also have a really good wine list and the fresh bread they bring to the table is indescribable! They do get super busy so make sure you call ahead!"
"3.0","I went in for a rice bowl but apparently they ran out of rice. They asked me to get rice bowl with wild rice and I agreed to it. The bowl seemed to cost 11 bucks but Just had rice, chicken, Guacamole and salsa. I felt that the bowl was a little overpriced for very little ingredients. The staff are very friendly though.Not satisfied with my bowl and that's why the 3 stars!"
"5.0","Wow! What an awesome find this place was! I wasn't feeling the best, and I'm quite sad that I didn't get to fully experience the summit in all its glory. I can't wait to go back and devour their food and cocktail menu.I would have never expected to find such a trendy spot in the rough-and-tough bar section in Mt. Washington. My friend and I were (rather foolishly) walking around Wednesday night hoping to grab a couple drinks. I don't typically come up here because the bar scene is just not what I'm looking for. After walking up and back Shiloh for a minute, we decided to walk into the Summit because it didn't look intimidating and it was very crowded. That had to be a good sign!The bar is gorgeous and inviting, with oak accenting throughout. The bar is set to the left and takes up a large portion of the place, but that's okay because the bar is where you want to be here. We found two seats on the end and ordered pretty basic drinks. She had a Tito's cranberry and I had a rum and sprite.I'm always weary of order specialty cocktails because I either fall in love or I'm so disgusted that I swear off alcohol for a month (hello, Roanoke in Chicago!). Everyone around us seemed to have splurged on a menu item, so next time I come in I'll certainly try it out. We didn't eat much because again, I was not feeling well. The hangover stayed way more past its not-welcomed welcome, and the old adage that you can fix a hangover with more alcohol was not working for me. We had some fries, which were super crispy and seasoned well. I couldn't hang out much longer, which saddened me to the max because I quickly fell in love with the ambiance. They were also playing music trivia. I love trivia!I can't wait to come back to Pittsburgh next so I can come back and bask in all of the Summit's glory!"
"5.0","Cafe Raymond is my 'go to' breakfast spot. I know I can depend on them for great food and good service.The omelettes are excellent, so are their pan fried potatoes. I like ordering at the cashier station, and then finding a table, the food seems to arrive faster that way. This is a great spot to breakfast with friends."
"5.0","Very authentic!  This place came recommended as we traveled to Pittsburgh and were a little worried when we first arrived in the South Side as to what we were going to get.  Our expectations were exceeded.  The mozzarella and prosciutto is must.  The dates were top notch.  Ricotta gnocchi and Pappardelle were both delicious.  Half portions were a great option to leave room for desert.  Any one of them would do but I went with the deconstructed cannoli with pistachio.  Very good.  My only complaint would be to pass on the espresso.  Not very strong but outside that, service was great, atmosphere was cozy, and will return to try other items on the menu if ever in town again."
"3.0","Way overpriced!!!  $10 for a field greens salad and it sure wasn't field greens. !!!  It's so dark in the restraunt that we had to use the light from our cell phones to read the menu!   but the kicker was that they asked what we were celebrating and it was for birthday and anniversary...  They bring out 2 dessert plates one for each - but only one was complimentary... Which is fine... But they should've asked if we wanted 2 and that only one was free. Probably won't be back"
"5.0","I went to Benny Fierro's after getting into a friendly disagreement with one of my pals regarding where you can get The Best Pizza in Pittsburgh (TM). He insisted that Benny's was number one, so I decided I had to check it out. The location is super convenient. Right on Carson street. Perfect for fueling up before a show at The Rex or sobering up after bar hopping.You can buy pizza by the slice, but saying that doesn't accurately describe what you receive. It's a GIANT slice of pizza. Takes up 2 plates. Easily the equivalent of 2-3 normal pieces of pizza, which for $3.50 for cheese and $4.50 for pepperoni is pretty good. The pizza is very good. The crust is super thin. Like super super thin. It can make it a challenge to pick up such a giant piece of pizza weighed down with so much cheese, but overall I don't really have complaints about it. I've heard from some friends from New York that Pittsburgh's pizza is good, but the crust is too thick and chewy (or 'rubbery'). You don't need to worry about that at Benny's, for sure. The best part of this pizza is the cheese -- it's what really gives the slice a punch of flavor that you don't get at a lot of other pizza places.My friend was right in that Benny's is amazing pizza. Hands down best in the South Side. I'd put it at number 3 on my list of favorite pizza places in the 'Burgh overall, but considering there's some stiff competition, that's really good. Highly recommend."
"3.0","Bobby and I stopped in yesterday. I read online that they had good happy hour specials and we havent stopped in for awhile (New Years 2013 was our last visit I believe..)So for happy hour, the appetizers are half off (besides chips, salsa and queso) The maragaritas are $2 off- both small and tall. A small is normally $6 and a tall is normally S10. I believe the same price goes for the sangria which is also $2 off for happy hour. They also had happy hour specials on some beer but i cannot remember the beer or the price.Bobby ordered the margarita and I ordered sangria. I loved my drink and Bobby had no complaints about his. The drinks were strong and we felt a little buzz off of one so I bet after two we would've been *turned up* :p .... We had somewhere to be and could not be on that level though, lol.We also ordered chips and queso. I'm really picky about queso (Moe's=ewwww) I really liked Las Velas' queso however. We finished it with some chips to spare so we ordered salsa. It was good.. not chunky though :(  I love me some chunky salsa haha."

"1.0","Over priced under served average food. Do not eat here. I feel like asking for my tip back. Do not expect a refill on coffee."
"4.0","We dined here on a Saturday night - restaurant was far more casual than we thought it would be. Very dark inside but it's all part of the ambience. Our waitress was friendly and genuine throughout. She spoke slowly and surely, and was very knowledgeable about portion sizes. My husband isn't a pork eater, so we opted to have two snack menu items and two large plates. We ordered the warm bread, sourdough with anchovy and tomato conserve, laurel hill trout, and the chicken arroz. The half a baguette (which we were told is from Five Points - our favorite bakery) was heated up to perfection and served with a delicious her infused olive oil. The sourdough was not impressive. Overly crispy (read: hard) particularly the crust, lacking flavor in general. We were told by the waitresses that the overly crisp edges were authentic, so we took her word for it. The two large plates were perfectly done and highly recommended. The trout was served while, but deboned and cooked to perfection. The chicken with rice was served paella style and had lovely crispy bits to scrape up. The chicken was cooked so perfectly, it has a duck like flavor and texture. We did not order any alcohol or desserts, so we cannot comment on those. Our bill came up to $140 for two with a tip. We would definitely go back for the large plates, but may pass on the other snack/small plates."
"5.0","I guess I'm well overdue to update my review for this place, especially based on how frequently I am checking in on Yelp.  This is, hands down, my favorite bar in the city of Pittsburgh.  Over time, it's become my 'Cheers,' where everybody knows my name... hopefully for nothing but good reasons.The bartenders here are quite possibly the most knowledgeable in the city, and their rotating cocktail menu is a testament to that.  Sure you can get a boring old Tito's and soda (guilty), but you can also have your tastebuds rocked off by a cocktail that you can't quite get anywhere else.  The food is still excellent and this menu also changes seasonally.  Most of the favorites I mentioned in my previous review are no longer on the menu, but they've been replaced by things that are even better.  The dishes they churn out are always consistent and I can't really think of a menu item that I haven't liked. The mac and cheese is always a solid selection, as are the deviled eggs carbonara.  Tacos, bone marrow, dumplings, the Cuban sandwich... there's really something for everyone in terms of food and libations.  Whether I'm in the mood for casual cocktails and conversation or the perfect place to start (or end) my evening, the Summit fits the bill time and time again, and I imagine I'll be back with another 5 star review in due time."
"5.0","This place was such a cute Italian bistro! Our waitress was quirky and cute (the one with the accent, I didn't catch her name) and really knowledgeable of the menu! Overall a great place for a quiet dinner for 2!"
"4.0","They've got some good bubble tea. Not watery or lacking in flavor. I also ordered the tatsutaage chicken. It's good but there could be more chicken. It's a small amount."
"3.0","I was in the mood for Chinese food and it was limited to what was opened after 10 pm on a Friday night in Oakland and downtown Pittsburgh so I decided to try Chinatown Inn.  I got the mixed wonton soup which has wonton, noodles, broth, snap peas, water chestnuts, bok choy, Shrimp, and Chicken, it was very tasty.  The second thing I got was the all white meat general tso chicken and it was ok, the thing that was different is that there was pineapple in it and the sauce wasn't even really spicy  like it normally would be it was a toss between sweet and sour chicken and general tso chicken.  I can't really say much about the service but it was fast and efficient because I placed my order to go."
"5.0","Amazing. The squid ink pasta when in season is to die for. Their gnocchi is delicious. The atmosphere is cozy. I have never had a bad meal"
"5.0","I do not get a reason to eat at Capital Grille very often, however I needed to be in downtown Pittsburgh today for work lunch so I took advantage.  As always the service was spectacular and the food matched.  I had the ahi tuna which I think I have had each of the last two trips to Capital Grill.  It was amazing.  The rice was perfect as well as the asparagus.  Always perfect."
"1.0","I can't understand how this location has any positive reviews. The wait is always extremely long, the staff extremely unprofessional, and the bagel selection limited. I could list at least 20 examples of unhygienic, rude, and inappropriate behavior I experience on a daily basis here. I wish there was somewhere else to get a bagel on walnut. I have been holding out in writing a bad review for a long time but at this point it's just ridiculous. Every now and again there will be a couple of decent employees, but they seem to leave ASAP. I come here almost everyday."
"3.0","A few of us got together on a Wednesday night to check out the new noodle place. There were no tables available when we arrived so we decided to sit at the high tops along the wall looking at the street. Great people watching spot as long as you're ok with people from the street watching you eat as well! I got the miso eggplant appetizer to share which when it came out looked like a slug on a plate but was actually quite delicious. For the main dish I got the vegetarian curry but I added the chili paste to add a little spice. Again this was very good and adding the chili really gave it that extra kick it needed. The meal was good and I'd recommend people to definitely try. My only and biggest complaint was the service. Our waitress was not friendly, probably very busy, but was pretty much like what do you want and that was it. I had to practically wave her down to get a second drink which didn't arrive until she came over when we were finished and noticed I still hadn't received my drink. I mentioned I didn't want it unless it was already made and she gave it to me after we received our checks. I'm not asking for a free drink but if you're going to give it to me after I'm finished when I ordered it half way through the meal something would have been appreciated. Overall food was good, service something to be desired."
"5.0","All of their pies are delicious.  My favorite is the white boy.  The staff is extremely friendly.  Best pizza in Pittsburgh"
"5.0","Everything I've gotten at Streets has been exceptional-- the broccoli rabe pork sandwich and the jerk chicken skewers are my favorite. Their fries have cheese shavings on top, which I love. Love it!"
"3.0","After hearing so many great stories about this hole-in-the-wall place in Bloomfield-Lawrenceville section of the city, gave it a try, but was somewhat disappointed.Ordered Saigon soup. The broth had no depth and was quite bland, almost as if the boiling of the bones was done with only 30 minutes of cooking instead of 3 hours.  The meat were rectangular slabs of processed meat, as in Hormel Spam.  The vegetables were a few leaves of iceberg lettuce.  There was very little in the delicate blend of Oriental flavors.  This was a cheap truck-stop meal, prepared without love, using mass-produced and heavily-processed inexpensive food sources that one can get at Restaurant Depot by the case.On the plus side, the bowl was a dollar less than at other Vietnamese restaurants in the city. But I think I will now pay that extra dollar and get some real pieces of meat."
"2.0","Service was friendly, but it didn't make up for the less-than-sub-par Mexican food. Basically, every dish that we ordered was the exact same thing except it was either wrapped inside a burrito or laying on top of some nachos. I get that most of Mexican food can be like that, but really? It was obvious that they didn't invest any effort into recreating the dishes. It must have taken them 2 minutes each to make a dish since the ingredients were EXACTLY the same for each dish. Blah, even with the Groupon I didn't feel that justified the price of the meal! I could have had a better meal at Chipotle across the street...Also, the inside felt very plain Jane. It didn't feel like a restaurant... there's no ambiance or decor."
"3.0","Ok. I really liked this place when they first opened. I wrote a rave review about how much I liked it. My most recent visit left me highly disappointed. I ordered a chicken sandwich and a chicken and waffles combo. When I went to fill my drink, the area by the fountain drinks and utensils smelled rancid. It smelled like old garbage that college kids left in a room with the heat on all summer. When I filled my cup with coke, it came out as seltzer with little syrup. They fixed it. Cool. But the smell was still there. I got the food to go, which, especially with the chicken and waffles, I do not recommend. When you stay it's loaded with syrup and crack butter. This time it was packaged a bit differently and there was syrup on my fries (which I love) but not on the chicken or waffles and no butter!!! Maybe I never noticed before because of the butter but the waffle tasted worse than the kind you make at hotel buffets. The chicken tasted different than usual but was still okay. The real killer was the fries. Some were fine but most had that weird stale potato taste. I hope it was just an off day. Time will tell and I'll update again next visit."
"4.0","i love india on wheels! i'm a vegetarian and there are always tons of options. i've pretty much made my way through the veggie options at this point. food is always delicious (personal favs are the saag chole and chana masala) and the man who cooks is a delight. huge portion for a great price. i always get my food at a spice level 7 - i have moderate tolerance for spice - and it's perfect and consistent. (for people that order a 1-3 and say no flavor, what did you expect??)only downside is that the meals are often more rice than whatever i ordered. i asked for less rice once and they did oblige. as another reviewer noted, they are perpetually out of shrimp - i'm not sure why it's even on the menu at this point.around lunchtime, they can get SUPER busy - as in, once i waited 30 min for my food. huge line. but there's just one guy in there cooking, so it's understandable. also, CASH ONLY!"
"4.0","I'm certain most people have no idea what Hungarian food is. Sure, you've probably heard of  or even had 'goulash'.  But I assure you, that barely scratches the surface of this tasty, real comfort food cuisine. I consider myself a subject matter expert on Hungarian food. A dubious distinction you say? Ha. Taste the food at Huszar and then say that. I grew up with Hungarian food, my Hungarian grandmother taught me to make some dishes (along with a few curse words), and I've sought it out in my decades of travel domestically and internationally. I've eaten it all my life and even in Budapest. I can assure you I know legit Hungarian cuisine. This place has legit food. Full of flavor, comforting, appealing on every level, and a pure taste sensation. I was able to talk at length with the owner, Judy. She brought the chef out to introduce him to us. She recruited him in Hungary last year and convinced him to come over. He is doing fabulous things in that kitchen. We started with some red cabbage and cucumber salad appetizers. Both incredible. On to the chicken paprikas and porkolt. Awesome. Finished with the real test - sour cherry strudel and cottage cheese palacsinta. They were perfect We each had a Joe IPA draft (from Oregon) - haven't seen that beer anywhere around here. Delightful. Sure it may not be the high end restaurant you may normally seek out. This is a bar with great food. Solid 4 plus stars. Next time you're thinking you'd like some ethnic food, pass on those Italian, Indian, middle eastern, Chinese thoughts. Go for comfort. Get to Huszar. You'll be glad you did."
"5.0","I am so, so pleased with my experience here today. Three of us were walking around the Strip on a Saturday and we got pretty hungry around 1pm. I quickly pointed over across the street to this place since I've never been here. We walked in and were waiting on the hostess to seat us. I was looking around and most of the tables were full. Large TVs had march madness stuff going and orders were being delivered left and right. We waited not even five minutes to be seated, but the hostess appeared frazzled over so many people coming in.We were seated at a table in the back left. It was a spacious table with comfy chairs. Our waitress walked over within a few minutes and she was so quick to get our drinks. I got water and unsweetened iced tea. I looked over the menu and became way too excited for sushi. It's absolutely my favorite thing to eat so I was ready to order the whole menu. I narrowed it down to miso soup, seaweed salad, tuna & salmon sashimi. The two other people I was with ordered fish and chips, a burger, and an Alaskan roll. We chatted while we waited and I felt like our orders came out fairly quickly even though the place was busy. Also, I noticed how it wasn't insanely loud. A plus for sure. My unsweetened iced tea tasted strong and I liked that because most iced teas taste very watered down to me. Heidi, our waitress, brought over my miso soup and shortly after my sashimi and seaweed salad were delivered. Oh my gosh my sashimi was beautiful, fresh, and extremely delicious! The same goes for miso soup and seaweed salad, which was the tastiest I've had so far in Pittsburgh. I was head over heels for my food. I've finally found the sushi I've been dreaming of. Heidi was fabulous at keeping our drinks refilled and coming back to check on all of us. I liked that she didn't abandon us after getting us our orders.Towards the end of our meals, I decided I wanted to try a rainbow roll and asked if I could have it without rice. I wasn't trying to be a pain in the butt and I rarely ever ask for substitutions of any kind. Heidi said she'll see what she could do. She didn't say no and she didn't ignore my request. She put my order in and I was treated to an incredible modification with rainbow roll filling surrounded by a cucumber shell. It tasted amazing. I went over and praised/thanked the sushi chefs because they got creative and they provided excellent customer service. I thanked Heidi as well. She was so kind, bubbly, and an overall joy that added to our dining experience. We all adored her! Praise for the customer service, the food, and overall atmosphere. I was so happy and I'm definitely coming back for more of that sushi!"
"1.0","One of the worst experiences I've had at a Chipotle. Staff were unpleasant, and this location was very dirty. The staff made us feel as if any request was going to be a hassle for them. A lot of nasty looks and a lot of unnecessary huffs and puffs. This location is quite small, yet the upstairs area seemed to be untouched all day. All tables had food and used napkins all over the place. Trash cans were completely filled. I will not be back at this location. Definitely an unpleasant experience."
"4.0","Another pho place to add to my list!* Food: I woke up and craved two things that day- spring rolls and pho. And when I ordered these two from Tram's it just made my day. I've had some spring rolls where they use tiny shrimp which you can barely taste but Tram's stuff their rolls with big ones. I always love dipping it in peanut sauce and the ones that they make is definitely one of my favorites. I ordered their Pho Hanoi soup and there wasn't much I could complain about. I don't usually order rice dishes or other noodle dishes when I go to a pho place so I wouldn't have any expertise there.  * Cost vs. Worth: Their soups are around $11 each which is average for pho in Pittsburgh. Definitely worth the price!Will I come here again? - If I ever crave pho now, I will probably think about Tram's."
"5.0","A great mom and pop hole in the wall. Very busy location. Parking is a little difficult due too the small streets."
"4.0","If you come here, you better come here hungry.  This is a great Italian place.  You gotta come here with friends and family to make it worth while.  All of the plates are set up family style, so be ready to share... just like at mamma house!Our college's Italian Club came here for a night on the town.  The place was very accommodating.  We got a private room and a few servers to make sure our experience was as good as it could be.  The service was pretty good for a party of 18 on a busy Saturday night.  The waitress actually mistakenly gave us extra platters of cheesecake, but believe me we did not mind.The food was delicious.  Chicken Parmesan was my favorite, but the meatballs were a pretty close second.  Bread with oil and salads made a great antipasta for us.  All of the pastas the place made for us were pretty good too.  I mean nothing compares to my mom and grandma's, but the food was pretty good.  Like I said, the chicken  parmesan and meatballs were really good.The waitresses brought us some cheesecake for dessert.  Ehhhh it was alright.  We did not get to choose our desserts individually.  If we did, I probably would have went for the cannoli, but hey, the cheesecake wasnt too terrible.  My suggestion is try something else on the dessert menu.All in all it was a great time.  One of the best atmospheres to eat dinner at if you have a big group.  So, if you are looking for a place to celebrate something with a group of people or you just wanna go indulge in massive amounts of food, come to Buca."
"5.0","We decided to enjoy a Saturday night dinner at Ruth Chris for my wife Denise's and my sis Leah's birthdays. The meal was awesome, the service was great and the overall experience with my family and daughters there could not have been better. I tried to grab a bunch of pictures but you will see I had the New York Strip, the W and I each got different salads and shared w our girls, the table got 4 different appetizers, 5 different side dishes, and a bunch of desserts. We did plow through some bottles of Robert Mondavi merlot. I think this is a wonderful stop and they went above and beyond to make the kids happy too. They don't rush you and let you savor a great meal."
"5.0","Modest looking place  but a cut above typical Thai. First of all, they offer you spicing options on 0-10 scale, and so if you like your Thai food hot, or not , that's what you'll get. Second , they speak vegetarian and vegan.   Third, this is not a fancy pants type place.  The mango sticky rice dessert is especially good , the rice part more complex that many places."
"5.0","We went there on a game weekend. The wait wasn't too long. The food was amazing and the shots were good, try the Pancake shot! You won't be disappointed. Our waiter was George and he was by far the best EVER!!!!"
"4.0","The food here is amazing. Prices are expensive though :/ Great atmosphere to go and watch a game and get some beers with friends. It can be loud however. I got the shrimp salad and it was to die for! I recommend this place."
"5.0","Wow!  I love, love, love this place!  So good!  I was a bit skeptical about going to an ethnic food place in Pittsburgh because I've visited before and not had good luck.  Kassab's has prooven me wrong.  We had the Yogurt Salad and Moussaka with Mint Ice Tea.  I highly recommend this small whole in the wall to all that love Mediterranean / Lebanese cuisine and are fans of great service and a friendly atmosphere."
"5.0","The best pizza at the University of Pittsburgh. Cheap pies that are phenomenal in taste. Well worth the parking hassle to get this pizza. I've never had a bad pizza here!!"
"3.0","I went here to watch the Pitt Panthers bowl game this past weekend. It looks very fancy, typical of a restaurant in a casino. The ambiance was modern and cool. It's very big and there's plenty of tables there. There's even a VIP section. The food left something to be desired though. It's typical bar food. Absolutely nothing special about their food at all. I did enjoy their drink specials though. I've heard they always have nice drink specials so that's a definitely a plus. All in all, it's somewhere that I'd go to again, depending on the drink specials but I will not eat there expecting a meal to match the ambiance."
"5.0","This has become my new favorite Thai restaurant in the area.  The owner, Nokky, makes an effort to meet and interact with customers which gives the restaurant a personal and family feel.  Each time we've gone we've gotten a different soup and curry; we have never disappointed.  They grow most of their herbs and spices on premise. Open late and BYOB."
"2.0","From the outside of the restauarant I was hoping for a cute, quirky place. Unfortunately, it was a very underwhelming, boring, and forgettable meal."

"4.0","Soy garlic chicken with a less sweet lychee bubble tea.  It was quite tasty.  Can't wait to return."
"1.0","Ordered sweet and sour chicken for delivery. Delivery took well over an hour. The sweet and sour sauce was absolutely terrible (only way I can describe it is like sour ketchup) and sat on my stomach for over a day. I will not be ordering from here again."
"5.0","This is my second update to my original review. It appears they have taken constructive criticism to heart. I've been back to the location three or four times since my last update. All I can say is that the quality has continually improved. The french fries are even better than ever, a little less sweet and lighter on the seasoning so that the balance is better. The chicken remains excellent in its cooking. Where they have improved the most is their seasoning mixtures and technique. It looks like they Found the right mixture of dry and oil and seasoning. I have been able to get the plane, mild, and moderate mixes and enjoy them all, I think because the salt levels have come down so much and you can enjoy the overall experience better. I'm very happy to report all this, so I would encourage anyone that had some early misadventures here regarding the salt or seasonings to try it again.  They have really stepped up their game."
"5.0","I am here every Saturday morning following my espresso at La Prima. Ray has done such a great job creating place where there is always a place to sit, a staff wanting to help and serve you and delicious food to eat. In regards to breakfast I used to get the blueberry ricotta pancakes which are so good. However, lately I started getting the lox platter. Ray cures the salmon himself and it is so well done. Paired with the great ciabatta bread and toppings - you can't beat it. Also, do not forget the freshly squeezed orange juice too! I enjoy building my own, but if you would rather they have it already to go in sandwich form. If you would like to keep it more traditional, the sausage, egg and cheese on the croissant is always a good call."
"5.0","Celebrated a birthday last week up in the Cinderlands 'loft'  a fun and open area for a smaller (think 10 or less) group. We had great beer, food and service. Started with appetizers and then  ordered the dinner special, Lamb Shoulder with rice-tender and so tasty! Grace, our server was excellent, knowledgeable about the beers and what would complement each dish. Will be back for brunch, the menu looks great!"
"3.0","Food: Prince of India has an expansive menu consisting of everything you would expect from an Indian restaurant, and they also appear to have a buffet. We didn't order the buffet, so I can't comment about what is on it or when it is offered beyond confirming that a buffet option does exist. There are many meat and seafood options, and there is a menu page devoted exclusively to vegetarian items, one of the biggest vegetarian selections among Pittsburgh Indian restaurants that I've seen. We started with the Dall (lentil) soup, which was steaming hot and loaded with lentils and flavor. We also ordered the garlic naan, which was just as good as any other naan we've had in the city. For an appetizer, we tried the Samosa Chat which are samosas smothered in chick peas, tomatoes and sauce. There weren't many samosas (maybe 2 small ones), but there was an abundance of chick peas, and the sauce covering them was the best part of the entire dinner. The lead-up to our entrees was impressive, but we were slightly disappointed by the main courses. We ordered the Baingen Aloo, which was surprisingly bland and had little to no flavor or spice. We also ordered the Vegetable Mango Curry, which had considerably more flavor, but wasn't anything special. Entrees are ordered on a spiciness scale of 1-10, and the 7 I ordered was accurate; very spicy but not overwhelming. Overall, nothing we tried was bad, although the entrees left something to be desired after the excellent soup and appetizer.Price: Prices are very reasonable, particularly the entrees. The most expensive vegetarian entree was $10.99, and the majority were cheaper. The portion sizes are smaller than most Indian restaurants, but there is more than enough to eat your fill and likely bring some home. The soup was huge for only $2.99, and the appetizer, which was $4.99, was probably bigger than either entree.Drinks: There is a full bar and multiple beer selections, which is different than most of Pittsburgh's Indian restaurants, and definitely as asset. We ordered bottles of Taj Mahal, which we hadn't tasted before, and were surprised by how good it was. The menu also includes typical Indian non-alcoholic drinks like mango lassi and chai tea.Atmosphere: The dining room is large with tables for parties of all sizes. There was a group of 20+ sitting down the center of the room, so they can accommodate very large groups. The location directly on Fifth Avenue in Oakland makes parking tricky, particularly on weekend evenings. Overall, the atmosphere and decor are comfortable and casual.  Service: Our waiter was very attentive, filling our water glass almost obsessively. He spoke English, but not excellent, and struggled to answer some of our questions about the menu. Our soup and appetizers came together, which we didn't consider ideal, and our entrees were out before we had finished any of the earlier courses. But we definitely didn't have to wait for anything, including the bill.(+): fair prices, good food, good service(-): although nothing was particularly wrong, nothing was spectacularWould I go back again? Probably for lunch to get the soup and appetizer again, or, if giving dinner a second chance, I would try a more standard Indian entree like Chana Masala."
"2.0","I was excited to try Kiku due to the Yelp reviews when we stopped in Pittsburgh for a night en route to New York. Being a half Japanese woman living in Kentucky, I jump at the opportunity to get traditional Japanese at any chance I can get since my hometown is littered with sushi bars that specialize more in mayonnaise, fried, or spicy sauce laden fusion sushi rather than real Japanese food.  Kiku was definitely run by Japanese folk and the menu had the usual traditional fare. The food was pretty okay. We had the Agedashi Dofu which the broth was so mild it's taste didn't transfer well to the tofu. They garnished with green onion and daikon oroshi (grated radish) but didn't have the customary bonito flakes. They also charged a whopping $6 for probably a 2-1/2 ounce portion. I'd pay overblown prices for a good Agedashi Tofu, but this wasn't one. The Agedashi experience kind of defines the rest of our meal. Everything tasted okay but the prices were beyond ridiculous. We then realized we were in a touristy part of town and missed out on a lot of the amazing farm to folk fare in other areas. This place is meant to pull in hotel guests who aren't really looking for real culinary fare and are unaware they are getting raped by prices.  The tuna in our tuna roll was on it's way out, the smelt we ordered were just grilled with no sprinkle of sea salt or any kind of sauce--and again, a whopping $8 for three small fish. All sushi was ordered by the piece and about 20% more expensive they any other sushi bar I've been to outside of the Pacific Northwest, Tokyo, and NYC.  (Example: $6 for two pieces of salmon). The advertised 'mixed green salad' was cut with iceberg lettuce. The chawanmushi was bland and a small tea cup size. If you are charging $8 for chawanmushi, use real crab. At least snow crab. And throw in a ginko nut.  On the good side, the dressing was yummy, the salmon sushi was really fresh, and the service was decent. Overall, food is not awful but not exciting and the prices are beyond ridiculous for what you get."
"5.0","After my horrible experience with ECCO shoes, I've been writing about my positive experiences.  Beautiful place to have lunch.  Shaded tables, great food and service.  Fabulous fountain.  Cool place to have lunch on a hot day.  Loved the summer minestrone & the best iced tea.  Wish it was in Richmond."
"4.0","Quality food.  We enjoy the Sunday evening special. Some of our favorites are Gobi Manchurian, paneer tikka masala, the mixed tandoori plate. The staff is very friendly. The atmosphere is typical to many indian restaurants. The decor is simple."
"1.0","The food was great but customer service was shitty. Myself and another one of my friends returned our strawberry and mango margaritas due to the lack of flavor and I guess they didn't appreciate that. The first time we returned them, all we asked for was more flavoring, but it just made it worse so we asked them to just take them back and we'll stick to our waters and coke. As we continued to eat, our waiter literally glared at us the entire rest of our meal. When we chose to leave we noticed they automatically put a tip on our bills, so we crossed that out and entered our own. A few days later, I looked online at my bank transactions and noticed I was charged an extra $2.23. So i spoke to the manager and he couldn't even figure out why I was charged extra, but I knew it was because of that tip on the receipt I SCRATCHED out. He then told me he would just refund all our money but he doesn't want us to return due to us returning the drinks and the drinks were perfect. lol."
"5.0","This is my favorite place for dinner in Pittsburgh!! I love the cheesey capresey grilled cheese!! The staff was very friendly and helped me make a good decision on what i wanted to order. I was stuck between a salad and grilled cheese, and after talking with the waitress she said that the restaurant was known for their grilled cheeses and that i wouldn't be disappointed. i was sure not disappointed at all!!"
"2.0","For 6+ months I'd had a reservation for my son's rehearsal dinner at their first-date restaurant, Buca in Station Square. I only wish someone had told me they were overbooked for the night. We were a party of 40 put into a room for 30, with a separate area with 2 additional booths, not what I had expected and not a good way to 'Blend families' . We were also told there were 2 other rehearsal dinners that evening, which I'm assuming is why even though we were 20 minutes late for our reservation, it took another 30 min to get settled; we needed additional chairs, waited for salads & bread & champagne for a toast. For this 30 minutes we had 1 server for 40 people. Also, the temp inside was about 90 degrees, no lie. The 2 infants were down to only diapers in an attempt to cool them off. The staff told us they are not allowed to fan themselves to playoff the burning temp. You could see the sweat on the brow of many.  Our reservation was for 730. Around 820 we started to receive bread, etc. At 830 finally additional servers were able to jump in; I'm guessing one of the other dinners had ended by this point. Once we got the additional servers, the food & service was excellent. However, as the host it is very stressful to watch 40 people waiting for food and receiving the wrong drink orders if getting ANY at all. When I addressed each issue with the manger, first the dissatisfaction with the space and then at the end of the night the delay in service, she disagreed and almost argued with me. She gave me NO discount or satisfaction not that anything could have saved the night. We finished @ 1020pm, A bit late for the night b4 a wedding. I was so aggravated after planning this for months. I highly encourage you to consider other venues for your party.  Just not a good value; POOR MANAGEMENT!"
"2.0","I went here on a date with the Mrs. recently and thought was ok... but honestly was somewhat disappointed; and I don't think it was just a matter of high expectations, I think the food was in reality not that impressive (or at least not compatible with my palate). They had these confit chicken wings that I was super excited about but ended up being citrus flavored which was disappointing; had a sandwich that was ok, and something else not especially remarkable that I can't remember. Atmosphere was meh... there were a lot of bikers in the area flexing their motorcycles and periodically stopping in and being almost as loud with their yelling and obnoxious jokes. So, all in all not a good experience and probably won't go back."
"4.0","Kiku is a great and quaint restaurant. The service is good and the environment is very relaxing. The food took longer than I expected. The quality of the sushi was excellent. The Sake sampler was something new and nice."
"2.0","Went in for dinner on recent business trip. Tried the 'Taco night special', was informed it was a minimum of 4, so ordered although it didn't say that on menu. Tacos were small, very scant on filling, and pretty much flavorless.  Asked for hot sauce, Tabasco was only one available. Decided to try a cup of chili, as tacos weren't even close to filling. Chile tasted of green peppers and tabasco, no other flavors evident, near no meat either. Although door staff and waiter were very nice, I wouldn't recommend this place at all."
"5.0","This place is just terrific. The food we had was unique and amazing. We had salmon, octopus, salad, patatas and wine. Every dish was well blended with different ingredients and tasted delicious. Also the waiter was super nice and friendly. Such a great experience."
"4.0","Based on food alone I would give The Yard 2-3 stars, but because their drinks were so darn cheap they get 4 stars. They specialize in 'grilled cheese' sandwiches, which basically means they are just a type of melt. I got the 'mother of dragons' and was a little disappointed, but it wasn't terrible. With that being said it's a nice little place and a nice environment and not too expensive."
"5.0","The best pizza on the north side period. The buffalo chicken pizza is stellar and the ranch dipping sauce is addictive as hell. People that work there are always super nice and the price is very competitive. I have had their boasted chicken once or twice and it's good too. Definitely check this place out if u get a chance!"
"4.0","As a self-proclaimed Mexican food addict, te quiero Las Velas! Yum! Yum! Yum!  Las Velas had been at the top of my 'To Try' list for what seemed like eons, and I am happy to say I can finally check it off.  Not only was the food absolutely amazing, but the views of Market Square were fabulous as well.What I really liked about this place was the selection.  Everything from traditional Mexican dishes to having your tacos made 'Tex-Mex' style, allowing everyone in my party to eat within their own Mexican food comfort zone.  I ordered carnitas tacos. (Because I can't see carnitas on a menu and not order it.  It's just an impulse I have to live with.) They were everything I hoped and dreamed. Literally, I dream about these tacos. The pork was juicy and covered with fresh cilantro and lime, with just a hint of garlic  Ah, so good. The only draw back I can find with Las Velas is that the chips and salsa aren't free. Now, I grew up on the West Coast where paying for chips is almost unheard of, however I have noticed charging for these addicting crispy wonders is trend among Pittsburgh's Mexican restaurants. This is really a small complaint in my otherwise fantabulous first experience at Las Velas.  I will definitely be back to explore more of their great menu, chips or no chips!"
"1.0","Has been steadily going down hill for the past year or two.  Understaffed, under-cleaned, underwhelming."
"4.0","Such a fun place and the food is pretty good. I didn't realize Peppi's was a chain and just happened to stumble upon it on one of those lists on thrillist. The item that was featured in that list was the santucci sub. It's a hot mess Italian sandwich with double meat, double cheese, grilled peppers, mushrooms, and the like. HUGE. I got one and turned it into three meals. They also sell coke products..and that includes barq's red cream soda, which I hardly ever see like, anywhere. Anyway, the sandwich was a ton of food, as mentioned and all quite tasty. If you eat a lot of sub sandwiches, you may find this place pretty average. I don't actually think that the components stood out for any particular reason but the sandwich as a whole was really good - also I don't eat that many sub sandwiches so I don't have much frame of reference to compare to.In addition, the staff is so fun! As I was debating ordering a drink to go with my sandwich, we had an argument about coke v pepsi (to which the answer is pepsi, duh) and the guys were joking around the whole time that my friends and I were waiting for our food. This particular location had a small seating area behind the ordering / prep station but we took our food to go. I'm not sure if all locations have seating area..I didn't actually realize this place was a chain until quite recently. I don't know about parking in this area. Probably not great since it's downtown. If that deters you, try another location. There are several around and those probably have better parking options."
"4.0","Cool vibe definitely. I think the tacos could be a little better however, I'm sure after a long drunken night- these tacos would taste amazing. I will update my review once I stumble in here again after a fun night out."
"4.0","This was one of the better fast food meals I've had. My husband and I both had the $4 meal: a double cheeseburger, spicy chicken sandwich, fries, and drink for 4 bucks. The man working the counter was about 1000 times more friendly and competent than at most fast food joints. They have a ton of fountain drink choices. Also, they bring the food to your table for dining in which is nice, so you're not awkwardly lingering by the counter. All of the food was hot, fresh, and tasty. Plus, a very clean restroom. Wish there were more Hardee's around Pittsburgh, and I'll definitely return to this one!"
"4.0","In the mood for comfort food, then The Yard is a solid choice. We've been twice now with out of town guests and our newborn, and besides accidentally spilling tomato soup on myself (klutz) have really enjoyed ourselves. I've gotten The Simple Jack and can't wait to try more of their grilled cheese options. The Mac Attack was also enjoyed by everyone at our table as a shared appetizer. One slight critique is that the tomato soups has a kind of smokey after taste, that's just not up my alley. It's perfectly fine for dipping sandwiches and fries, but eating it on it's own, not so much."
"4.0","I love a good beer selection so I was excited to check this place out. Plus it's in market square! The beer selection was nice but not super unique. It had a nice variety to appeal to most beer drinkers but if you are looking for something new, this might not be the place. We stopped in for lunch but I wasn't very hungry so I ordered the chopped salad. When it came out, I was a little underwhelmed with how it looked but it was delicious! I actually thought about it for the next week. Everyone else in my group seemed to really enjoy their food. I would definitely stop back in the next time I'm in market square."
"5.0","These aren't just the best burgers in Lawrenceville, but in all of Pittsburgh! I've tried most of their specialty burgers, and love them all. Their fried chicken sandwiches are also as good as it gets! Their house brewed beer is tasty (though not the best in Lawrenceville, but I'm not reviewing for that.) Great lunch stop!"
"5.0","I'm so glad I finally got to stop in here! Every time I ride my bike I always thinking about stopping. The other day my fiancé and I stopped in to grab a coffee and tea. She got the lavender lemonade tea. It was a little bitter but the barista sweetened it a bit which made it better. I would definitely order it again. I got the coffee latte with milk. It was more just coffee and milk than a latte. There was no foam in the drink at all. Either way the coffee had good flavor. The mood is very welcoming inside to anyone! There were kids with their parents, people working on laptops and couples talking around the corner. There is a big couch to lounge on and an electronic fireplace to make the room even more cozy! I am excited to visit in the future again to try more items on the menu. If you live in North Side this is a must go to place!"
"5.0","I feel like most Japanese restaurants don't have Tare as an option, so I need to point out that Umami definitely has an amazing variety of food. This place is unique and has some of the best sushi you can find in this town.I tend to make my own Tare platter when its an option and as you can see from the picture I posted, I was most definitely happy with the food. I highly recommend reserving a table for a fun date night (the app they partnered with isn't the easiest to navigate but its worth knowing you have a reserved spot at this hard to get into restaurant)."
"1.0","DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE! they 100% of the time mess up the order, regardless if it's 1 item you're ordering or 5. I guarantee you they will not get one item correct. They won't refund your money when they make a mistake nor will the fix the mistake by cooking the item again. The pizza/calzone/breadsticks are NEVER cooked thoroughly."
"5.0","I went for lunch this monday and had the london broil, grilled flank steak with roasted sweet potatoes over mixed greens.  I wanted to try their signature capon and ditallini soup but they were out.   Their complimentary starter, white bean dip with bits of celery, red peppers, carrots and drizzled with balsamic vinegar is scrumptious.  The steak was the best i've had in a while although a bit too rare; the next time i go i'll bring along a bottle of red to enjoy with it, obviously i will definitely be going back.  I used to live within five minutes of a walk from Sausalido but had never tried the place out :(.  It's a gem in Pittsburgh and probably the best place to eat in Bloomfield.  I also had their turkey havarti sandwich with asparagus and basil mayo...it was pretty much a perfect sandwich definitely worth nine dollars.  It's a small cozy place with the cutest bathroom for women that I have ever been in.  The bathroom had a canvas of marilyn monroe and her quote 'I am not interested in money.  I just want to be wonderful,' on the wall."
"2.0","Had the spicy chicken rigatoni, and it was delicious.  The sauce to pasta ratio was too high, so if we lived in the area, we'd have taken the leftovers and could have eaten two more meals by adding some extra pasta.The service was terrible.  We ate here the night before running the Pittsburgh half marathon.  The place was busy, but there were a few empty tables around us.  Our waitress took at least 20 minutes to do everything.  Twenty minutes before our order was taken, 20 more minutes before we got our drinks.  Half an hour to bring us dessert, and yet another 20 minutes to get our check, and almost half an hour to take our credit card.  We were at the table for over 2.5 hours.  She was almost never in the room, so we're not sure what she was doing, but it was some of the worst service we've had in quite some time."
"5.0","Fortunate to have Benny's here in the Southside. A VA gem that snuck over the Mason-Dixon Line. Ridiculous large 30' pizza NY Style, cannot be beat."
"1.0","Just so so. Left hungry. sushi was small portions at large prices. They must have worked hard to slice the sushi so thin. Spent too much for too little. The quality wasn't anything to write about so I won't."
"4.0","It's a nice convenient place to grab breakfast or lunch on your way to the office. My main complaint was they require a $10 minimum purchase to use a credit card. So basically you need cash on you to go here. That was really the only thing I didn't like about the place, other than that the food was pretty decent."
"5.0","Really really good!  Loved the bar atmosphere and the food was amazing!  I had the hanger steak which was YUM!  Our server was perfect too!!"
"5.0","This is the best vegan place to eat in Pittsburgh. Great customer service and the food is delicious. The place is decorated with punk rock flyer and poster. I would like to give this place a A+ for that."
"4.0","I was a little skeptical off all of the 5 star reviews, but I don't think I set the bar too high for my first visit to Thai Gourmet.  The service was good and the food was good.  It was my first experience with lemongrass soup, which unfortunately isn't my thing, but I was looking forward to my pad kee mow, which was tasty and spicy.  I went with the 4 stars instead of the typical 5 because it didn't make my list of favorite Thai food.  I will be sure to check it out again and make sure my review still applies.  The lunch specials have a decent variety and the dishes are reasonable, so I'll be here again sometime."
"4.0","Listen. It's a chain. They've been around a for while. But it's not always a negative thing. The service was excellent and my steak was perfect, so there's no knock against them for that!My husband wanted to come here for our anniversary. Since I dictate about 90% of the restaurant choices we make, I figured this was my anniversary gift to him! I was pleasantly surprised how nice of an experience it was. They semi-recently remodeled and moved their bar to the lobby of the PNC building. It throws you off a little, but they must have needed the room for more seating? Although I will say, I made our reservations online a couple days before on a Friday night with ample time slots available. It still has that same dark decor and ambiance it used to have. I would have figured they'd mix it up a little, but hey, they have a brand/image they want to go with, so I can't fault them.My tomato salad was good, and thankfully had some fresh tomatoes, even at the tail end of tomato season. I ordered the filet, and like I said, it was perfect. It was a pretty large filet and I devoured the whole thing. No regrets on that. We ordered the cauliflower app, and although they said there would be capers in it, there definitely wasn't. The dish missed something without them. The scallop potatoes were cheesy goodness though, so that made up for the bland cauliflower. Our server was friendly and really good about accommodating me being gluten free. A handful of items on the menu are GF, so it's super easy to navigate. They even gave us a complimentary ice cream dessert for our anniversary. Happy we had such a great experience at an established restaurant."
"3.0","This pizza joint's signature is serving up huge slices and pies. They're as big or even bigger than the ones served up by Pizza Sola. Unfortunately, the flavor of the pizza doesn't measure up to the size. The crust wasn't very crispy. The end of the crust was pretty much a bread stick. The tomato sauce didn't have much flavor, and the cheese wasn't as savory as I like.I would rate Benny Fierro's two and a half stars."
"1.0","Absolutely the worst bar I've ever been in.  The severs never came to our table and we stayed for hours.  Getting up and getting our own food and drink.  Stay away from this bar, they judge your appearance at the front door.  And serve you accordingly.  Yuck...."
"3.0","More like 3.5 stars than 3, but not quite 4. Service was great. I came in with a coworker for lunch and the first thing the bartender asked us was if we were on a lunch break. That's key. Great when people understand that we only have a certain about of time to dine. We had the steam buns for an app, they were good. Bun itself was very good along with the aioli, chicken was decent. I had the Rayu Paitan and my coworker had the Miso Paitan. I enjoyed it, but I don't think it was anything I will crave. I've had other ramen and while I did appreciate the attention to detail at Yuzu, the flavor was missing something. My coworker said his Miso was overly salty and he usually loves Miso. I'd go back, but probably not until I'm really really looking for Ramen on my lunch break again."
"4.0","I took friends here from out of town so many times after this place was recommended to me. I've probably been here 10 times. It is a little bit small and I believe it's cash only. The people who work there are nice and easy to talk to. The food tho... its so good. I usually get some type of fried rice with tofu whenever I eat Asian food and this place was of my favorite. Big portions!"
"5.0","Doce is the best! My first time in I made the mistake of ordering flour instead of corn tortillas, luckily they made me try the corn because that makes all the difference!  The carnitas are delicious and the weekly specials can be great too!  This is my go-to place in the south side, dinner or late night. Also, I don't typically like beans, but theirs even get me.... I'll put Doce up there as tied for the best tacos in the city!"
"4.0","I adore Chick'n Bubbly! I work nearby and come in every six weeks or so to get my crispy KFC and takoyaki fix. They serve strips, chicken on a stick, a variety of sides, and boba teas in addition to the aforementioned items.I almost always order the spicy soy sauce on my wings, as the other one is too goopy and sweet for my taste. The snack size with a side is enough for an average lunch, since it consist of six large wingettes double fried in a crispy coating. Their takoyaki (fried octopus balls drizzled in kewpie and brown sauce) are small and best eaten fresh, since they become soggy very quickly. With that said, they satisfy the takoyaki craving I developed while working at Umami, seeing as how a table there is a hot commodity nowadays! Their boba teas are solid as well, and they offer almond milk for people like myself who can't drink regular milk. I only occasionally order tea though, since it's more like a dessert than a beverage. Chick'n Bubbly meets the need for solid KFC and cheap eats in the Oakland area. I'm glad to work nearby and I'm sure I'll be a fairly regular customer for the foreseeable future!"
"4.0","We rolled through at around 10 pm on August 12th to check out the soft opening, and were very pleased. We didn't try any of the appetizers, though we would have liked to try the kim chi (they were out). We sat upstairs at the bar facing the kitchen and saw several plates of the fried cauliflower go out, and it looked quite tasty.The limited menu ended up being just fine, as we thought both the Shoyu Ramen and Shio Ramen sounded great. We both added chili paste for $1, as lovers of all things spicy. Both were fantastic, and the homemade noodles really stood out. They have a bit more of a bite to them than your usual ramen noodle, which I enjoyed, though they didn't soak up the broth as much. Nicely sized portions with plenty of ingredients mingling in the bowls. I've already seen even more appetizing items have been added to the full menu, so it will be nice to check the place out again once the usual Pittsburgh wintry winds come through.Service left a little to be desired that night, and the noodles took longer than we were expecting. The waitress seemed eager to leave for the night and we felt rushed to order and finish eating. It wasn't quite the end of the night yet, with a couple hours left, but hopefully some of these issues will be resolved as the restaurant matures."
"5.0","Think Yogurtland or Razzy Fresh but for Chinese food. I believe this place is under the same ownership as Love Ramen, so similar layout with the board games and self-cleanup. It's $0.90 per oz, so I recommend keeping watch of what you're grabbing. Get the meat before you get vegetables, and opt for the dry spicy mala so you get rice with your meal instead of adding noodles to your bowl. If you do get noodles, pick a dry noodle. Generally pretty well kept and staffed. Although the place is self serve, staff is constantly replacing the items in the fridge to make sure it's fresh. Will be back again. Would not be surprised if this place becomes a hidden gem."
"4.0","I stopped by here a couple of Sunday's ago with my wife for my birthday dinner with her.  This wasn't our original choice of restaurant but whenever the first one fell through we were happy to be able to quickly make reservations at Station.  Whenever we finally had made it to Bloomfield and entered the restaurant I was a little confused.  All that I saw was a bar area and a few other tables to sit at.  Whenever we checked in with the hostess she led us to a second room of the restaurant which had some diners and many more tables.  The inside of Station has an industrial feel and I find it rare in restaurants to find painted black walls like they have here.I decided to start off the evening by having a cocktail and went with the paisley park.  It ended up being a good choice as the drink was flavorful and had a slight tartness to it which I really enjoyed.  Then for my entree I went with the tagliatelle with my wife went with the burger.  My entree consisted of smoked pork, soffrito, a 1 hr egg and some parmesan cheese but it was really my wife's burger that caught my eye.  It looked amazing and she confirmed that it was while allowing me a small taste.  My meal ended up being quite good.  The egg when broken open had a nice a runny yolk that helped to cover the pasta and give some more savoriness.  I also really enjoyed the sauce for the pasta.  It wasn't a flavor that I could properly identify but it was pleasing.  The pork on the pasta was also good since it was cooked properly and had a light smoky flavor to it.  Overall the flavors melded together to make a nice tasting dish.The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  My drink was good and while I enjoyed the food i ordered, I have to admit that I was jealous of my wife's burger."
"4.0","Seafood was really nice, flavourful and fresh. Service was good, ambience is relaxing"
"1.0","Great food and awful service. Waited 25 minutes for coffee and over an hour for an omelet (and the order was wrong) and grits. Their food is great and their service is awful. Same experience here on 3 different occasions. I'm done giving them chances."
"5.0","Great ambience, wonderful to be sitting at the bar in full sunlight! The City Works burger was fantastic, and the bartender, Lauren was prompt with service and super friendly. Randomly walked into this place looking for lunch and a few beers - it checked the boxes perfectly.Heartily recommend."
"4.0","Great outdoor spot. Beer selection is OK, not the Yard House by any stretch of the imagination, and pricey. Mediocre drafts command a princely sum compared to other places. However when all is said it is very fun to hang out here. Bar staff are friendly."
"5.0","The pizza is so good whyyy did i find this place. If i could rate it 10 I would. The staff is super friendly. The options are endless. The soda is good too. I have to make this a treat on cheat days because i would otherwise go at least 2 times a week ha lol."
"4.0","Make your own breakfast sandwich?  Now you're talking!  This was the morning perk-up and fuel location for us on this fine Friday.  The people that work there are hip and awesome and the coffee came out scorching hot and the food is made quick and delivered to your table via pony express.  Also impressive is the aesthetics of the interior, being two levels with paintings and such decorating the walls.  This would be a regular stop for me, if only I lived in this town."
"5.0","This place is ahmazing!! From start to finish everything was delicious! For the first 2 courses, we had the oxtail montadito, foie blonde, chicharron, octopus, and tomato salad to start. The stars were the oxtail, octopus and tomato salad. The oxtail came with 2 pieces - deliciously spiced chunks atop toasted baguette with melted mahon cheese. The octopus starter could have been more generous - but maybe that's just because i wanted more more more!! The tomato salad was scrumptious as well - the whipped feta and harissa really kicked up the lightness of the tomatoes! The other 2 starters weren't quite as exciting: the foie blonde was disappointing - it tasted like strawberry cereal in french toast, which didn't highlight the richness of the pâté. The chicharrons were also nothing to really write home about. For a main entree we got the 16oz new york strip steak. It was AWESOME and came with the setas a la plancha (the oyster mushrooms with shallots). There was a scrumptious balsamic/red wine-like reduction glaze that complemented the steak perfectly! To finish, we got the crema catalana and man oh man we were not disappointed! It was essentially a frozen version of creme brûlée but somehow tasted even better than the classic!! The custard had more of a ice cream/frozen custard-y richness which was perfectly balanced by the crisp sugar crust on top. YUM. Highly recommend for a celebratory dinner, anniversary, or date night!"
"3.0","My husband and I got some slices to go from here and were really unimpressed for the price. Having recently moved here from NYC, this seemed not even as good as a dollar slice. Bland, nothing special with the crust or the cheese or toppings. Maybe the whole pizzas are better, but the slice to go seemed like not a great move. Was happy they had cracked red pepper and cheese to top the pizza with at least. Since we tried this place we also tried Spirit, and I liked Spirit's pizza a lot more."
"5.0","Our favorite pittsburgh restaurant of 2015- well rounded with excellent cocktails and satisfying portions of delicious food. Nice hipster atmosphere.Veggie perspective- I absolutely love the roasted carrot small plate (lovely roasted flavor with rich puffy chickpea puffs and yummy fresh cheese) which I get to share as an appetizer (loved even by carnivores) and I've gotten the caramelized cabbage and taleggio ravioli twice now and it is full of umami and super filling for someone who is skeptical of pasta as the only veggie main dish. Look forward to dinner here every time!Carnivore perspective - my husband loved the grilled Bavette steak- perfectly medium rare and a great portion.Cocktail lovers- the old fashioned here can't be beat- my husband often orders two or three of them."
"4.0","Good value for money especially from our experience with Boston and NYC restaurants. Service could be better, nothing major but small things that matter - like getting all food out together. Food is tasty and authentic."
"5.0","Pasha is the best spot for a casual yet lovely dining experience ! A great place to eat Turkish food in Shadyside. I like to take coworkers and friends to eat @Pasha for lunch and/or dinner because I know I can trust the taste, quality and service."
"4.0","We have been to city works a few times and always enjoy yourselves. The food is over priced for the portions that you receive. The beer and drink selection is vast and all the reason to come. The atmosphere can be loud but what do you expect from a wildly open concept sports bar?  There are plenty of TV's to catch all the games! I've always found it to be clean to include the bathrooms. Ask for the waiter Ryan. He is attentive, quick, funny, and probably the best staff that we have ever had at any restaurant. Four stars because the food is over priced for the portions. Plus the food is not high end. It's traditional American food."
"5.0","One of the best breweries in Pittsburgh. In only a short amount of time they have separated themselves from the rest. Really great beer AND really great food. It seems it is usually one or the other but they have managed to do both great!  The service also is amazing from management to the servers. Do yourself a favor and give them a shot."
"4.0","I went to meet a girlfriend the other night at Station! I can't believe I have never gone! While, I didn't get a chance to eat, the food that I witnessed smelled and looked (read cheesy pasta) amazing!!! The space is really cute inside and I would definitely love to go back for a date night or a ladies night out! While I didn't have the opportunity to stuff my face with carbs, I did get to have cocktails (liquid diet for the holidays, ya know?). The gun street girl was really delicious and refreshing! Bourbon and rose water...how perfect! They also made a mean dirty martini!! Can't wait to return!!"
"4.0","Panera Bread. The Paradise Bakery of the east.There is plen-ty of seating at this location. And the staff was very friendly.Since they are the Paradise of the east, I was already familiar w/ their menu. So, I opted for the Parmesan tortellini and a half of a Fuji apple chicken salad. Our food came out quickly, which is nice cuz I was starving. Ive said it before and Ill say it again, their pasta portions are way too small, but delicious. And I love the Fuji apple salad. The chicken has some great seasoning, theres dried cranberries, walnuts, blue cheese, tomatoes, and apple chips on it. W/ some fruity vinaigrette, its the perfect combination.And apparently on the east coast, they sub out the free cookie w/ some free bread.Id definitely recommend this place over the hotel its attached to."
"4.0","When we first walked in, we couldn't help but admire how trendy the restaurant was. Umami is a bit tucked away as the entrance is to the left of Round Corner Cantina and you have to walk up two flights of stairs. I do recommend getting a reservation beforehand since the restaurant isn't huge. It was really neat seeing the open kitchen and how they prepare the food. My friend and I each ordered the pork belly robatayaki skewer. The chunks of pork were large, tender, slightly charred, but lacking some flavor. Next we shared the takoyaki. There were six takoyaki balls with shaved katsuobushi on top. The takoyaki had good flavor but lacked an outer crispy skin. The kewpie sauce was generously available on the plate so you could dip as much sauce as you wanted. I ordered the zaru soba. It comes with a skewer of grilled salmon, which was excellently made as the salmon meat was exceptionally tender and fell off the skewer as I tried to eat it. The soba noodle sauce is more tart than traditionally sauces I've had since it's made with ponzu sauce. I found the tartness equally, if not more, delicious. My friend ordered the tonkotsu ramen. I only tried a bite, but the broth seemed very rich and authentic. Service overall was excellent."
"3.0","Good looking chicken wings but it tastes like the chicken meat and fried part are separate. Should be drier like the other regular K style fried chicken."
"4.0","Glad to be able try Station so soon after it opened. Met my wife and another couple for dinner.In regards to the cocktails. Between the four of us 2e tried the Manhattan, the Negroni and a cocktail of bourbon, lemon and an ipa. The Negronis were top not. I enjoyed my Manhattan, though I do hope they expand their cocktail menu on our next visit.For appetizers we shared the heirloom tomato salad and the wings. Highly recommend both. I really enjoyed the cream on the wings.In regards to entrees we tried the pork belly and roasted pork, chicken with savory bread pudding, hanger steak, and pork shank with pasta. I would say all the meals were good but nothing amazing. We each liked parts of our meals but felt other parts were lacking. I had the pork belly and roasted pork. The pork belly and roasted carrots were great. I felt the roasted pork, while done properly, was a bit over salted. None of us had room for dessert, but the couple next to us both said the popcorn and the loaf cake were very good (they both looked very tasty).Highly recommended. Glad to have new type of restaurant in the Bloomfield area. Will definitely head back."
"5.0","This spot is AMAZING! We tried the avocado toast, falafel wrap, shwarma, and cashew cheese flat bread. All were spot on. We also grabbed hummus and pita to go which were ridiculously good. The hummus is yummy and not soaked in oil like most places. And then there are the desserts... cookies, house made chocolates, cake!! Oh my! So good!!!! Didn't even get to explore the coffee menu. Wish we lived closer. Thanks for creating such a delicious vegan spot!"
"2.0","I had the soy garlic wings and almond milk tea here. The almond milk tea tasted very powdery and tasted exactly like the instant Greenmax brand almond tea with hazelnuts. The soy garlic wings were quite disappointing. The sauce was more like honey, sweet sauce and the wings were not very crispy. Any of the wings at the bottom of the box or covered by others wings were all soggy. Why buy fried food if it is soggy?"
"2.0","I like their salads (good quality ingredients, tasty dressing, generous portions), but they have got to do something about their long lines during lunchtime. It takes about 15-30 minutes to create your salad from start to finish. I recommend changing a step in the process in the assembly line to improve the process / make it more efficient. Perhaps by removing the chopping function to reduce wait time."
"5.0","Great spot off Walnut. It's BYOB, and the food is delicious, and priced well too. I got the whole fish of the day, a sea bass, which was grilled perfectly. The mixed platter is a tasty assortment of salads, vegetables, and dips served with warm pita. The ambiance and service is ideal for a date or casual dinner with friends."
"4.0","I went in looking to expand my new found taste for IPAs. This is a great place to do that because you can mix and match! A staff member came over and asked me my preferences and helped me to pick out a few brews. Of course I forget which ones they were, but I do remember that I liked them. Definitely costs a bit more to do it this way. I haven't tried the food yet so I cannot leave a complete review on that (yet!).But I do enjoy the casual/intimate vibe here and like the two tables out front in the summer time."
"2.0","I wasn't too satisfied just recently. Which I'm sad to report. Everything tasted so seasonless, especially the sides. The greens tasted like it was just boiled in water. And the stuffing was extremely runny. The chicken was, eh ok. I was very disappointed. :("
"5.0","I LOVE this place. The food and service are extraordinary. Please stop complaining if you didn't think to call ahead and get a reservation. Luke is an amazing owner that genuinely cares about your dining experience."
"5.0","I swung by this place after a meeting because I had never seen it before. Overall I was impressed. The wait wasn't long, the service was friendly, and I got my chicken & waffle to-go pretty fast. The vibe in the restaurant seemed pretty tight too. I got mine medium to try out their spicy levels and it would be just right for an average spicy chicken seeker. The waffles were pretty good and the combo itself was just too too good.I would also recommend getting their potato salad. It's beyond delicious with the chicken."
"1.0","Overall:  If you're going for a show, great, go, support local Pittsburgh artists, please.  If you're going for food and/or mixed drinks, don't.  Just get a beer, because anything more advanced is beyond the staff's abilities.  Details:  Two friends and I went there for dinner on a Saturday night.We came in because we were enticed by the chicken pot pie special advertised on the sandwich board on the sidewalk (even though none of us ordered that particular dish).  While the big TV in the corner of the dining area wasn't ideal, there weren't any other customers (which should have tipped us off), but we figured we could get a quick bite and be on our way to a party that started around 8:30 at a different Lawrenceville establishment.During the course of our time there (about 45 minutes total), only 2-3 other parties came in.  The server had no more than four tables the whole time we were there, so the poor service we received can not be excused as him being overwhelmed by customers.When I asked what type of Pinot Grigio was available, the server replied:  'What do you mean?'  I elaborated and explained: 'You know, like, Ecco Domani, Fisheye, what brand?'  He told me he didn't know, and went to check.  By the time he got back, I had found on the drink menu that Yellowtail was the brand that was carried, which I don't care for, so I ordered a 'Moses,' which was awful, but I didn't complain, and he didn't ask. I admit, I am a somewhat 'particular' customer.  When I placed my order, I told the server I was a bit 'difficult,' and after taking my order, he replied that it wasn't difficult at all.  He lied.I ordered the Dublin Club and added a side salad for $1 upcharge.  I asked the server if I could have the sandwich dry, with mustard on the side, and substitute Swiss cheese for the American cheese that came on it, and he replied: 'Maybe, I'll have to see if we have Swiss cheese,' to which I replied, 'Oh, well, I figured you did, since it's an ingredient on other sandwiches on the menu.'  I wasn't trying to be argumentative or flippant, just logical.  I also told the server that I didn't want to see any onions anywhere on any of my food.  At this time I also pointed out that our table didn't have any flatware.When the server brought my side salad there were chopped onions on it, and he still hadn't brought us our flatware roll-ups, so I had to remind him about that again.Although the Balsamic Vinaigrette dressing was decent, the salad was wilty and tasted like it had been made the day before and left to sit in the fridge.When my club arrived, I lifted the bread and saw mayonnaise, so I took the plastic ramekin of mustard which was in the basket and sent the sandwich back.  My companions began to eat their food.  By the time they were halfway done, the second sandwich came out, and the server did apologize for my wait.  My second sandwich had American cheese AND Swiss cheese on it.  I peeled the American cheese (which I had specifically requested not be on my sandwich in the first place) off, stuck it on the table, and proceeded to eat.My one friend ordered the Pittsburgh salad, which he said was okay, but there were only 6-7 fries on it, and my other friend ordered pretzels, which she said were alright.When we got the bill, I was further irritated by the fact that we were charged $1 for the Swiss cheese on my Dublin club.  If there was going to be an upcharge for the type of cheese I wanted, I would've just gotten it without cheese.  It was irresponsible customer service on the server's part not to inform me of that.The server was somewhat pleasant, but he clearly had little knowledge of the menu, didn't seem to know how to get an order to and from the kitchen correctly, and had to be reminded twice that the customers needed roll ups.I refused to leave more than a 10% tip and, since there isn't a way to get to a manager through the website, I actually took the time to print out and snail-mail a letter of complaint."
"4.0","TOP NOTCH! We were visiting from out of town and cruised Yelp for some ideas for dinner. This was a great find. The Kentucky Fig and the Seasonal Mule were a great start and it continued from there. We are from TX and we love our beef and the burgers were to die for. They were cooked perfectly and just the right size. We will be back!"
"5.0","My favorite Japanese restaurant.  Sushi is excellent, but the kitchen items are exceptional.  Authentic.  This place's chawa mushi, age dashi tofu, and katsu don are the standards I use to compare any other Japanese restaurant's food."
"5.0","Tacos are street food and this place makes no pretenses about that. You get tacos. Delicious tacos without any frills. It's not upscale, it's just tacos. I could eat here every meal every day"
"4.0","It has one of the best restaurant week menus. In summary, the food was decent and the indoor decor was classic, but we felt it was a little overpriced with the regular menu. I was expecting more carefully designed dishes, in the sense of more delicate flavors and more beautiful plates. However, it was a good deal  to come on restaurant week. Clam chowder: very creamy, thicker than others I've had. Bleu cheese salad: it was half a cabbage with salad sauce and some bleu cheese. It was fine. Nothing special.Filet Mignon: I had better and cheaper(in regular menu, it is almost 50) filet mignon before. It was soft but I felt they only use salt for the flavor. NY strip: Tasted similar as the filet mignon, but it was a little burnt outside.We liked the sides for the steak. The smashed potato was very creamy and buttery. Cheesecake: a little too soft. Chocolate cake: very bitter, I can tell it was made with pure dark chocolate."
"4.0","Thank god this Buca has the old menu!Linguine with meat sauceVeal Parmesan Fried CheeseI love their fried cheese, it doesn't look or taste like it came from the Sam's Club freezer. Their Veal Parmesan is also amazingly good for a chain restaurant. It comes out crisp even though it is covered with sauce. I don't make it hear very often due to the abundance of local restaurants in the city, but when it gets late or I am close I have no issue stopping by."
"3.0","Been here several times before more recently went with my boyfriend because it was his first time going. We ordered an appetizer I believe it was shrimp I don't have a picture but it was really good it came on a bed of lettuce which was great. I have pictures of what we ordered the service was good the food was much tastier this time than it has ever been before in the past. I would say the menu was not extraordinary but for what it is it's okay"
"4.0","Was a really nice experience to have lunch here. Especially when the craving was for Indian food. Chicken Tikka n Butter Chicken Combos were delicious. Got a feeling of mini India in Pittsburgh!"
"3.0","Came here for lunch last week with a group of friends.  Started with a heaping order of avocado and peanut butter toast.  Both were excellent, especially the avocado. We also had the latkes which were good but not great.  I also ordered a 3 mezze sampler.  The hummus was fresh but the babaganoush was lacking for sure (I barely had more than a few bites).  We also had the falafel sandwich (which was pretty good but again not amazing, I don't think they make their pita fresh) and the cashew cheese sandwich.  The cashew cheese was pretty gross but that's not their fault as it's never very good (may taste ok going down but your stomach will be bloated and hurting for hours after).If you are craving interesting vegan food in Pittsburgh, I would recommend going to Apteka and skipping this place."
"5.0","Stop down for a late lunch....the best food in the Southside. Chef Matt and Lauren have brought the world to Pittsburgh. My burger was fantastic. And my arancini was amazing. Finally the Southside has a restaurant to be proud of!"
"3.0","QDOBA is the less satisfying version of Chipolte, and if I were to rate QDOBA by itself I'd give it 2 stars. I have been really happy with this specific location on multiple occasions. The staff are all really nice and or remains pretty clean and organized, even when it's busy. You can expect this place to be busy during lunchtime Monday through Friday."
"5.0","Very good service ....wonderful! If I could bring them to Va beach with me I would eat there all the time . The presentation of the food is just fantastic. The taste was even better I have recommended this restraint to everyone who has asked me."
"3.0","Actually, for a Panera, this was quite nice.I was at the Petersen Event Center and this was a quick walk down the hill....idiot me never realized I'd eventually have to go back up the hill.The restaurant is huge...they must have room to seat 300 people, and every visit it's always been packed.Surprisingly, this Panera, for its location has a decent staff.  They're quick and they prepare their easily prepared national chain foods quickly.Personal pet peeve that Panera's are Pepsi establishments but soda and pop are bad for you and I shouldn't drink it anyways."
"2.0","Im sorry, I have to disagree with all the reviews that said the pho was decent - it was not. Very disappointed"
"2.0","My tea was the only thing good and it was hot water with a Lipton pack tossed on the table. These sandwiches could be so awesome. The fries on the sandwich were soggy and tasted like old grease. The cold slaw was similar to sauerkraut with a strange tangy flavor. I ordered the fish sandwich which was the size of a deck of cards hidden under fries and slaw and one and a half inch thick bread and was not seasoned. Separately all pieces were mediocre at best. But for the price, the two stars is for the waiter who was funny. And the food will fill you up but you won't be bragging to your friends about it. I guess coming from the south my expectations are high on quality tasty food. But this place I'd suggest you'd skip."
"5.0","I have wanted to try Delanie's for some time, and I wish I lived closer that I could hang out here all of the time.  When my friend and I got to the door, we thought they were closed because the door was stuck shut.  One of the baristas opened the door for us and apologized.  It was super nice of him, as we were about to just walk away.I ordered the Turtle Latte ($4.50), which was a cold mix of peanut butter, chocolate, caramel, and espresso.  As others have said, this drink is almost like a milkshake but not overpoweringly sweet.  The barista told us this was one of the first drinks he invented when Delanie's started, which was a fun tidbit.  I really enjoyed this drink, and I have never had anything else quite like it.The shop is really big, but a few more tables would be nice.  We did manage to get a seat; however most everyone was sharing tables.  While my own neighborhood favorite coffee place is Commonplace Coffee, Delanie's is definitly one of the best coffee shops in Pittsburgh and easily the best in the South Side."
"5.0","My sister Cyndy was in town on her birthday and my kids Megan & Michael and son's girlfriend Niki surprised her by making reservations at Alexander's Italian Bistro in Bloomfield.  When we got there, our table was ready and we were immediately greeted by Michelle.  From that moment on I knew they had picked the right restaurant.  Michelle was so sweet and attentive.  She explained the menu, helped us make our selections and made us feel like we were in her own home.Michelle started by bring us our drinks and homemade bread which she replenished a second time. It was so good.  Then our meals came. Each one of us ordered something different.  Megan had Classic Chicken Parmigiano, Michael had Penne with Marinara, Meatballs & Hot Sausage, Niki had Chicken Piccata, Cyndy had Penne with Pesto Sauce & I had Angel Hair Pasta with fresh tomatoes, spinach, chicken with splash of white wine.  We all tasted everyones dishes and we couldn't find a winner.  All were so delicious.At the end of the dinner, we all grabbed our to-go bags.  Because we had cake waiting at home, Michelle gave my sister a loaf of their fabulous bread which we enjoy the next day with our coffee.So if you are looking for a great place to eat with fabulous food in a friendly environment.  Alexander's Italian Bistro is your place!"
"5.0","This place has class! We sat in the lounge with a party of 5 (a big table next to the bar) and the room was incredibly clean and a joy to be in. We ordered appetizers which weren't the best, but that was the only negative of the meal. The entrees were wonderful, especially the veal ragu and gnocchi. The bread was also very good, which is made in house (worth the calories). The cherry on top was dessert. I ordered the Nutella mousse but unfortunately the bowl was filled to the brim with whipped cream and almost no mousse. We talked about it among the table and our waiter, Bryan, heard us from a slight distance. He immediately went into action and served us a brand new portion filled with mousse. This is a prime example of how much class and care goes into this place. Would definitely recommend!"
"1.0","This may be a nice place to hang out if it were not for the rather sketchy barista I encountered. I went in for an espresso and was presented with two cups. One was my coffee the other was what I assumed was left-over coffee, a small amount, but in a very nice looking cup. I was told it was 'special'. Ok. I was in a hurry and just grabbed it.On reflection, I decided that I had been mistreated, maybe cheated. Anyway, a couple of days later I go back. The same barista is there. I explain what happened. He's obliging and offers me another coffee. I put a buck down on the counter to show good faith. He 'pulls' a coffee and offers it. It looks like leftovers again (no crema, not very hot). I'm not sure my buck ended up in the cash register.I was not inclined to make a big deal of it (call the manager over, etc) so I just gave up. I won't go there again (there's another quite nice place down the street). And I suggest you avoid this place as well. They don't treat their customers very well."
"5.0","We are a big family with a member in hospice...So it was a big order with some special instructions...We were starving, needed something delivered, found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try...And were glad we did!!The delivery was fast, the order was spot on accurate, and the food was fantastic!!!Most of us had burgers, one fried chicken sandwich, and a couple of hot dogs...Sides were fries, perogies, and side salads...Everything was delicious!!! Not one complaint on the food from 8 people!And that is a miracle with this family...Will definitely stop and eat there in the future!Thank you for making a very hard time a little less horrible!!!"
"5.0","One of my favorite Mt. Wash bars. Bottled beer selection is pretty affordable. Their drafts are usually pricier but worth the money, as they are top-notch.  Guess that song trivoa on Wed is a blast."
"5.0","I love Bruegger's. I'm a member of their 'Bottomless Mug Club' which costs about $150 for the year and entitles me to unlimited free beverages for a year. Many times your receipt includes a survey to get a dollar-off coupon.Prepared bagels and sandwiches are a bit pricey but there are a lot of coupons and promotions available. The 'Last Night's Bagels' are a great deal and if toasted, taste almost fresh."
"1.0","No line management at front door, lack of service, ample angry service. Good food not worth the experience."
"1.0","Two things I asked for when I ordered tacos here: CORN SHELL and JUST CHEESE- no sour cream. The girl taking my order understood but the guy making my order completely disregarded her notes. I got a sour cream-drenched mess in a flour tortilla. Not worth the wait or the price- never again!!!"
"1.0","Visited here twice this year with friends, & I'm not sure what happened...possibly new management? The first visit we had to ask for menus twice. As we were enjoying our German Shepherds (so delicious) & shared jalapeño poppers, the server brought over a basket of chicken tenders & said something that we interpreted as, 'on the house.' So we were confused but excited, but it was way too much food. The server came over later & asked if we ordered the chicken tenders, he mistakenly gave us someone else's order. By that time we had already tried them...so we were charged for them. Needed a doggy bag, had to ask for it twice...I could understand if they were busy, but we were the only ones there.But, yesterday's service was legit awful...we were the only ones there, very exhausted & hadn't eaten all day. Had to ask for menus twice, & we gave it a good 25 minutes, since we were enjoying 2 sample flights. I was the 2nd out of my group of 3 to order & the server behind the bar started walking away after my cheeseburger order...my friend called him back & said he would like to order food too. Our chili cheese fries came with 2 of our orders. By that time a few more people rolled in. Luckily my friend had the chili cheese fries to munch on, because we scarfed down our burger & dog. There were 2 servers behind the bar & when one came out, walking towards the door, my friend got his attention & asked if he could have a cheeseburger. The server admitted he forgot about the order & rushed it. The cheeseburger finally came & my friend scarfed it down & we tallied up & left. Selection-smection. If the customer service isn't your priority, then you're in the wrong business. There are far too many options in Pittsburgh, even on the Mount, for craft beer & bar food. If there's a next time, it'll be a dog & a 6'er to go."
"5.0","Delicious food whether you're strictly veggies or used to eating meat, you won't be disappointed!"
"5.0","I loved this placed! THe vibe is amazing! If you can try to sit on the deck with instagram friendly umbrella decor. I've been here a couple times so I've tried a couple things on the menu. They even made me a smoothie that wasn't on the menu. All in all a nice place to grab a quick bite with cute decor and great service."

"4.0","Mexican food is Mexican.  In my mind it's hard to mess up and hard to be knock your socks off good. So here's why 4- stars.  Drinks were pretty cheap especially given its location in downtown Pittsburgh. You could get a giant marg for like $12, and a very large beer for $5-9.  BUT Here's the really sweet bit.  If you've ever been to Mexico, not your perfect white resort, but I mean real Mexico you know what spicy food really tastes like.  This place definitely has the closest thing to authentic-prep your bum for the next day - spicy that I've had in a while."
"5.0","I hosted a happy hour here with heavy appetizers for thirty folks. Right from the start, planning with Curtis was a dream. He suggested our party take over the whole of the bar and that worked out great for us. Planning a party in Pittsburgh from afar in San Francisco could have been a chore but Curtis put my mind at ease and executed our event with plenty of panache.Food highlights:Crispy fried spare rib? Hell yes!Crispy wings with chili, garlic, parmesan and extra virgin olive oil? Five stars, for sure!Finally, because the little things matter: The bartender prepared for me the most divine sparkling lemonade and it made my night.I'd love to come back here for dinner, and would highly recommend hosting a private event with Curtis and staff."
"3.0","The food was good.  But the one staff personnel was so very unpleasant  and NOT friendly at all.  Asked what kind of bread and we asked for the baked fresh bread that was on the menu and she told us we don't have fresh baked bread.  Asked for soup and her replied that it's not ready, no explanation as to when.  She was just so short and snotty with her answers, did not make the dining experience very good.  Thank goodness the rest of the staff was very nice included the gentleman that put the sandwich together, the young lady that got the drinks, the bartender and the gentleman that ran the cash register.  Just takes one rude staff person to to ruin the experience!"
"4.0","I had been fasting for blood work this morning and reallly needed food. Had a good breakfast that hit my spot."
"4.0","The Yard is great! They have great food and great atmosphere. The beer list is extensive! They have a great selection of craft beers from around the Pittsburgh area. And I feel like they rotate the beers out regularly which is nice. Their food is also awesome! Their gourmet grilled cheeses are like no others! The Mac Attack grilled cheese is like two meals in one! It's a grilled cheese which Mac and cheese on it! Every grilled cheese comes with house made chips and tomatoes soup. I like to substitute fries and dip them in the soup! It's so good! The tomato soup has a thicker consistency than others I've had and it tastes slightly of marinara, which I like. The atmosphere is great! There are a bunch of big, clear TVs for sport watching. Also the bar and tables have a deep wood detail which gives the place a tavern look. It's clean! That's a plus! Overall the yard is a great place for a meal by yourself or with friends!"
"3.0","Went for lunch with my boyfriend, since we both work downtown and like to try different places on our lunch hour. The food was ok. I received a different flatbread than the one i ordered. The one I got was fine, and, good thing, because I didn't have time to wait for another to be cooked for me. When I told the waitress (which I HATE HATE HATE complaining about stuff like this anyway, this is what years of working in food service does to a person), but when I told her, she didn't apologize or anything, she just sort of stared at me. And I still got charged for the item. I thought courtesy would at least mean you get your incorrect item half of, at the very least. That's what a lot of other places do anyway. Just sort of a ho-hum place. Boyfriend ordered a turkey sammy on ciabata bread, and it was nearly all bread. He complained about it being very bland and the turkey not having any flavor. For $25 for two people, we could have eaten at Six Penn, Cafe Amante... both of which have better service and quality of food."
"5.0","My boyfriend and I went to celebrate our anniversary there and it was absolutely perfect! It was our first time being there and the waiters and the hosts welcomed us as if they have known us forever. Our table was adorable with heart confetti and an anniversary card from the Capital Grille team. It was a night that we will never forget and not to mention the food was phenomenal! We will definitely be going back!"
"5.0","I have never had a negative experience here!  The portions are large, and the food prices are very reasonable.  Plus, their staff is great!Drink-wise, their mojitos are delicious!  Whether you are having a relaxed dinner or a night just sitting at the bar, it is a great place to be!"
"5.0","My husband and I last minute decided to come here with our two small boys while in Pittsburgh on a trip. It was seriously one of the best places we ate at while here. It doesn't look like much from the outside until you walk in. Super cute and somewhat eclectic. We were quickly sat and our server was AWESOME! Best service I've had in awhile. She was very friendly and sat down to talk to our oldest. We exchanged stories throughout the evening about our kids. She made sure the kids were always taken care, which is HUGE in my book. I got a sangria and it was delicious! They have a good variety for drinks. We ordered edamame and sushi for apps. It was good! Our dinners... EXCELLENT!!! I highly suggest this place. If I come back to Pittsburgh this is a must!"
"3.0","I am giving B52 a 3 out of 5 for now with high hopes to change to a 4 upon further visits. We stumbled upon this place. It was cozy. They are a vegan bakery and cafe. They have many gluten free options as well. We ordered three apps and 1 small plate. The small plate (eggplant) was my favorite. The apps (hummus, cauliflower and falafel) were all good but nothing to write home about. I am looking forward to coming back and trying an entree or salad!"
"4.0","My boyfriend and I started out our Saturday night by visiting Cinderlands Beer. We reserved a table on opentable and were immediately seated upon arrival. I tried one of their sour beers and my boyfriend had a hoppy beer. Both beers were good but not exceptional. For our meals I had the spicy chicken sandwich and he had the diner burger. The chicken sandwich was very tasty and the diner burger was also good! The prices were a little high for my taste here, but it's always nice to have beers you might not be able to get at other restaurants."
"4.0","Please go this restaurant! We were blown away by the quality and taste of the food. Been wanting to go here for so long, but the location isn't very inviting. However, ignore that fact and just go here! The food is legitimate! We especially like that they have a small menu, which is probably an advantage as they are able to maintain their quality.We started off the the pan fried momos and chicken sadako. Both were amazing!!! The chicken sadako was especially well seasoned, with a very spicy sauce which was to die for. The momos were nicely pan fried without being oily. The sauce complements them really well!For mains, we had the chicken and pork Nepali sets. Both amazing!! Presented beautifully, with all the curries and vegetable varieties complementing each other very nicely! We also ordered aloo paratha to go with our mains, which was perfect! Just like what you get in India! We were extremely pleased with the food here. Service is fuss free, which is not a problem for us as we don't like to be bothered during meals. Really happy and highly recommended. Closest thing we have gotten to India/Nepal in the Pittsburgh area."
"2.0","Unfortunate review. I was really looking forward to dining at Station, but after an evening here with friends I have to say that my expectations must have been set too high for this place. Station is beautiful, the decor is romantic and dark - and this is a great place for a date. However, I have to say that this was some of the most disappointing food that I have had in a long time.It was my friends birthday so we splurged a bit with the tasting menu ($45 which includes a soup, entree, and dessert) All three, fell so short it wasn't even funny. For starters, my friend and I ordered the Chicken liver mousse and the soup, which was served cold. My friend was a fan of the chicken liver, but the soup was probably the worst thing I've ever had. After sitting there staring at the bowl for 20 minutes the bus server came over to clear plates, and when I explained that I really wasn't a fan of the soup (and had hardly put a dent in it) nothing else was said, he just abruptly picked up my full bowl of soup and walked away.For our entrees we had the scallops. The taste was good, the portion was extremely small! We received 3 scallops, three TINY scallops. Needless to say we both left hungry.Final course was dessert, which was relatively good. I didn't feel well so I ordered my dessert to go (popcorn panna cotta) which was again, the smallest portion on the planet. I guess the 'tasting' menu indicates that the portions are prepared in a smaller manner. I guess I just thought that there would be more available, and that the food itself would be more impressive.If I came again, I would like to try their happy hour specials. I wouldn't try the tasting menu again, just because I was so disappointed in it the first time. I'm"
"3.0","I would go back.  The lentil soup was good but needed salt for me to really enjoy.  The lamb kabab was tastier than the lamb adana but was happy with both.  The pickled carrots were great.  Turkish coffee was authentic as it made my head spin.  Liked the outdoor, street-side deck, and the service was courteous.  Nice decor and clean."
"2.0","My wife and I showed up at 5:30 for dinner before a  7:00 movie. We were greeted but then promptly ignored. It went downhill from there. We eventually ordered drinks and food, but the food did not arrive until more than an hour later at around 6:40. By that point I was so annoyed that I asked for the check and the food to go so that we would not miss our show.I am a pretty reasonable guy, but the kitchen was unreasonably slow. I could understand the delay if they were busy, which was the excuse our server threw at us in passing, but the truth is neither she nor the kitchen staff were efficient. There were literally only two other tables when we arrived, a two-top and a six-top. Fortunately, there were two people helping her, or we may never have gotten drink refills.On a more positive note... the food was delicious when I finally ate it at home."
"5.0","Pretty good selection of beer to choose from. Came here for dinner and had no problem getting a table. Large indoor seating, as well as tables out on their patio area.I consider myself very picky when it comes to fries, but these were delicious--I prefer soft over crunchy fries.  Will definitely come back often."
"4.0","Great atmosphere.. Went on a Friday night and they had a live dj playing good hip hop.. The skewers were delicious especially the Wagyu, the karaage fried chicken was to dry but the gravy was delicious.. Def going back but I am gonna stick to tapas next time..."
"3.0","I feel like this place is right out of a Seinfeld episode.  It's in a tiny space on Penn Ave in Lawrenceville.  Tram is a gentleman who doesn't like it if you're not ready to order immediately when he comes to your table.  Because you only get about 2 minutes to look at the menu, the pressure's on when you sit down!The food here is tasty and inexpensive.  The Pho is perfect on a cold winter day.  I'll agree with other reviewers that the spring rolls are delicious as well.It gets pretty crowded during the weekday lunch rush.  Recommended if you're in the neighborhood!"
"3.0","I just want to say this place is mm pretty delicious. I've been here four times and every time my food was on point. I've tried their French toast and their Benedict. They both are out of the world delicious. The only reason I gave them a three stars is THE WAIT. If we get lucky and didn't have to wait for seats, we still have to wait forever for the food. I always give my friends a head up about the wait for food. The first time I came I waited at least thirty mins and had to ask the waitress what's going on. Everytime after that, yup there is indeed always a long wait to get our food. I will come here if I have plenty of time to kill and also if im not too hungry. Otherwise, you might get grumpy like me :-p"
"2.0","By far the hardest bagel to eat- had a great taste but definitely gave my jaw a workout. Also the staff was unpleasant and seemed unamused to be there."
"4.0","Cool vibe.  Cool place with good service.  Tacos are great.  I'd say a notch better than the overrated Tako but a notch below the flavor of Bakersfield.They have beef, veg, chicken, and carnitas as well as a rotating special.  Will be back for sure!  The Cholula crema on top is amazing."
"4.0","Usually a Morton's guy but my son wanted this for his BDay & I hadn't tried them yet....very good food, from apps to dessert we were quite satisfied! A couple notes: the lobster bisque was a bit watery but still tasted great...my filet was more medium well than medium...other than these minor issues the food was great! Now I have to mention the reservation issue...I reserved a table online, received confirmation AND a phone call to confirm...OK, done...when we get to the greeter they didn't have our name?!!?! I was told they had us down for the next day...ok, your fault not mine...they sat us down & everything was fine...I even got a cancellation message for the reservation I didn't make??!! Again, minor stuff for what was a great night out!"
"4.0","FOOD:  Good food.  I wouldn't say its the best I have had.  Recently moved from Brooklyn, NY, and this place reminds me of Park Slope.  Tried the lamb, and was disappointed. The dishes look good, but the meat had a strong game taste.  The other dinner options did look good though.  Appearance of each dish is on point. PRICE:  As expected for this quality of food.  Although would say it's a bit more than what you actually get.  ALCOHOL:  Drinks and beer selection are great.  Tried multiple and was not disappointed.  Prices made me feel like was right back in NYC though. ATMOSPHERE:  Very Hip/Trendy venue. Clean.  Friendly staff. Would return, only after trying other places first."
"2.0","One of the worst Panera experiences I've had. I ordered ahead of time using their iPhone app, and when I arrived the food was not ready even though it was supposed to be, and the staff seemed unsure of how to make the things I had ordered. They were running out of stuff, and had to substitute something else for the avocados, only had one flatbread left, etc. The food itself was pretty blah. I won't be going back unless I'm starving."
"3.0","Sooo let me tell you how we ended up here. We are on a quest to try Pittsburgh's best through the alphabet. We started with places that start with 'A', and go to 'Z.' The only rule is, neither I nor my girlfriend could have eaten there before. Let's just say that there are not a lot of 'Q' restaurants around. Arrive at Quik-It-Chicken. A gas station/ hair salon/ chicken shack hybrid, it actually smells really good inside and even on the car ride home, our take out smelled amazing. The taste was close. I got the Quik Meal- a wing and a leg, with collard greens and a corn muffin.Chicken (on bone)- 3.3/5 The chicken was sitting out a while so I put it in my air fryer for a little bit when I got home which made it better. It tasted fine but could have been seasoned a bit more. I want to try a fresh piece of chicken right out of the fryer. Collard greens- 3.7/5The collard greens are exactly what I expected, cooked right with a kick!Cornbread muffin- 4.6/5But the corn muffin... let me tell you about this fluffy, moist, decadent, corn bread muffin... MMMMMMM! I'd be back just for one of these God's gifts to earth.Chicken tenders- 1.8/5My girlfriend got the chicken fingers which sadly, were poorly breaded and very, very dry. Avoid at all costs. If you're in the area and want some fried chicken, stop in. You'll get your fix. Definitely get a muffin!"
"4.0","I had just finished decorating my Christmas tree and I was looking for something cozy for dinner. BBQ is my absolute favorite, so when I saw it was on GrubHub, I decided to try it out. I recently moved to Manchester and I'm still learning the local establishments. I ordered the ribs, yams/apples, and corn bread. The sauce on the ribs is really good with just the right amount kick and smoke.  They melted in your mouth with just the right amount of char on the end hat reminded me of burnt ends on brisket. The yams were spiced in a way that felt perfect for post-Christmas decorating.  Another reviewer mentioned the cornbread. Yes! Next time I need to try the fried chicken and greens. I like to support my fellow Northside neighbors, so thank you for giving me a late dinner that will have me coming back."
"1.0","I do NOT even want to give this restaurant one star. This restaurant should be closed!!! I bought a groupon last month and went in to use it for a take out order. While I waited in the bar area off of the lobby, I noticed that there were these plug in floral air fresheners. It smelled horrible all around me. Apparently they are attempting to mask the dirty smell that was coming from the carpeted floor and walls around me. Next, I thought that I saw a mouse!! I was not sure so I stood up and went into the well lit Lobby. It smelled in that area also. I decided to go upstairs to the ladies room. The entire way up the disgusting odor was all around. I passed the kitchen area into the filthy bathroom. I didn't use it, I turned around and returned to the Lobby. I paid for my order, gathered it and left. I am not going to say what I did with the food.  Do NOT eat here. ATTENTION STATION SQUARE..... YOU NEED QUALITY RESTAURANTS IN AN AREA THAT MANY TOURISTS VISIT!! This city has an amazing culinary reputation! I can't believe this place is open!"
"5.0","Is always a pleasure to have breakfast here!!! We order the brunch special with a fruit plate, farmers special crepe and a Nutella banana crepe."
"5.0","Loved it! Thoroughly enjoyed my beer, Brussels sprouts, pierogies, and pop tart for dessert. It's like upscale comfort food, yum! Will definitely be back."
"5.0","Lived and Ate in Pittsburgh for the past 4 years. Morcilla, in my opinion, is the best enjoyment to price ratio out of all of the 'finer' dining joints in the city. Great drinks, even better food, at a an extremely fair price."
"4.0","The fried chicken is pretty good. A bit oily and too fatty, but very crispy and the sauce is good. Also you're not likely to get much better for the price, in Pittsburgh at least. Honestly, I'd say that's the main draw of Chick'n Bubbly: the fact that they don't have any real competition for their niche. The boba is okay, not enough tea flavor but acceptable. They used to serve bingsoo that I enjoyed but they've discontinued that now :'("
"5.0","All I really have to say is...this place is AMAZING. Classic ambiance, Delicious food, fantastic service, potent wine and dreamy dessert. The food at the capital grill is well worth the price. I ordered the balsamic wagyu burger. It was heavenly. I decided to have it served medium and this was the perfect choice.  It was so savory and juicy. I also elected to have the truffle oil fries. OH MY GOD. I think they were the best fries I've ever had in my entire life. For dessert, I ordered the cheesecake. The cook fired the top to give it a small crunch. I'm not a huge dessert fan, so I don't think I really appreciated the time it took to create such a beautiful dish, so I'll include a photograph. I don't think I've ever been in a restaurant that has made me want to come back the very next day, so props to the capital grill!"
"4.0","An old coworker had recommended this restaurant as the best Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh so I had to give it a try. My husband and I came here for their lunch buffet, which they offer daily for $9.99. Their buffet doesn't have a huge selection, but it was enough for us. We wanted to get a taste of varying dishes since we're not entirely too familiar with Indian cuisine. The selections had chicken tikka masala, chicken biryani, tandoori chicken, fish curry, mixed vegetables, of course naan and rice, and possibly a few other dishes I might be missing. I was very pleased with the taste of all the dishes. The chicken and fish dishes were not at all dry like we expected of buffet food. They were perfectly moist and the spice was mild. With an affordable price tag and good quality buffet food, we will definitely be back for our next Indian fix!"
"3.0","I have always been a fan of redfin's. Normally great food normally great atmosphere. Last night I took my dad for his birthday and unfortunately it poured on us as we were sitting outside. The restaurant was nice enough to find us a table inside. Ordered some appetizers for our part of five that were great and multiple meals and drinks. I got crab legs and my six year old son was helping me open them. I let him try crab for the first time and our waitress came over and said 'my manager saw you sharing, you can't do that'. It was humiliating and of such bad taste when a child who is in kindergarten is helping open shells for his mom on a $50 meal. Our bill is was $200. I found it insulting, I don't think we'll be back; know your customers he's a kindergartener trying crab not an adult."
"5.0","Awesome location and free parking! They also have a large isolated room that is excellent for studying.  I think this might be the same location as 3401 Blvd of the Allies."
"3.0","'Average' is the best description for Chinatown Inn. A very friendly staff, the take Amex,great cocktails, nice presentation and generous amount of food can usually one one over. However, there was something lacking with flavor in all three dishes.We ordered Shredded Chicken with garlic, General Tsao's beef and Pork Dumplings. All lacked flavor and were somewhat bland. All were hot, came nicely arranged and looked very appetizing. When you took a few bites, it was edible, but I think the presentation raised my expectations prior to taking a bite.Would I go back, probably not. If I lived or was in the area and craved Chinese one night would I go back, probably yes but with much lower expectations."
"5.0","Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Came all the way from Arizona and LOVED this place!  Cheesesteak was incredible!  My husband had the Sicilian and raved. Cheese fries were great!  Wonderful recommendation from Hotel Monaco!"
"5.0","Can you believe this pic was taken in a vegan cafe? It was and it tastes as good as it looks. This vegan burger is made from scratch in weekly batches. Come early since the restaurant has limited seating and the website says they often run out before the end of dinner. This week the kofta burger was topped with Guinness bbq, tobacco onions, cashew cheddar, pickle slaw on a sesame seed bun with a side of za'atar fries and harissa ketchup. The burger was satisfying and delicious. Never knew vegan could taste this good. Will be back soon."
"3.0","I had a friend recommend this place. Can't complain about the parking or seating, it's Bloomfield for crying out loud! The food was take out quality. I loved my noodle and beef bowl with plenty of chili pepper added. ( can't begin to name it, began with a v and is at the bottom of the menu.) but the spring rolls were burnt to a crisp. I'm willing to give them another chance."
"5.0","Half off drinks from 5pm to 7pm and $5 happy hour menu. Need I say more?  Doubles on doubles on doubles on doubles. Mario's is smoke-free and Blue Lou's is smoker friendly, so take your pick. And don't miss out on live Ron Jeremy entertainment on Friday evenings. I spent years and years of my college time running wild here, but now that I'm past that, I like the happy hour crowd/time just as much. This is especially exciting when you've sadly realized that you're too post-grad old for goblet night.If you want local Pittsburgh drunk fun anywhere from 5pm to 2am, this is your spot. And they have the best bartenders who make everything extra strong. Just an FYI though, if you're past 24 and there after 10pm, you'll most likely be the mid-life crisis in the corner."
"4.0","We ate here before the pirate game. The service by George was awesome. The food was good and the drinks were too"
"5.0","Price was fair for being a restaurant with great sushi. The vibe was hip and even saw some interesting 'floor' seating. We definitely would go back to try other things on the menu. Even being a vegetarian I had a ton of options and left feeling full. One thing I enjoyed the most was the different sake options and it was affordable to try two different types."
"5.0","I was amazed at the quality and portion sizes here. they have a fantastic selection of hot foods and friendly employees. The kebabs and falafel are top shelf. to top it all off, the prices are the best for the food you get. You have a new regular customer."
"5.0","wonderful experience from appetizers to main course. our server was pleasant and on top of her game given how busy they were. will return!"
"5.0","Fernando's is a wonderful place to stop in for a bite to eat. The wait staff are quite friendly if you take the time to speak with them, and the food is delicious. We host monthly gatherings at the restaurant with the blessing of the owner and staff, and everyone is excited to come back month after month for another lasagna wrap or sub. I've found their gourmet pizza to be to-die-for. They changed their hours last summer to capture more business, and I think it's only helped them out. It's certainly brought myself and my friends their way more often than during AC every summer."
"5.0","Superb Biriyani! The chef is also very kind and friendly. Is not a stereotypical Indian restaurant with fancy settings. They do provide student discounts and take out. May not be ideal for fine dining but a great gastronomic experience"
"4.0","Stopped by here for lunch today and it was great! The service was excellent, we are lucky we went at an off time and didn't have to wait. Our waitress was really friendly and the food was so good. The bread and soup were great and my pasta with chicken was good too. My only complaint is for the added cost of added chicken there was only a few little shreds of it in my pasta, though it was delicious nonetheless! Nobody saved room for dessert, although I bet it's delish!"
"4.0","I love the create your own salads. You can get as many toppings as you'd like, and they toss it right in front of you. I gave them a 4, because I ordered a grilled cheese and tomato soup once. The soup was cold, so I haven't ordered it again."
"5.0","As we always do whenever we come to Pittsburgh, my family and I stopped in to Bettis Grill. It's our go to spot to eat dinner when we are in town. The food was great, and the service we had from Gabriel was second to none! My water stayed filled even though I was guzzling it like crazy. Never a disappointment when we come here!!! Thanks for the great service Gabriel, it really makes a difference!!"
"1.0","This Chipotle consistently runs out of ingredients, like fajitas and lettuce for example. On top of that, they are often behind on mobile orders during prime meal hours, and it is not uncommon to see a line of mobile orderers still waiting for their meals that were promised ten minutes ago to come out. Today, I picked up my bowl and brought it home, only to find that they did not include the steak I ordered. I am not sure whether they ran out of steak or just forgot to put it in, but there was no note left on the order mentioning that they were unable to provide the protein I had paid for. This is, of course, in addition to my bowl being fajita-less, which has been the case for the past five bowls I've ordered from this Chipotle, despite having selected fajitas on the app each time. From now on, I would rather bus over to Oakland, order from the Chipotle there, and bus all the way back, than have to order from this restaurant again, which is easily walkable from where I live."
"3.0","Located in the first floor of a house (not that I think anyone lives upstairs, but it is possible) Tamarind is a decent Indian buffet for lunch.  The place is a bit cramped but I've never had to wait for a table for lunch. Decent selection of all your go-to Indian cuisines and the price is decent."
"2.0","Based on all the great reviews, I've been wanting to try out this place for quite some time now. I finally stopped in on a Thursday night and I'm sad to say I was extremely disappointed with both my food and my service. Maybe I came here on an off night?My first impression was that the place looked really cool. Each table is given a South Side street name, hence the 'Streets on Carson' and they have a decent selection of beers and cocktails. The food menu also looked really awesome with dishes from 'all around the world' such as muffuletta sandwich from New Orleans or ahi tuna banh mi from Vietnam. I think the concept is great. However, execution was lacking the night of my visit. I ordered the shrimp po boy while my friends ordered pastor tacos and a Cuban sandwich. Of the three meals, only one was decent, which was the Cuban. My shrimp po boy was served on thick, cold, Italian bread. It was drenched in their remoulade and get this, my shrimp wasn't even cooked all the way. Really, it was like eating a mayo sandwich with cold chewy shrimp. Really appetizing, right? My friend's pastor tacos lacked flavor where even a sprinkling of salt didn't help. Service also wasn't that great. Our waitress never once smiled at anyone and just altogether looked and acted miserable. We just didn't feel very welcomed here. I don't think I will ever come back and if I do, I will just stick to drinks."
"5.0","Creative. Delicious. Intimate. With impeccable service. Liked the wine list, too. Would be delighted to come back."
"5.0","Fantastic food, questionable ambience: if it weren't so far away, I'd go all the time for dinner. One caveat: I've only been for dinner; most of the complaining reviews seem to be about the lunch buffet.The plus is that the food is delicious. A few of my friends who generally refuse to eat Indian food will eat here. The Indians I know, who are really not pushovers when it comes to food, love it. I'd recommend the biryanis, and I really like the bhindi masala. Curries are also good.The minuses are what you expect from a place like this, so they really don't count.  Look, you're not going to take Ban Ki Moon here or have your wedding reception here. -Hole in a wall decor-Service is fine, but not amazing"
"4.0","Pretty good breakfast in an unassuming space. I would've walked past it if the group outside weren't eating breakfast. I got the skillet and it was really good. I added feta and mushrooms. Not sure how it is as a bar but for breakfast it was good and cheap."
"5.0","Vegan or not, B52 is a must try! I dragged my steak-loving friend here for lunch and he was surprisingly in love with the food.  It was my first visit and needless to say, I think I'm already obsessed. Definitely one of the best vegan restaurants I've been to in Pittsburgh.I stopped in during the lunch rush. With the small space and limited seating, we would have had a bit of wait, but luckily, there were open spots at the bar. Service was fantastic from start to finish. We were promptly greeted by our waitress who was friendly and helpful throughout the meal - amazing all around!The menu takes middle eastern cuisine and gives it a unique flare. Some items and combos may sound a bit odd, but they surprisingly work. I ordered the koftka tofu scramble which came with wilted kale, eggs, and a seitan/tofu mix. Highly recommend! Not only was it delicious but the portion was huge so you're sure to be satisfied afterwards. The seitan/tofu had the consistency of ground beef and was seasoned very well but not too overpowering. To satisfy my sweet tooth, I had the almond cashew yogurt which was essentially a yogurt parfait. Simple but still delicious.Although vegan food has a bad reputation, B52 definitely raises the bar. This is a great lunch or dinner option for vegans and even non-vegans. If I could come here for every meal, I would be the happiest veghead on the planet."
"1.0","I personally know someone who has seen their kitchen and back room.  I trust this person very, very much and I can safely say without fear of exaggeration to not eat there.  That said, before I found out what I found out, I did eat here and neither the service nor the food was that good.  Sure, the portions were big, but the server forgot to bring a part of our order and the taste was bland and generic."
"4.0","I went for lunch and coffee with a friend based on yelp recommendations.  The coffee was great, the food was very delicious (hummus pita, ginger tofu sandwich), and the decor was awesome.  We sat up in the loft.  However, unlike most reviews I read, the barista/staff were not friendly.  It took me a while to figure out how to describe them, and what I finally realized is that they were snobs.  I think they would have been just as happy had we walked out and went to Brueggers instead."
"1.0","This one star is for service. They have the best salad in town hands down. But there is no way I have to wait 15 min for my salad when I have ordered it online an hour ago. This is the 3rd time that has happened which makes it 3/3 last 3 times."
"4.0","Friendly and quite decent chain bagel outlet with well above average bagels.  Quite tasty.  Nice dining room.  Very attentive and caring staff.Much preferred to the Bagel Factory - the other bagel place in Squirrel Hill.Ultimate East Coast bagel snob compliment - I would eat here even if I were at home (D.C.)!"
"5.0","La Gourmandine is an absolute treasure, and I'm so glad they have a downtown location now. Their almond croissant is the best I've ever had, and their coffee and espresso drinks are great as well. Everything is extremely decently priced, there's free wifi and nice seating, and the people working here are super nice and friendly. Couldn't ask for more!"
"5.0","** Solid brunch place in the strip district with a wide selection of breakfast foods (all day) as well as sandwiches. Blueberry ricotta pancakes are for sure a highlight to check out.This place has been super hyped up to me after hearing my girlfriend and her friends rave about how good the ricotta pancakes were, how they were 'so soft that they melt in your mouth,' and how this place is the 'best breakfast place in Pittsburgh.' Eventually I had to check it out to see if they were just blowing up smoke or this place was legit. After coming here with her to try out their ricotta pancakes, I have to say they were't exaggerating. I ordered the guy's breakfast, which came with a good variety of bacon, eggs, potatoes and the blueberry ricotta pancakes. I love having a variety of different foods to eat in one breakfast plate, with a combination of sweet and savory so to me this place got off to a good start. Everything about the savory foods was just as you'd expect to be, nicely seasoned, warm and tasty. The pancakes were definitely what set Cafe Raymond apart... and no lie my teeth sunk right through the warm pancake immediately upon contact. There were real berries found in the pancake as well, and the pancake tasted fresh, unlike other places where they taste like they have been sitting out for awhile. What I also liked was the fact that the pancake wasn't overly sweet, allowing you to adjust the sweetness to your liking with however much syrup you desire. This is a place I'd definitely come back to if I have the chance!"
"4.0","My favorite Southside coffee shop. Banana chocolate smoothie for the win! The loft is a great place for a quick meeting or an extended work session."
"5.0","Hidden gem in Pittsburgh unexpected delicious treats. We usually eat Vietnamese food in San Jose California and I think it was equal if not better. Owners are a nice friendly and helpful. Both our kids enjoyed the pho and stirfry noodles. The coconut noodles were delicious."
"5.0","Thank you  so much to this placedishes was ridiculously great me and my wife had 'crispy chicken wings' 'Chicken Liver'Mushroom pasta' andof course desert'chocolate mousse 'amazing experience with Station definitely will be back!!!!!!!"
"1.0","Although I had found a good pizzeria on Craig St already (Pizza Prima), I decided to give Little Nipper's a shot. I came into the restaurant on a Friday afternoon and was greeted by the owner. I asked him the dimensions of the Large Pizza, and he couldn't even give me a definitive answer. He just said 12 slices, which gives me absolutely no information about how big it is. I ended up ordering a medium Nipper's Specialty (combination pizza).When I got back home, I was astonished that anyone could actually ruin pizza. The green bell peppers, mushrooms, and onions weren't cut thinly, and as a result, soaked the pizza. The pizza had no flavor because the water diluted all of the salt in the cured meats (pepperoni and bacon). Furthermore, the dough was chewy because they didn't bake it long enough to evaporate the water. Simply put, it was a bad experience.I will never come here again. $15 for a medium mediocre specialty pizza is a joke. I would much rather go to Pizza Prima, which is only half a block away."
"5.0","Hambones is a great bar with great bar food.  Jeff the owner is there often.  friendly as hands on as an owner should be.  The hambones stew is the famous thing to get.  Burgers and apps are good.  The Thursday night comedy show has some good performers.  Like that comedian with the beard and the hair."
"5.0","Okay let me tell you something. When I lived in Shadyside when I was in middle school (around 2002-2004), my mom and I ate a Pamela's religiously. Best. Breakfast. Ever.When I moved back to my hometown Chicago after my 2 year life in Pittsburgh, we tried finding a breakfast place just as good in Chicago. Never happened. It is now 10 years later, nothing better than Pamela's from pittsburghI missed Pamela's so much (and pittsburgh in general, sure), that last summer in 2013 my friends and I drove the 8 hours from Chicago to Pittsburgh just so I can experience Pamela's again.It was just as good as it was 10 years ago - and I told the waitress that myself. We will be making another 1-night trip again this summer. They are hooked.Nothing like Pamelas. Nothing. Oh the memories..."
"5.0","Awesome coffee and tea shop!  Cool environment to work and network in.  Reliable WiFi and good good!  They host live music a couple of times each month too."
"5.0","The corned beef hash here is the best corned beef hash I've ever had. Everytime I visit Pittsburgh, it's a must-eat! The lines can get long so I try to come closer to closing time when the restaurant is less busy."
"5.0","What a weird and wonderful place this is!  Open mics in the aux room, divey in a good way, lovely service personnel, Lawrenceville staple.  Food is delish.  Make and wind your way here and transport yourself to a different world!"
"5.0","Wow this tapas style restaurant is great! We sat at the bar and the bar tender was very friendly and explained the menu to us. The SPANISH MACKEREL ESCABECHE and octopus were amazing! Honestly everything we had was excellent and this place is definitely worth a visit."
"4.0","I can only comment on the pizza and the good service here bcuz I haven't had anything other than the pizza. But I would recommend trying this place out for whatever you'd like. I've picked up a few Uber orders here and actually that's how I found out about this place. Every time I went, the wait was never long, if I waited at all and the staff were always nice to me. The huge slices of pizza are affordable, yummy and filling. The only thing is the box might not fit in your car lol. Not the best review so I'd continue reading from others who have ordered more from this place just to make sure you don't regret ordering something from here. But if you only want pizza, give it a go and get one of their huge slices. You won't be hungry after you eat one of those or two if you can. I heard that they also have a competition if you can eat so many slices you get $500 or something like that. Check it out if you think you can eat it all. I hope this helps a little."
"4.0","I went here with high expectations a few months ago, and I'm happy to say they were mostly surpassed.  I am a former vegetarian with a healthy appreciation for vegan food, so I couldn't wait to try this place.  My meal as a whole was fantastic  The service was a little slow, but I think someone had called out that night, so that may not have been typical.I tried the BUNN O))) as my appetizer.  It was steamed buns/bao with enoki and other ingredients to fill it.  This was the best part of the meal.  As a matter of fact, it was probably the best dish I have tasted in over a year of living in Pittsburgh.I also tried a Killing Yolk vegan deviled egg.  I was surprised at how egglike the texture of it was.  It was a very nice side.My entree was called Headbangers Balls.  It was tofu and lemongrass croquettes served with a slaw and rice.  They were delicious.My least favorite part of the meal was the dessert.  I tried a matcha tiramisu called Terrormisu.  The taste was enjoyable, as I am a fan of matcha, but the texture was almost jellylike and not like a tiramisu using actual dairy would be.  I understand the difficulty of making these sorts of dishes vegan, but I have had dishes at other vegan places that managed to pull off a creamier texture without using dairy products.Overall, Onion Maiden has a cool ambiance and fun theme.  Although I had a bit of a wait to get my order taken and get my food, what I ate was worth that wait."
"5.0","I live up the street and was so excited to hear about a new restaurant opening. Streets on Carson blew away all of my expectations. The service was great and our waiter Nicholas was incredibly knowledgable about the entire menu. The food was incredible and I savored every bite. The restaurant concept is street food across the country which is so unique to Pittsburgh. This is a Southside must."
"2.0","Over-priced and mediocre. I had the pear appetizer, which was lacking in any discernible flavor, and a green salad which I swear had those same onions in a can you use for green bean casserole at Thanksgiving. The service was stupid and even though I said I was a vegetarian, they did not volunteer that the peppers that came with my bread were cooked in pork fat till I asked what they were (why did they bring those to a vegetarian at all?). I had a delicious cocktail to start the meal, which is responsible for one of the two stars I am awarding Mezzo."
"5.0","My friends and I came here after a long night of drinking and dancing. Their pizza slices were huge (like the size of two pieces of pizza) and delicious. They were super friendly and gave us each a side of ranch. Hurrah for Benny's!"
"1.0","I was here for the Thursday night football game with the steelers and ravens.  First I waited about 15 minutes to get someone to even come and greet me at my table.  After that I ordered and had onion rings.  Let's just say burger king puts more effort into their onion rings.Then came the burger with with which I was impressed with till I took a bite and burnt.  It was medium well in the middle as I reauested and burnt on top mot acceptable.  I saw my server a total of 3 times never asked how the food was and didn't see any managers.  Save your money and eat somewhere else or I guess come on a better night.  I'll never be back again and it was my first time here.  Finally I'm here to watch the steelers game why would you give me the check as I planned to stay here the whole game and drink.  Poor service!!!"
"4.0","Cocktails from Yuzu Kitchen were tasty and tarty. It had a good balance with just the right amount of liquor and juices. Bartender gets two thumbs up. Chicken lettuce wraps were a great starter. Nice light appetizer that is packed with flavor.  My husband and I shared a Seafood Feast that we were both satisfied with. Lobster, shrimp and squid were fried with tempura and mixed with bell peppers and chili peppers. Definitely had a kick to it so if you can't handle heat, I would request to change the spice level.  I loved the decor and atmosphere.  A very nice place for a date night in the Pittsburgh area."
"5.0","Great food and great service! Best veg ramen I've had anywhere!As a vegetarian, it's really hard to find good ramen. Most places that even make one just have some boring veggies in a very bland broth. I got the curry ramen and it was incredible! The broth was rich and flavorful, and all the veggies were great as well. The noodles were also top notch-- nice and chewy and firm."
"5.0","The food is great, in addition to what was already mentioned, I was blown away by chicken wings. The design of place is very cozy. The drinks were tasty except red sangria, which did not have much flavor"
"1.0","straight d*ck team. only reason they did not receive one star is well one, that is not an option, and two, the delivery was quick. (im only 6 blocks down the street though.) got the grilled chicken salad which was 90% fries and cheese. got about 3 bite sized pieces of chicken and maybe 4 bites of lettuce. the pizza was absolutely just sub par. my stomach has been killing me for almost two days. wow."
"3.0","I've been to this place 2 or 3 times. I want to like it but I'm always disappointed. The service sucks, especially at the end of the day. They close up well before closing hours. If you try to order something they are 'all out' or will just direct you to the pre-prepared items. Their dressings are bland and too oily. I've had to bring a salad home to add lemon juice, just to cut the overwhelming abundance of oil with which my salad was dressed. Yuck."
"3.0","Smoked meats are the star here. For the entrees the chefs try to get too creative without a grasp for the ingredients. Dishes lack proper technique, risotto undercooked, peaches weren't caramelized, shrimp over cooked, the lemon tart is over cooked on the custard and undercooked on the pastry. Very disappointing overall, would go again only for charcuterie and drinks but nothing more"
"5.0","Came here to meet a friend for coffee. She had a specialty latte and I enjoyed a traditional latte. We both really enjoyed our drinks and loved the atmosphere here. The customer service we experienced and saw with other customers was phenomenal. Truly, the woman working could not have been kinder or more patient with the customers she had. We had a really great time here and can't wait to come back to try their food next time. Their lunch items sound delicious! This is truly a new gem in Bloomfield!"
"5.0","So I didn't know what to expect going to this place because I'm not much of a fine diner. But every year for Christmas, my family chooses a nice restaurant to simply eat, drink, and enjoy each other's company during the hectic holidays. My dad had a gift card for Ruth's from when he retired almost 3 years ago, and said he was saving it for a time we could all go. Well, this Christmas was it!We were seated promptly at our reservation time and all ordered drinks and cocktails. As I opened the menu, the prices were about what I expected based upon what I've heard. Now I like a good steak, but I can also say I feel like I've never really had a bad steak out, so I'm not too picky. I was wondering to myself if paying triple what I'd typically pay for a steak was going to make a difference to me taste-wise, but I was blown away when mine came. I got the 6 oz filet cooked medium with shrimp. I've never eaten a steak without steak sauce or mushrooms or onions, something to add more flavor. This steak was so. Damn. Flavorful. It's obviously a combination of the cooking it in a thousand some degree oven, as the waitress explained to us, and the mass amounts of butter that I'm sure was applied and soaked in  during different times of cooking. Wow. The smell alone was amazing as it wafted around our table. They should make a candle! (That would actually be weird and you'd be salivating at random in your home. ) Every bite was so melt in your mouth good I really couldn't believe it. Nearly everyone at our table got the Ruth's Chris classic meals, which were priced for either $48 or $55 depending what you got. They all came with either a soup or salad, one side, and dessert. I was really surprised to see these options on the menu, because we were preparing to spend almost double a person of we all ordered a steak and side. This was a great choice to try a little bit of everything on the menu without going overboard in the money department. I got broccolini as my side, with a salad beforehand and the dessert was a mini apple cheesecake tart with ice cream. I really can't express enough how delicious it all was, but especially that perfectly cooked filet. The staff was great and very attentive while also answering all of our questions since we'd never dined there before. Definitely a great place to go for a special occasion in the future."
"4.0","My favorite breakfast spot downtown. It's a shame it's only open on weekdays. When ordering breakfast, make sure you order the potatoes because they are amazing. Nothing on the breakfast menu has let me down. The lunch menu isn't bad either, but lunch items don't taste quite as homemade. For instance, the burger tastes kind of like a frozen patty. And the customer service could improve: the cashier usually isn't that nice. The breakfast may be enough to overcome the unfriendly service, though!"
"5.0","I go weekly and the food is incredible. The staff are not the best with English, but they are friendly and they like to make conversation. The place is small and you might miss it if you're not searching, but it's easily the best Indian food in the area."
"5.0","We went for restaurant week. We are Morton's regulars and trying out other steak houses. We're pleased with RC. Paula was our server and was very good at pacing our dinner and wine to our liking. Bread was a simple Breadworks baguette. Salads were smaller but sufficient. The sides to share were large and very good. The filet and salmon were both very good. I eat slow and my filet kept cooking on the sizzling plate so I would order a little less done than normal. Wine prices are high but not too bad for a steak house. Free parking a nice plus and they have a nice outdoor eating patio. Will return."
"5.0","HUGE beer selection! Killer vibe. Staff and service on point.  Every food item I tasted was fantastic. Great for happy hour!"
"4.0","Really nice food and quite a variety of selections available. It's perfect for lunch during a busy working day in downtown Pittsburgh. Cozy atmosphere with small tables for a quick lunch with co-workers."
"1.0","Preface: I am in the service industry myself. If you give me even average service, I will at least tip 25-30%. City Works is a fantastic place IF you like to play hide and seek with your waitress. If you want food, or even a beer in less than 30 minutes, you should look else where.We sat down in the outside area on a Sunday. Including us, there were probably 20 people total in the entire restaurant. After 10 minutes, a waitress appeared. We asked a simple question about an appetizer, which overwhelmed her. We gave her the benefit of the doubt, and just ordered a beer. A simple draft beer. Twenty five min passed.I walked indoors, asking if anyone could get us water, beer, whatever. Embarrassed, the hostess said she'll send her right back out.Five more minutes passed (we were her only table).We calmly got up, and left. Summary? Maybe this place has good food? Possible, but we never got past getting poured a glass of water, much less a beer. We went across to diamond grill, ate, drank, and paid my bill before that waitress ever came back lol. ::Facepalm:: Just don't even come here. Don't."
"5.0","Multiple people have recommended B52, and I finally made my way there this morning.  Worried about a wait, we arrived shortly after opening and were seated immediately.  The space is cute, and small. I appreciate the small barriers which gave some privacy and sound restriction. The fried cauliflower was delicious,  as were the almond milk lattes.  We ordered the two versions of the tofu scramble. YUM. I couldn't help eyeing up the pancakes from a nearby table. Our waitress was attentive and lovely.  I appreciated how how frequently she refilled water, expressed when bringing the check that she could split it however we liked, and when I asked for a to-go cup for my dipping sauce she brought me a full fresh new cup. They appear to post frequently on their FB page and am looking forward to trying out their dinner menu."
"5.0","best pizza in south side. huge drink selection. awesome atmosphere. $4 for a slice that could easily feed 2 people!"
"1.0","Sat for 15 minutes on a SUNDAY and never had anyone greet my party or acknowledge we existed. Can't comment on the food or drinks because we left after waiting for so long. Would never return or suggest anyone dining here."
"2.0","If they are famous for being run down with poor service, then they have succeeded. The service is very unfriendly. They make you feel like you are inconveniencing them by being there.The corned beef sandwich was just mediocre...nothing special. I won't be returning"
"4.0","Visited this restaurant for the second time since right after the opening.  My rating is still 4 stars.   We visited on a Sunday at lunch time.  Parking wasn't too bad -off street.   I decided to build my own burger and was pleased.  I love that the restaurant offers Red Ribbon beverages!!!    Coke in a bottle is also an option which is great because we were able to take it with it when we departed!!   My boyfriend ordered the fried chicken sandwich and was raving about it. He's a picky eater so it was certainly good.  I liked the fries.. they were a bit on the salty side but still good.   We will be returning.  Thanks Burgh'ers Brewing!"
"5.0","This was a wonderful Italian restaurant, cozy, warm and comfortable on a rainy Pittsburgh fall night. We were in Pittsburgh for parents weekend and worried that all of the restaurants would be booked and overwhelmed. We were pleasantly surprised to get a 6:15 Friday night reservation for just 3 people (open table is great). We were seated immediately. Our server was very knowledgeable and had wonderful suggestions. Drinks & warm bread arrived promptly. We began with their signature mozzarella--yummy! I had a shaved brussel sprout salad that had different cheeses and cashews with a light dressing and a half order of gnocchi--melt in your mouth, so light. Our son had an incredible sausage pizza--I know because I had a slice. My husband had the sausage, meatball , beef entree but realized it did not come with pasta , so he added a half portion of spicy spaghetti-- perfect combo for a hungry dad that just drove 5 hrs. Parents weekend got off to a delicious start!"
"5.0","Always enjoyed this place. Good hotdogs with various toppings. Huge beer selection!!! Really, really nice staff! Is it a bar? Is it a restaurant? Is it a beer-to-go place? Is it all three? Yes, and it is awesome!!!!"
"5.0","This restaurant is one of the places that has put Pittsburgh on the map when it comes to world class cuisine. It is as good as it gets and you will not be disappointed. Take the time to talk to your server about the food and the preparations and you will see how amazing the process is. They will also not lead you astray with recommendations. We liked it so much we even got a chance to talk to the owner, who was very gracious and sent our regards to the chef. Make reservations a head of time! I have also been told they have a great happy hour special!"
"1.0","Came here for the first time, wanting crab legs. The wait was over an hour which wouldn't have been so bad, if it wasn't for the DOGS taking up seats at the bar. Yes! People sit their dogs at the bar, consuming seats for paying, waiting customers!!! Oh and if you happen to be the unfortunate soul to sit next to them, make sure no drool or fur gets into your butter! Absolutely disgusted and outraged that they allow this... how can the bar tenders allow this... that's tip money they aren't making! That's food and drinks they aren't selling... terrible!!!"
"3.0","My husband and I went for restaurant week. Reasonably priced, byob and the corking fee was included with the restaurant week package. The atmosphere was cozy, even though the inside is small it wasn't too crammed. Staff was friendly and service was pretty good.Creative food choices, I loved the pumpkin ravioli and loved that they make their own salad dressings. We had quinoa meat balls as an app and they took some aclimating to but they were pretty awesome and ended up being the main thing I remember. Definitely a good place to spend diner with friends, I plan on returning to try more of the menu"
"5.0","A family favorite for years. I get a plain steak with tomato, lettuce, and mayo. And of course fries - gotta put the Malt on top too.It's very much a dive, but that's what makes it great. The history, the people. WHen it's busy be patient, it's well worth it. Cash only."
"2.0","The service was so bad  i almost walked out. Two young girls were on a computer didn't say hi just stood there at the counter and waited for us to order. They had a miserable demeanor and kept saying to one another 'i can't wait to leave ' this is annoying to me as a customer and not professional. I will not go back if the two miserable girls are working. Food was good. They need to hire less whiney unappreciative people."
"2.0","Way too comfortable, way too early. My first time here was just annoying and really made me feel unwelcome. I ordered something and I didn't like it (mashed plantains that were merchandised as fried plantains GROSS. The bartender christian never asked if I wanted to try to something else. Just uncomfortable brushed past me as if I was 'suppose' to pay him."
"5.0","I tried B52 tonight for the first time and think I'm in love. I will be dreaming of their baba ganoush. Hands down the best I've ever had. I got a falafel wrap and my partner got the kabob, and both were really delicious. Can't wait to go back!"
"1.0","Customer service is terrible. My food was cold all three time I went including the opening week."
"5.0","Who knew a food truck could be so good! The pricing is wonderful and India on Wheels is the perfect lunch stop. I haven't had better Indian anywhere in Pittsburgh."
"5.0","The best Thai food I've had in Pittsburgh.  It's always the little hole in the wall places that have the best food!  The staff were great, serivce was very fast.  We got Pad Thai, Pineapple yellow curry fried rice, red curry and green curry, all of which were AMAZING.  I used to go to Thai Cuisine, but I like this place much better.  Can't wait to go back!  Also BYOB with no corking fee...can it get better?!"
"1.0","Should a customer have to wait an hour for (mediocre) food? And within that hour no apology for the delay? And not proactively be offered a price comp for inconvenience? Should that customer then be made to feel bad for spending too much time in a restaurant (hmm i wonder if that would be attributable to an hour wait for food?) And then be told to leave for not wanting to pay for her meal? These questions remain unanswered by Caffe Mona management after my dining experience this weekend. Unfortunately the good vibes of a post yoga workout meal  and opportunity to catch up with friends visiting from out of town for homecoming weekend was tarnished by lack of quality customer service. Instead of admitting to a mistake or apologizing for a delay, my sister was repeatedly told 'your food will be right out' - i would guess 3-4 times over the course of an hour. Meanwhile management monitored the back kitchen while watching a football (US American Soccer) game on TV and only came out to see why some of our orders were mixed up and perhaps figure out why we were sitting around with mostly empty plates - well all but one of us that is - since finally after an hour WE had to inform him one of us had still be waiting to be served.Fast forward a day later - the same group convenes at Gipettos in Lawrenceville for great food, great vibes, awesome service (with an apology for an insignificant 'delay' in some of the food).Long story short - Caffe Mona is not worth it."
"3.0","I went to City Works with a few friends for a late lunch over the holidays. It wasn't hard for us to get a seat - it's honestly so spacious inside! The menu and beer list had something for everyone, which was great for our group! I had a Carolina fried chicken sandwich. It was ok, but it wasn't anything to write home about. It also kind of tasted like it was sitting in the window for a little longer than it should have. Everyone else got burgers and seemed to enjoy their meal, so next time I would probably go that route. Our server was very friendly and helpful when we had questions, and really took the time to chat. There was an awkward exchange where he counted the money at our table to make change, and I felt weird about it. I said that I felt weird out loud, and he responded really well to it and we all laughed. Which was kind of nice. hahaha All in all, this place has a sweet beer list, and it's a great location if you are downtown exploring the city. The food was only decent, so that made my rating drop. I wouldn't write this place off though!"
"5.0","Delicious and fresh. The appetizer platter is enough to share amongst your company. The bread is fresh baked and served warm. All of the flavors were very delicious. The pint of orange juice for five dollars is fresh squeezed and worth the wait. There is out side seating on a patio. I would come back, it was that good."
"4.0","For parents weekend, we wanted to find a place to take our students and some of her friends that was not near campus and wouldn't break the bank.  We decided on La Feria.  Although we had the address, it wasn't easy to find.  We didn't realize that it was upstairs from the Pamela's in Shadyside and when Pamela's was closed, it looked like the entire building was closed.  Apparently others had a similar hard time finding it or thought it was closed because it was mostly empty when we got there.We're glad we tried the door.  The staff was wonderful and offered their suggestions after listening to us.  When taking orders, they noted items on the food that not everyone liked and confirmed whether each person wanted those items or not.  When the food came, it was hot and flavorful (although the garlic rice could have been a little more garlicky).On our walk back to the car, we passed some friends waiting in line at another restaurant and point them back to La Feria."
"3.0","Came here in the evening prior to a symphony performance - it's just down the street from Heinz Hall.It was...okay. Buffet for me, and the food was passable, although it had obviously been out for a while. My young son ordered off the menu, and his food was okay, in his regard. The restaurant seemed clean enough, although for some reason two pairs of tennis shoes were on the floor at the end of our aisle - wonder who owned those?Good enough...my son wanted to try Indian cuisine, and so now he has. Might stop in again, might not."
"1.0","Though I don't hate the pizza, it isn't my favorite. Papa johns had closed already so we just settled. I downloaded the app and ordered around 11pm. At around 11:30 it said it was out for delivery. Long story short it got here around 2am which is crazy. It was a Monday night!  You can't tell me it was that busy. My fiancé called them four times. Two times she was put on hold and forgotten about and another she was flat out hung up on. We will never order from here again. Have some pride in your work and be as hospitable as possible folks or you're going to lose business like crazy. Should have just gotten pizza today instead. Very disappointing"
"3.0","Excellent wait staff with a big variety of beers to choose from. Came her for a lunch with a friend.  Started with fire cracker chicken rolls. It was a little too spicy the avocado sauce did cool it down. Also the plate came out greasy. I had the southern fried chicken sandwich, with side salad with the ginger and seaseme dressing. Side salad was a small, the dressing made that salad good. It was decent, kind of nothing special. I could get that sanwhich anywhere. Like a chick fil a .The beer selection is the only thing that stands out."
"2.0","Call me old fashioned, but if I walk into an establishment I expect to have my presence acknowledged. In my opinion standing within eyesight of 4 employees and being ignored, sets a  bad tone. If you would like guests to seat themselves, post a sign. If not, a simple 'Hey someone will be right with you', would go a long way. I should have turned around then, instead my husband and I sat ourselves only to be scolded and then allowed to remain seated. The service that followed was no surprise. I waited so long for the check that I half considered sending my husband to walk down to the ATM to pick up cash just to leave on the table. The food was mediocre at best. The only part either of us enjoyed were the classic mimosas. No part of the meal would be worth a return trip."
"5.0","The sign outside said 'try and old fashioned at The Summit'.  I did and it was fantastic.  This is my 'go to' cocktail and theirs is as good as I've had.  Too bad we'd already had dinner because there were a bunch of things on the menu I wanted to try.  Can't wait to come back!"
"5.0","I live half a block away from Ki Ramen.  When I first saw they were opening a ramen place in the neighborhood, I almost passed out from excitement.  I LOVE ramen.  This place has far exceeded my expectations.  Their menu is seasonal.  Everything is fresh.  Typically, they have a rotating bao bun, but during the winter months they switch to having the same few selections all the time.  That being said, the General Tso Tofu Bao is wonderful.  During the summer, they had a chilled ramen that was so good I think I got it at least once a week! The inferno ramen is super spicy and great for cold winter months.  Their menu accommodates vegetarians and meat eaters alike. I really enjoy the Take It Easy bar in the back.  In the summer months they open up the garage door and you can sit to watch traffic.  It's right next to a decently busy intersection, so you get some good entertainment."
"1.0","The food is very good but the customer service is abhorrent. I had placed an order for a party tray to feed an office party and I guess the staff didn't expect me to be fluent in Spanish as I got to listen to them swear and call me horrible names because I asked for something on the side. It disgusting and offensive. I will never go to this place again. Pittsburgh has many other Mexican places that will take my money and not call me names to face thinking that I wouldn't understand them"
"5.0","Bobby and Nicole are amazing. The food was wonderful, the service was perfect. Go here, you won't regret it. City works is the way to go."
"4.0","Happy to find a healthy option in Pittsburgh during our trip. Navigating the gluten-free, vegan leaning thing is hard enough (egg and dairy allergies the main reason to seek vegan fare as shortcut) but didn't think finding a good salad would be challenging. Thank goodness for Earth! We ate here two times in two days, me building my own salad both times, hubby did the Thai menu option day one then built his own day 2. Took our salads to the Pirates game day 2 after finding no healthy options in park that I could eat (or were too pricey or not my taste). Very good. Appreciated the diverse options like brussel sprouts, blue cheese, garbanzo beans, carrots, sliced almonds, sunflower seeds, meats, different lettuce mix bases, many dressings, etc. Service is fast."
"4.0","I had the salmon taco and the Korean BBQ as part of a special where I received a free meal for test-driving a Ford car, so I can't comment on pricing. As for the tacos themselves, the salmon came out a bit dry, with very little taste, although I might have chanced onto a dud. On the other hand, the Korean BBQ taco was delicious, juicy and full of flavor, so it all sort of balanced out. The staff I interacted with were friendly and cheerful."
"4.0","This is the first time I have been to a restaurant like this.The menu is based around what is in season, the meat & cheese board is a sampler of food experiments by the chefs and what is available, and the staff waits on you like you are royalty. At least for your first visit, you must get the meat & cheese charcuterie board (or cheese only if you are vegetarian). This, more than anything else on the menu, showcases the creativity and originality that these chefs are putting in every single day to make this place the success that it is! My board had a pate made of beef knuckle and mustard seeds, cured ducked breast, a sheeps milk cheese with an espresso rind, a raging bleu cheese, and a 'loaded baked potato bread', beef-and-berry jam, among several others. The arugula salad with fingerling potatoes as a side dish was exceptional, as well as the port meatballs (although they are much more dense than the meatballs downstairs!) The pizza with pepperoncinis has an excellent crust, tangy cheese, and delicious peppers. However, the peppers are the hottest peppers I have ever had, and the menu gives you no clues that you will need to fill up your water glass several times to get through it!For my birthday, they also served us a complimentary glass of champagne which capped off the night beautifully.In my opinion, this isn't a place to grab drinks with friends or a quick bite on a weekend; that is more downstairs or at the biergarten upstairs. However, if you want a romantic, new food adventure, check this place out!!"
"4.0","Capital Grille is consistently very good. It's this consistency that brings me back. I've dined at many Capital Grilles in different cities, and they never let me down. The steaks are top notch and always cooked to proper temperature. Medium is pink in the center, as expected. The meat always arrives very hot, as if it's straight off the grille (out, hot from the oven), which I really appreciate. Sides are typical of a high-end steak house: potatoes several ways, some green vegetables, all served with enough for 2-3 to share.  Table bread is very good; don't miss the brown raisin bread, it's excellent. Salads and deserts are also pretty standard fare for a good, old-school steak house. The wine list is vast. But the SERVICE is impeccable. Servers are professional but warm, and they know all the specials and all the menu items. There are others who keep the drinks filled frequently. So, yes, I highly recommend this Capital Grille location. One final tip:  just valet park. You won't find anything better."

I had the Kung Pao chicken and the Szechuan chicken lunch specials (both $7.44 with tax), once with the hot and sour soup and once with an egg roll (getting two reviews here). Pittsburgh has crappy Chinese food, but this is the best place that I have come across so far (I've tried about 4-5 other places now). It does mainly cater to American's in regards to taste, but the two dishes that I tried were, in fact, pretty tasty. You will have to order the dishes extra spicy if you like spicy food, because the little chili pepper is not saying much. Now the lunch specials are a great deal: The portions aren't exactly generous, but it's about the same that you would get at a Chinese fast food place for about the same price, but with higher quality.The kung pao dish was loaded with water chestnuts and mushrooms (apparently I am the only person on earth that hates these two things), and had a hearty supply of peanuts. The S-chicken had baby corn, bell peppers and broccoli. On both occasions the fried rice was nice and moist. The hot and sour soup was on par with some of the best I've ever had and the (American) egg roll may have been the best egg roll I have ever had. The second time I came here I had to wait 20 minutes in a line out the door, so be warned about this possibility. Two nice touches about this place is the service and the decor. Most Chinese places throw service out the window but this place does not. They aren't big English speakers, but they stop by a few times to make sure your beverage is topped off. The interior is very pleasant with dark red painted walls and nice pieces of soft art.I plan on eating here more in the future.Food Quality/Taste = 3.5 StarsPortion Size Given Price = 3 StarsPrice = 4 StarsService = 4 StarsExperience with Staff = 3 StarsDecor = 4 Stars"
"5.0","Love this place!  They offer choice of tapioca OR jelly OR bursting pearls!!!  Friendly service and great value for the size- Large is massive (maybe 20 oz)-  for $4.05!   I've paid more than that for lesser quality and half the size!"
"5.0","Easy stuff first - decor is really cool.  Yes, the fish on the wall are real.  The paintings are awesome.  Yes, that's Luke's dad on a lobster phone (though experiencing the real deal in person is even more interesting).  The sushi there is excellent.  The individual pieces may be slightly smaller than the Slippery Mermaid's, but the quality is second to none.  The fish is fresh, tasty, and high quality - and for a very reasonable price.  Lobster bisque fries are similar to gravy fries but with lobster chunks, and if you splurge the extra dollar (and why wouldn't you), bacon bits.  Catfish bites are excellent - and ask for sriracha to add to the dipping sauce to make it the way they originally came when he first opened.  Definitely awesome & spicy.  Mahi Mahi tacos are another excellent appetizer.  As for the cocktails - good gravy in the navy!  The ginger mule is excellent.  So is the Snozzberry.  That said - the Bloody Mary is hands down the best drink available here - and possibly the best Bloody Mary I've had in Pittsburgh.  Spend the $3 and add the candied bacon.  It's absolutely, positively worth it.  You have to have this Bloody Mary.  That's all there is to it.  If for no other reason, go there and have this Bloody Mary.  Seriously."
"4.0","As somebody who knows nothing of Hungarian food, this place was a real delight. The staff are very helpful in explaining the various dishes they offer. I went with one of the owners favorites Hagymás Rostélyos which was a great steak dish. My wife had the chicken paprikas which she didn't like but I thought was good. They have a decent beer selection. Overall a nice place to try something new and authentic in the north side."
"5.0","Heard lots of good things about Ki Ramen, finally went to lunch and it was the best ramen I've ever had! Loved that you could almost 'build your own bowl' with all the substitutions, everything tasted amazing! Cocktail was great aswell!"

"5.0","Josh is back. He makes the best Turkish food ever. It is fresh, healthy and tastes so good. I always get the lamb or chicken with salad and sides. You have to try the sides he makes fresh. You will not leave hungry and your wallet will not get hit hard. Love this place, my go to place a few times a week."
"1.0","Food was AWFUL. Service was poor but we believe it's largely due to being understaffed on the floor.  Party of 4 and all of our meats were overcooked and some were inedible."
"5.0","I ordered the breadbasket and ch tikka masala it was tasty and also ordered ch saag and samosas it was very tasty so coming back to eat there again and the place looked  very nice to sit and eat in so we did"
"1.0","ABSOLUTELY UNHYGENIC & IRRESPONSIBLE!! Im giving them 1 star because u cannot give 0stars.. Its the WORST place to have food. I had hair in my food and when i complained the waiter said 'so many people have taken food from the buffet so we dont know whose hair it is.' He blamed other customers very comfortably. The attitude is worst and he said.. sir we cannot help. PLEASE DONT GO HERE!!!"
"1.0","I'll be blunt with this review: I absolutely cannot stand this Domino's. I don't even mean in terms of the pizza itself. Sure, the pizza isn't exactly GREAT, but I don't think it's particularly bad either. Not fabulous, but ok enough for someone like me.So with that in mind, my problem with this location has relatively little to do with their pizza and everything to do with my office's universal experiences as customers. Firstly, every month, my coworkers and I order from them for a monthly work event, and almost every time we call they insist that we're outside of their delivery range. When this happens we have to tell them that they do in fact deliver to us on a regular basis, and that we're located fairly close to them.Then yesterday, after happily skipping this usual discussion our office was shocked to find ourselves waiting for over TWO HOURS for our pizzas to arrive. We don't expect things to get to us immediately after ordering, which is why we've always called in a while before lunch to place our order each month, but over two hours?! And each time we called they'd just tell us that it was on its way and it would be there soon.When the pizza finally did arrive some poor woman told us she wasn't even working that day and they called her in. I felt bad for her, but then found myself feeling dumbfounded when she asked us at the front of our building, 'Do you need me to bring these pizzas up to your office?' Well, yes - considering how hot the boxes were, how many we ordered, and the fact that we needed the Dominos delivery bag to take care of these issues...I don't think we were even comped in any way for the trouble we went through, either (and believe me, we called to complain. Repeatedly.). I say don't order from these guys unless you really, really have too. Like I said, I love me some pizza, even when it isn't fabulous pizza - but when your service lacks this much, even my patience will reach its limits."
"5.0","Always top notch service and food at Ruth's Chris Pittsburgh. They have some summery specials during these cold winter months to bring you out of the post-holiday funk, which is very refreshing to see. Stop in for lunch for great deals on amazing food. Their lunch cuts of beef, chicken and fish include 2 sides and a salad for an extremely reasonable price. I got the lunch petite filet, veggies, mashed potatoes and appetizer salad for 28 bucks! Not bad for a steakhouse. Our server was incredible, as usual, and was extremely attentive of my gluten-free needs. The servers are extremely knowledgeable of the menu and will accommodate you no matter what. The decor is a bit dated and is due for a remodeling, but perhaps that will be on the list of things to do for the chain since they are celebrating their 25th anniversary this year!"
"5.0","When I first walked into B52, I noticed the drop ceiling with reclaimed tin ceiling tiles and open brick walls. The layout and color palette was relaxing and quaint. The 32 seat cafe includes a full service coffee and espresso bar, as well as, small bakery and take out section. While waiting for a table, my mouth watered over the fresh baked goods including vegan cinnamon rolls, brownies, truffles, cookies, and more!The menu has a Mediterranean theme, but it also includes some general vegan staples such as tofu scramble and buckwheat pancakes. The best part about the menu is that everything is made in house and prepared fresh! The kofta tofu scramble is a MUST try for brunch!Don't hesitate to head to B52 for your next vegan meal!

"1.0","Not real Italian. When there's a crab dish on the menu and you don't let your customers know this there's a problem. Imitation crab meat at an Italian restaurant doesn't fly. I was hoping for some good Italian while out of town and was truly disappointed. The bar service was extremely friendly about my compliant and did remove that dish from my bill. My entree was pasta and shrimp. I haven't paid $20 for a dish of pasta and 5 large shrimp in a long time. Don't worry but I won't come close to this restaurant again."
