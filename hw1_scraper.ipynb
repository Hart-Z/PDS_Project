    "* Custom Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "For the NYT example, since it is a publicly visible page we did not need to authenticate. HTTP basic authentication isn't too common for consumer sites/applications that have the concept of user accounts (like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.) but is simple to setup quickly and you often encounter it on with individual password protected pages/sites. I'm sure you have seen this before somewhere:\n",
    "\n",
    "![http-basic](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QnUZW.png)\n",

    "Cookie based user login is what the majority of services use when you login with a browser (i.e. username and password). Once you sign in to a service like Facebook, the response stores a cookie in your browser to remember that you have logged in (HTTP is stateless). Each subsequent request to the same domain (i.e. any page on `facebook.com`) also sends the cookie that contains the authentication information to remind Facebook's servers that you have already logged in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many REST APIs however use OAuth (authentication using tokens) which can be thought of a programmatic way to \"login\" _another_ user. Using tokens, a user (or application) only needs to send the login credentials once in the initial authentication and as a response from the server gets a special signed token. This signed token is then sent in future requests to the server (in place of the user credentials).\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar concept common used by many APIs is to assign API Keys to each client that needs access to server resources. The client must then pass the API Key along with _every_ request it makes to the API to authenticate. This is because the server is typically relatively stateless and does not maintain a session between subsequent calls from the same client. Most APIs (including Yelp) allow you to pass the API Key via a special HTTP Header: \"Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>\". Check out the [docs](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/authentication) for more information.\n",

For data science and _programatic_ analysis this raw form is quite ideal, but for an end user requesting information from a _graphical interface_ (like a web browser) this is very far from ideal since it takes some cognitive overhead to interpret the raw information.
