I had Rooibos tea and a (delicious) apple galette. \n\nI'm basing this on the fact that I love this style of coffee shop (could be in Seattle or Portland). And the fact that since coming to P'burgh for a few days for the first time, it's the first aggregation of non-grumpy people I've been around. Well, to be fair, all the partying college students on the South Side last night were not grumpy. Maybe it's that the folks sitting around me here at Tozza Doro are just chilling, quietly dong whatever they are doing, and not being overly grumpy or self absorbed. \n\nThey don't apear to have more than coffee and pastries, but they do have free wireless.\n\nThere is not as much in this neighborhood as I thought there was going to be, but if you find yourself here, and you like non-corporate, home grown cafes, this is a great place to chill."}

It is it a bit snobbish sure, but not nearly as much as many of the other coffee shops in Pittsburgh."}

I usually go on Saturday mornings/afternoons and tends to be crowed but I've always been able to find a seat!\n\nI've never had a negative experience with staff here. They are always friendly and helpful!\n\nA big plus for this cafe is that it is reasonably priced. I tend to favor their lattes. \n\nThey use Counter Culture coffee here, which I love!

The fruit tart looked great, but it was bland.  \n\nThe atmosphere was not bad at all.  The staff was very friendly.  They appeared to have free wifi as I saw several people with computers hanging out inside.  The food and drink were just not that great, and were too expensive for what they are.  3 stars.  I'd go back for coffee if I needed a quick caffeine fix and was in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way.\n\nI'm sure for some people who like specialty coffee drinks, they probably make 'your drink' just the way you like it - they must, with all the glowing reviews they have on here.

They have so many vegetable options, too. (I'm the type of person to get as much as possible, and just trust that it will taste fine).

As a lover of Pita Pit, I chose them for delivery through Postmates a couple days ago without hesitation. I got the gyro (a Pita I get frequently) and my mother in law got the chicken. My Pita was fantastic as always. My husband didn't order anything because he was somewhat sick and didn't feel up to eating a whole pita, but he did have the last couple bites of mine. This is where everything went wrong. A few hours later I am having intense stomach cramps, chills/sweats, and problems with my bowels. I toss and turn all night with stomach pain. The next day there is BLOOD in my stool. I research all my symptoms and it's all matching up with E. Coli. My mother in law didn't feel sick at all, but me and my husband are both feeling crummy, and I'm left with a bad taste in my mouth (and gurgling in my stomach) from one of my favorite places. What a shame :( \nPLEASE PITA PIT - wash your hands, cook all meat thoroughly, and make sure your veggies are still edible."}

{"author": "Andy P.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2008-05-26", "description": "On my recent road trip from Dallas to New Haven, CT, Randy S. and I stopped in Pittsburgh to revel in its charms. This, I must add, was in opposition to his mother's strong protests to the effect of, \"There's nothing *in* Pittsburgh, why would anyone go there?\" \n\nTazza D'oro is the answer to that question. Especially if you like coffee. This is easily one of the best coffee shops east of the Mississippi, and I've been to a lot of them. So, what's so good about it?\n\nLet's go in order of importance:\n\nCoffee - It is really, really good. They use Batdorf and Bronson beans, where an ex-gf of mine used to work in Olympia. Believe me when I tell you that B&B is good. It's not amazingly great, but it's very solid and they take roasting seriously. When I go to a new coffee place I suspect might be good I always get a latte. Why? This one has a high upside if done well and the lowest downside (lots of milk) if done poorly. I got a latte. They have a few sizes, 12oz was the first one I got. It was fantastic. They did a nice little rosetta in it too (look up latte art on google if you have no idea what this is). The baristo really knew what he was doing and pulled a some good shots with excellent crema. \n\nThe coffee was so good (coffee is supposed to taste bold, smooth and rich, which it almost never does and this place had it down) I had to go back for an 8oz, which is another level of trust. It has the same amount of coffee but less milk to hide poor coffee quality. It was always superior. \n\nThis is a coffee place that is truly top notch based on the coffee alone, but there was more. \n\nPastries - They all looked amazing. I had a plain donut while I waited in line. Normally I don't eat plain donuts, because life is too short for plain donuts, but it was really, very good. Everyone was commenting on how nice the pastries were.\n\nAtmosphere - This place has it exactly right. It's a mom & pop feel, nothing forced. Some tables, outdoor seating, maybe some local art, but not in a goofy sort of way. Very friendly employees. Just a complete home run. \n\nObviously I loved it. Behind me in line for my re-up, I heard a girl behind me in line complain, \"we could just go to Starbucks, it's cheaper!\" then proceeded to order with sugar free syrups and skim milk. That's fine. Everyone has to do what they like... and with the proliferation of bad coffee (Starbucks only being guilty of mediocre, though a little bit interesting coffee) over the past 10 years, I don't blame people for being set that way. But the beautiful thing about Tazza D'Oro (cup of gold in Italian) is that--if you let it--it will remind you that you don't need to make your coffee up like a drag queen on Halloween.\n\nTazza D'Oro stands as a reminder that coffee can be enjoyed in all its naked glory in an awesome setting on a beautiful street and give you a good f'ing reason to go to Pittsburgh."}

But, sometimes you find yourself around the South Side Works area walking around and shopping and all you want is to satisfy a hunger. You don't really want a fancy shmancy meal; you especially don't want to drop one or two Jacksons on dinner. You also don't want to waste good shopping time on eating. You look around the area and your pickins are slim. \n\nTrust me, head over to the Pita Pit. For those of you who don't know what it is - basically, it's Subway on Pitas. You choose your sandwich and then you go to the condiments area and choose your toppings galore. It's got a way better selection than Subway! And, I actually really like their veggie options like hummus and falafel (beats the one selection of Veggie Delight)\n\nEven if you do stumble in here because of my \"quick, easy, and cheap\" recommendation, I assure you the next time you'll go into the Pita Pit just because it was so good the first time around."}

The food is just pre-made salads that sit in a fridge waiting for pick up.  Oh, there are some sandwhiches made to order as well, but it is not overly fancy.  It seems like just a nice, inviting place to order a quick bite over some coffee.  \n\nAh, so most people are going to chat about the coffee on here, which means I get to be the lone person that steps up to the plate and writes about their tea and bites.

Good variety.  \n\nThe atmosphere is JUST what I want when I need a cup of coffee: relatively quiet, comfortable and calming.  \n\nWhen it first opened (how long ago how?) it was mobbed by some of my neighbors (I live in Highland Park) who adopted it as their private club and often seemed peeved at \"others\" who stopped by.   They've either relaxed or found other obsessions.  The clientele is, as folks said, eclectic and invigorating.  \n\nIt's become our after-dinner spot after a meal at Park Bruges or Smiling Banana Leaf, too!"}

When I questioned him why my gift card did not run, he was very perturbed and snapped at me when he had to cancel and re-do the transaction. Then, I ordered the Gyro, which anywhere else would not require much description. Well, I was confused by the fact that I was asked what I wanted on my Gyro (um, the usual Gyro ingredients?!) and that Hummus costs additional (which is not ever mentioned at the register when ordering the Gyro).\n\nMaybe I've never gotten over this initial experience, but I have yet to truly enjoy Pita Pit. I think the Pitas are over-filled with meat and sauce and under-filled with vegetables. Though initially tasty, I always feel very ill after eating here...

I think that I have been to Tazza D'oro once before but it has been a number of years since then.  What prompted this visit for us was that they were on the Pittsburgh Coffee Passport.  Whenever we arrived the place was pretty full, both inside and out, and my wife and I took the last table.  The inside here consists of a bunch of seating, an area to order your coffee and then some paintings on the wall which are for sale.  From our seats my wife and I were able to watch one of the baristas make both a chemex and a v60.  For both of them we watched him measure out the beans on a scale, fine tune the grinder before finally doing the pour over.  It was nice to see that they care that much about their coffee.\n\nFor coffee on this morning my wife and I both ordered the cappuccino.  They also had interesting sounding cardamom lattes and lavender lattes.  After a couple minute wait our drinks were ready and looked pretty.  My cappuccino here ended up tasting quite good and I could tell that the beans were both freshly roasted and ground.  There was the tiniest bit of bitterness which the milk quickly covered for a good tasting drink.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would come back here again in the future.  I liked my coffee here and would be interested in trying a pour over as well as some of their food on our next visit."}

I've been looking for a local coffee shop that made good coffee and didn't have irritating quirks in their service (I've run into a cash-only, lame hours shop and a we-don't-have-an-espresso-machine shop, which are useless to me.)\n\nThe pastry I had was good, though a bit overpriced at ~$3. The mocha I had was absolutely amazing, though their largest size is only 16 oz, which is an adjustment if you're expecting the larger sizes some other coffee shops produce."}

We sat and ate our meals there which were standard tables, nothing fancy.\n\nSuper easy and quick, and we didn't feel bloated afterward.  Next time we go thrifting, we plan on stopping in!"}

A horrible ex of mine loved this place and I admit that this soured me. I regret the time I wasted not going here. The dark wood inside comforts me. The small tables outside are a great place to spend the summer. \n\nTazza D'Oro brews Batdorf and Bronson beans (amazing), provides Enrico pastries (amazing) free wireless (amazing) and one of the most talented and friendly staffs I've ever met (amazing). Everyone who works there is *so* nice and *so* good at what they do. \n\nThey have a small menu of local/fresh food that looks amazing, but I have never actually eaten it. The espresso served here is actually better than the average shot served at Batdorf and Bronson locations in Olympia, WA. I talked about this with one of the barristas at TD'o and they were offended - \"we calibrate our machines the same, we use the same beans, the exact same blends and milks and everything, it can't be different.\" Sorry, Tazza D'oro, you are better. \n\nThe lines get long on weekend mornings, but they move quickly. There's a sense of community nestled here, just off the \"main drag\" of Highland Park, between Bryant st. and the reservoir. This is where you can pick up your CSA shipment for the week, where multiple weekly bike rides originate, where there are lively discussion groups meeting nearly every day. The percentage of students is low. Like the rest of Pittsburgh, there's a good chance you'll run into someone you know, but generally I see people I like and miss, which is different than the norm in Pittsburgh for me."}

There aren't many things I like and once I hit upon things I do like I will happily eat them over and over and over ...  much to the dismay of my husband.\n\nSo we're currently living on the sah'side right around the corner from this place.  We've been here maybe 3 weeks...  eaten here 5 or 6 times.\n\nI love the hummus with tzitziki (sp) sauce and cucumbers on whole wheat pita.  Probably not the most normal combination but I am weird that way and could eat this every night for the rest of my life.\n\nThe turkey is also really, really good.  They serve it hot and it tastes just like thanksgiving turkey, not lunch meat.  Yummy!\n\nPitas are always nice and squishy.  I hate hard pitas.\n\nIt's kinda like subway but different enough that it's a nice change of pace.\n\nThe only thing I don't like about it - and the reason my husband won't actually consent to eat there every night - is they have no kid's menu.  There is a sign inside that says \"Ask about our kid's menu!\" but when we asked, the guy looked at us blankly and said \"Just order something with cheese, or something.\"\n\nThe problem with this is my son has a habit of eating the inside of his sandwich and that's all.  So paying full price for a sandwich he only eats the inside of doesn't sit well with me.  If your kid actually eats the sandwich it's not a big deal.  The place isn't exactly kid-unfriendly, it's just not budget friendly if your kid won't eat it all.  \n\nLove this place!"}
{"author": "Joel R.", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2014-11-28", "description": "On three separate visits, I've enjoyed three great cups of coffee. No complaints there. Unfortunately, that consistency hasn't been there for everyone. On a visit with my wife, her latte came out far too milky. Probably just a mistake, so we reasoned that this place deserved a second chance. The next time around, we order a pair of cappuccinos, one with vanilla --\n\nNow, before I go any further, I recognize that cappuccinos are typically made without sugar or added flavoring. I have also been to a ton of neighborhood coffee shops, have heard the question \"wet or dry\" a thousand times. Sometimes a \"wet cap\" is really what you're hoping for in a latte. And even when it's not, like most people, I don't snark or complain when someone gives me a cup that isn't quite what I was hoping for. I usually end up liking it anyways. My taste buds aren't that delicate.\n\nPerhaps you can see where I'm going with this story. Vanilla cappuccino. I get it, it's not something that's done. But when someone asks you for something you don't sell, just explain the situation politely. If you feel the need to snark, share knowing glances, or anything along those lines, just stifle it. Trust me, I've seen many professionals perform better with requests far more ridiculous. There's really never any need for snobbery. So I've got to dock Tazza d'Oro a bit. Too bad, because the coffee is pretty good."}

Did I mention that I forgot my water bottle on my ride too?  I was a desperate woman at the end of that one.\n\nSo I got home aired myself out and drove myself to Enrico's since a previous yelper mentioned she had the best iced caffe mocha there.  There was easy street parking right out front and I really liked that it was nestled in the middle of a neighborhood and not a loud crowded street.  Tables are large enough for good work space and folks had their laptops out inside enjoying the free wifi while the tables outside were filled with friends.\n\nSo why the 3 stars?  Well the iced caffe mocha was a bit subpar.  The syrup was all at the bottom leaving my first couple sips very watery.  Could have been a better mix.  Would I give this another try?  Sure but I definitely will ask for a nice hard shake of my iced caffe mocha before taking a swig.\n\nThe coffee place at the Walnut Mall in Shadyside is still my favorite for the iced coffee of the year award.

I work in the SouthSide and over the past year the quality of the pitas at Pita Pit has gone downhill significantly.  It started with the pineapple not being fresh a couple of times I went.  The last time I got pineapple on a pita it actually tasted fermented.  I chalked that up to lazy minimum wage employees and improper dating and continued to go to Pita Pit but have not ordered pineapple since.  All other veggies and toppings have always been fresh and crisp.\n\nI've been to Pita Pit 3 times since the pineapple incident and have gotten sick that night EVERY. TIME.  The last time I went there was Tuesday.  I got a Club and the bacon was not cooked the whole way through and my entire pita was warm, not hot like you would expect a cooked sandwich to be.  I watched the cook douse all the orders on the flat top with tap water from a squeeze bottle 2 or 3 times and I believe that employee considered the meat cooked from the steam without actually testing for doneness.  \n\nNeedless to say I will not be returning to this Pita Pit."}

{"author": "Meghan C.", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2011-10-03", "description": "Sorry, but it's overrated to the max! I normally don't review fast food chains, but I'm totally confused by all the extreme positivity here.\n\nThe concept? They take a pita and stuff it with whatever you want. It's kind of like Chipotle in that sense (or Subway, I guess? I've never been to Subway nor have I had a desire to), except without the streamlined assembly line convenience. What makes no sense to me is that you pay first, upon deciding what meat you want. It's also at this point that you must decide if you want anything that costs extra or has to be cooked, like hummus or grilled onions. Then after you pay, you get to choose the rest of your toppings. Why? Why not do what just about every other fast food establishment does and get all your options out of the way BEFORE you pay so you don't get stuck deciding you want to add guacamole at the last minute and having to get back in the register line to give them a couple quarters? It's such a simple little thing, but it really bothers me.\n\nAlso, I've been to this location on multiple occasions and everyone who works here always looks like they are in serious need of a hug. Why IS that? Where do they find these people? Maybe they post Help Wanted flyers at grievance support groups? Seriously, as someone who works in customer service, nothing bothers me more than an employee who does not smile and greet a customer. It's really the easiest part of your job, yet it makes a huge impact. Again, SIMPLE things, but things that leave an impression (at least on me).\n\nSo Pita Pit...work on your operational model and hiring practices, and I could be alright with you. Until then, the way you go about your business will continue to confuse me and I'd rather not bother with it.\n\nPS: I realize that I barely mentioned the food, but it's just that unmemorable. Not bad, per se, but their cold, dry pitas are whatever. It's fine if you just want healthy fast food and you happen to be in the Southside, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."}

It's an awesome cappuccino, topped with a cute foam art leaf.\n\nHere's what I didn't like: Sometimes I take my cappuccino plain, sometimes I take it with a shot of syrup. On this occassion I asked if I could get amaretto syrup, which they had. But the barista responded: \"No, you can't.\" He said they only make their cappuccino plain, and if I liked sweet, he could make me something special, but I would have to trust his taste. Here's the thing...I don't like sweet! I don't have much of a sweet tooth. I just wanted a tiny bit of sweet, so I didn't think trusting his mystery concoction was a good idea. I just got it plain.\n\nI'm not a big fan of coffee shop snobbery nor the fact that this guy seemed to have sterotyped me as a Starbucks-guzzling yuppie who had to be shown what a \"REAL\" cappuccino tasted like. Please, I lived in Italy, I've had a \"REAL\" cappuccino...but right now, I want a flavor shot in it. I still tipped because I wasn't sure if it was the barista or just a general rule at this place, and he did offer to make me something different. I just don't get what the deal is here...why do they even bother having flavor syrups if you're not \"allowed\" to add them to your drink? \n\nIt's a 5-star cappuccino for sure, but I had to subtract a star for the attitude."}

The barista was very nice and very polite. \n\nI sat down inside with my fiancee since the two outdoor seats were taken. It was a little weird. I thought it was going to being kind of an indie/artsy/fun little place, but it was kinda weird for me. The music was so quiet I could barely even hear it. Every time the front door opened, it squealed really loud, and I felt like I couldn't talk to my fiancee sitting right across from me with out the whole room hearing us.

Yes, the coffee is good and if I happen to be lost in highland park someday on foot, I'm sure I'd stop in to get it again.

Glossy refinished exposed wood beams, fake grape vines over the windows, and odd light fixtures create a tacky atmosphere I can't overlook or sit in.

Sometimes, depending on the clientele that day, it can be too quiet and awkward if you're there to chat with a friend, but even then, I've never been made to feel like we're bothering anyone working near us. They have some really nice art up on the walls which appear to be local and for sale. Highly recommended for a stop for anyone in the area!"}

Given that, I consider it a testament to how absolutely wonderful Tazza D'oro is, because one sip of my friend's mocha and I was in silky, smooth heaven. I ordered the hot chocolate, which was every bit as rich and creamy as a hot chocolate should be. \n\nOn to the food - don't come here if you expect a wide selection of bites to pair with your drink. They only had a few options, but from what I could tell, each one was crafted with love, skill, and just the right amount of sugar. I had a fruit tart (berries and strawberries), which was a delightful combination of tangy and sweet. My friend had a very satisfying chocolate croissant - but to be fair, it's difficult to make a chocolate croissant anything but. I was so impressed that I took home an apple puff pastry and vowed to return posthaste. \n\nThis is precisely the sort of place in which Elizabeth Bennet would while away a dreary day, were coffee shops accessible in rural, Georgian England. I wouldn't suggest coming with a large group; neither the limited seating nor the ambience is conducive to that.  It's quiet and intimate - ideal to catch up with friends or bury your nose in a book."}

The locations is pretty, inviting and quiet; Pandora plays in the background - loud enough to enjoy, but not loud enough to drown out your conversation.\n\nAnd conversation there is! It's a wonderful community where the regulars meet of all ages, talking about their families or getting together on Saturday/Sunday afternoon to catch up. Otherwise you can come in do get some work done, discuss your newest project with your coworkers or just fill out job applications and yelp reviews like I do. \n\nThe Service is friendly and pleasant and the coffee is good. Personally, I have been opting for the Tea which is served in a larger pot if you are dining in. Not the highest of high quality, but after all, it's a coffee shop and not Tea [plus my mother spoiled us with Marktfrau back in the day]. When my roommate vouches for coffee, I listen, and Enrico's has been T' approved. \n\nAll in all, like the place and love the community and naturally I will continue to make Tazza D'oro my coffee shop destination."}

This is only due to the fact that all of the patrons were either douchebags / bitches doing their homework/studying/being a hipster, or parents with ugly screaming kids. I rarely get pissed at screaming kids, but I have come to learn that it's because most kids are cute. The ones at the cafe on Sunday were fugnation citizens. The douchey hipster bitches irritated me because they each took up an entire table (reserved for 2 or 4 patrons), and then proceeded to scowl and dart death stares at everyone else who was trying to talk or eat or make noise. LISTEN UP ASSHOLES, IT'S NOT A LIBRARY, SO DON'T GET PISSED WHEN THERE ARE NORMAL SOCIAL NOISES COMING FROM A PUBLIC CAFE. Besides, you are going to fail your exam/write something dumb on your macbook pro anyway, so either put your intellectual props away, or stop being an ass. \n\nOk, moving on. The cafe was easy to find, lots of parking along the street, and the location is great. The people who worked there were awesome. So kind, patient, and genuinely happy to be working there. The baked goods were phenomenal, and they are all made on site or locally. There were SO many to choose from! The artichoke pesto panini was delicious (just not hot; it actually got cold before I got half way through the first half of the sandwich), and the cappuccino was perfect. The ratio of coffee to milk & foam was exactly spot on. \n\nI did end up eating as fast as I could and leaving because of the screaming kids and jerkface factor, but I would definitely visit the place again and get some coffee and make small talk with the baristas."}

Their mochas are heaven and their coffee is pretty much perfect. Their paninis/sandwiches are incredible, although a little on the expensive side. This is very much a neighborhood institution. There's always the same old guys sitting outside and at least one biker grabbing coffee. One of these days we're\u200bgoing to buy some of the art they have hanging inside. This is also a great spot to meet up with clients or just generally discuss business. It's a very productive yet not pretentious atmosphere."}

Tucked away in the middle of a charming old residential neighbourhood, you'll likely miss it the first drive by. Turning around is worth it.\n\nYes the staff tends to be the typical hipster, bike-riding sort that so commonly seems to staff indie coffee shops, but they're friendly and unpretentious, so don't hold it against them.  The patrons are almost exclusively college students (anyone else tends to drive by and take their coffee to go), though hipsters are actually in the minority here.  Anyone under the age of 25 will fit in perfectly, and no one 35 and under will feel uncomfortable.  \n\nThe noise level is perfect.  Most students are on their laptops with headphones, a few are chatting quietly, and the background (indie) music is just that.  You don't need headphones to concentrate here.\n\nDecor is decent without being great.  The ceiling is crossed by beautiful wooden beams, and the floor is a pleasantly bland creamy ceramic tile.  So is the wallpaper, though the original modern paintings tend to help make things interesting.  Where it loses points is in the furnishings: the mixture of wall lamps, hanging fixtures, and pot lights doesn't work well, the serving bar itself is an ugly cheap laminate, and the touches of plastic greenery dribbled around the place fails misserably.\n\nIced water is provided, which is decent (plastic cups are a minus), but inferior to the mineral water other places serve. We tried their richly brewed Ethiopian to rave reviews, with the party split on whether the thick ceramic mug was a plus (hefty and warming) or minus (hard to drink from). Truly fantastic coffee, but the lattes were rather disappointing: Beautifully steamed milk in every cup, but a rather bland espresso shot left the latte rather lacking in the nuanced flavour one finds in a 5 star establishment.  The medium latte (12oz, with 2 shots of espresso -- the steongest ratio they offer) should have been far better.\n\nThe food looked worth having, but we'd just eaten. Homemade pastries and fresh sandwiches looked tempting, and we certainly will come hungrier next time.\n\nA solid four stars, held back a bit by decor and a lot by espresso."}

As long as you get here early enough to get a table, this is a relaxing place to get a good cup of coffee and read a bit or hang out with your people and chat a bit. Staff is chill and low key, and the selection is your basic variety of coffee drinks and pastries. If I lived here I'd hang out here way too often."}

My visit was a 'surprise' from my boyfriend who knows how much I appreciate fine espresso. I was instantly enamored with the set-up inside and the pleasant nature of the individuals who greeted us behind the counter. The baked goods were absolutely fabulous and we literally would have bought one of everything if we hadn't come to our senses. I ordered a grande cafe mocha and it came with a wonderful rim of whipped cream (I believe the whipped cream was homemade as well.... simply to die for) and a subtle addition of foam art which just shows how considerate the baristas are of their craft. My boyfriend ordered the italian cappuccino and said it tasted just like the drinks he would get in Italy over his 2 week visit with family this past summer. Now if that isn't representative of a solid job in bringing a European Cafe to the States, then I don't know what is!"}

Still in the top tier of Pittsburgh coffee shops but not even a contender for best anymore. Vegan apple cinnamon donuts were great but steamed milk on latte was less wonderful than I remember. Brownies: Still a real surperative. But damn, when I'm going to a place like this, for me it's all about the steamed milk."}

Don't forget the avocado!\n\nI would give the place 5 stars, but the staff often leaves you waiting for several minutes before they serve you. The line is usually empty, as is the restaurant. A certain employee seems to usually have his head up his you know what, and makes it seem as if you are being an inconvenience to him. Other than that this is a good place to eat. A good alternative to Subway."}

Ostensibly they should be vegetarian friendly, but they will occasionally put grilled meat all over their work space and then drag my vegetarian pita through it, causing me to have to throw it away and waste money and food (and I get that eating out is always dicey, but this is pretty egregious when it happens). Today it was the other thing that annoys me, when I get a vegetarian pita and they give me only minimal vegetables. Here it is two hours later and I am starving because the dude filled the pita as though the veggies were a condiment to a meat, except there is no meat in my pita. With just a few tweaks they could be awesome, but they mess up the little details."}

I asked \"are you guys closing?\" \"Yeah... we closed at 9:00\" was the response. It was 9:25 at this point. \"Oh my gosh, I'm sorry...\" and before I could finish the guy laughed and said \"yeah... our website is a liar. It says we are open until 10.

I would say it's somewhere between 2 and 3 stars.  Yes, the veggies are fresh and there are lots of them-spinach, red and green peppers, jalapenos, cukes.  However the olives are canned.  I had the chicken souvlaki with veggies and let's just say, it's not Chipotle.  And there was very little chicken-I felt like I was on an expedition.  The place was clean and at about 6PM there were only a couple of people in there.  Also, the folks who wait on you are just as friendly as you would hope.  I just wouldn't go out of my way to get a pita here which is more like a smallish burrito.  And yes, it's inexpensive, however for almost the same $ you get more and tastier at someplace like Chipotle.  However I might go back and try something else."}
