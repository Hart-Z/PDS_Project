"4.0","Much better than I thought it would be, considering it was a chain. The steaks were fantastic. The mashed potatoes were too loose and the green beans were too crisp and needed seasoning. Service was very good and the dining room and open kitchen are well-designed and not too loud. An enjoyable night out."
"4.0","Seeing as I am named Alexander I'm not surprised that a restaurant which shares my name is fantastic. I have eaten at Alexander's several times and the food and wait staff have always been spot on. My favorite dish is the Mafalda Alexander (Mafalda pasta, sausage, and a tomato cream sauce). They give you an un-eatably huge portion which is fine by me, it makes a great lunch the next day. Also, I think the decor and prices make this a great spot for a date night. One minor flaw is that the only parking is metered street parking. It's usually not a problem finding a spot relatively close, however I have run into issues in the past."
"5.0","When it comes to sushi, I'm really picky because I've been fortunate to eat it in Japan a number of times. I wasn't expecting to find great sushi in Pittsburgh of all cities, but Umami has some of the best I've had in the US. You have to make reservations weeks in advance, and for good reason!! I try and make it out here as often as I can. Hands down my favorite restaurant in the city."
"5.0","Beautiful pastry case, excellent viennoiserie, delicious coffee, Bowie on the speakers and Oscar Wilde on the walls. What else do you need?"
"4.0","I'm a big fan of the custom personal pizza concept and this place seems a good version of that. I can't speak for others but the staff was nothing but polite to me. Pizza was tasty and the price was right. Roasted garlic is a potent but excellent addition post cook."
"4.0","The entrance is a little awkward as others have pointed out. It isn't clear how to enter and then once you enter, how to find the actual restaurant.Drinks were great. Excellent sake selection. The cocktails were on point. The Umami bar was very well done.Food was really good. We had ramen and robotayaki."
"4.0","The Capital Grille is an upscale place. The food is good and the service is amazing. I had one bad experience in all my times going, but the response from management was so awesome, I can't even count that against them. Capital Grille used to me my number one go to spot, but I'm not sure it's worth the cost anymore. The steak is always delicious but their sides could be better. I have to say their cheesecake is my all time favorite cheesecake! I'd recommend you give Capital Grille a try if you haven't. It's a nice experience, just don't think I'll be going as often as I used to."
"5.0","Consistently the best food truck at festivals. Friendly staff, delicious food, and bulgogi bowl is truly my go to food truck meal."
"4.0","Most people know this as a great place for ice cream. But I was delighted to find lots of wonderful options for breakfast and lunch. Although the menu is extensive, they can fix your breakfast anyway you like it. Prices are very reasonable.But most of all, I like how friendly the staff are, they welcome everyone and work hard to keep their business.  I had a nice talk with the owner, Natalie,  and I told her I would definitely be back.One other note, they do catering."
"5.0","Excellent sushi!We also had the Beef Maki small plate- which was amazing :)Staff was friendly.  Highly recommend."
"4.0","Biscotti biscotti biscotti!!I love this little neighborhood shop. I'm often reminded of my Nana's house when shopping here.The cookies really are to die for."
"4.0","Came for a working lunch with about a dozen other people. Excellent service. Had the grilled chicken wrap with buffalo sauce and it was delicious! The waiter actually suggested to add the buffalo sauce and I am glad I did. It was HUGE and I managed to eat the entire thing. Food came out quickly and we were in and out within an hour for such a large party. Will need to try again!"
"1.0","Got laughed at by the employees in the back waiting to pick up an order. My appearance isn't relevant to a social situation, especially given a bunch of bros that I don't know. I will not pick up orders here any longer. Disgusting,"
"3.0","Went back here yesterday, seated in the back area which is really nice. Beer was fine. Our waitress seemed to have a chip on her shoulder, she was not very friendly. She was very slow too though I guess she had most of the booths in the back. We had the pierogis which were okay and the buffalo chicken rillettes which were not very good. The presentation of the food is great but in the two times I've been there, the food has been pretty average at best. Will definitely be back but food and service could use some work."
"5.0","always an amazing, friendly, delicious experience. lunch is great during the week days and i always come back for dinner & delivery!"
"3.0","I know, I know, most people come here for the drinks. But my mom and I didn't want drinks--just food in a relatively uncrowded space. The service was friendly and attentive enough given that everyone else in the place at the time was seated at the bar and we were at a table in the corner. My mom got the ribs and really liked them--they were tender and juicy and flavored just right. On the other hand, I made the mistake of ordering their ramen (I know it was silly--who orders ramen from an American bar??). The toppings (kimchi, baby bok choy, mushrooms, and pork) were pretty good, although the pork was not as tender as it should have been. The real issue was that the broth was bland, and the noodles were thin and cheap--the kind you get in instant ramen packs. Come here for the good American food and the drinks (which I hear are good, but I don't know from experience), but definitely avoid any Asian food options they might have on the menu."
"1.0","Delivery was earlier than expected. Pizza was decent but slightly cold. Chicken and broccoli alfredo was disgusting. I asked for extra Alfredo and it's pretty much dry. The chicken doesn't even have a taste and the texture is basically rubber. Such a disappointment."
"5.0","Three things you should know:1.  IF I HAVE A PULSE, I WANT TACOS.2.  This is the taco stand around the corner from Reyna's.  3.  After writing I got so excited for tacos I rescheduled a work meeting to get tacos.THESE ARE THE BEST TACOS IN PITTSBURGH.  Not Casa Rasta (barf), not Reyna, not the Pgh (I Hope You Like Waiting in Line for Underwhelming) Taco Truck.These.  Right here.  So good.  I dont mess around when it comes to tacos.  These are the ones you want.  You dont have time for lousy tacos!The last time I was there it was the ground beef tacos (2 for $5), and a crab meat empanada.  It was so good, I ordered a second order 'for a friend,' and then went around the corner where they couldnt see me and ate the 2nd order.Everything is so fresh and they make tacos the way I would , if I could make awesome tacos.  Cilantro, lime juice, queso fresco....  Okay I need to go get tacos.You need tacos too.This is the best cheap lunch in the Strip District.  And the guys who make the tacos are just...so friendly and funny--they are straight up delightful.   What a strange way to describe someone.  They're really cool guys.  The other day I went to get tacos and the chorizo special he was cooking smelled so outrageously amazing I told him, 'If I could cook like this, I might finally find a husband!'  He made sure I watched him make it so I would know how.  What a sweet guy!I like giving them my money!"
"4.0","I've been kinda skipping over this shop for way too long. I've heard good things but really, pizza is not always my go to. And I think I've been missing out. This place is super, super fun.So you go in and you can pick any toppings, your sauce, and your crust and it's only about $8. WHATTTT! Yeah I know! You get a personal flat bread for that low price. The flat bread appeals to me because I like a little crunch to my crust. Personally thin crust is my all time fave. The pizza cooks pretty fast and a lot of people were in and out while we sat and ate. I got a lot of interesting toppings and some fun flavored oils sprinkled on the top. You can also get some cold toppings once the pizza is finished. You pick what you want. It was fun.I will say that this place was better than expected. I liked my pizza and even had leftovers since it was a big flatbread. Annnddd remember to get your card punched. 9 times gets you a free pizza I believe!"
"5.0","We came here about a year ago and the food was delicious but unfortunately, we didn't get the best service. We came back recently and we were amazed! The food was just as delicious as we remembered! Our server this time was perfect and always filled up our drinks and made sure that we were satisfied! We got the shabu shabu and sukiyaki in one meal, along with a tempura dish, and we were stuffed! Every dish had a wonderful presentation! If you're craving some really good Japanese food, come here! It is a little pricey and in a slow area, but trust me, it's worth it!"
"3.0","Though I have previously reviewed Emporio (floor one) on the other Sienna Mercato listing, I wanted to take the time to review my second experience dining at Mezzo (floor two) here.I dined here years ago and was excited to return. We had purchased last minute (ahem...Groupon) tickets for a show at the Byham and found a great reservation at Mezzo for before the show.Pros:The food was delicious! I ordered the Quattro Formaggi pizza topped with arugula, and it was absolutely fantastic. The cheese packed a smooth yet strong punch, and the crust was perfectly doughy and crispy. I was so disappointed to have to leave half of my pizza at the table since I didn't have time to drop it off at my car in the parking garage before the show.Cons:Five of us were crammed at a four person table. I was stuck at the end and felt like there was no room for my food on the table or for people to safely walk past the table without tripping on my chair. It definitely downgraded the experience.Our server was polite and well-spoken but overall underwhelming. She did ask if we were headed to a show, which I think is very important for servers in the cultural district. However, we weren't checked on after receiving our food, and by the time she stopped by, we were all sitting with our credit cards out of our wallets ready to pay and get to our show. I became frustrated when she casually offered us dessert since we were definitely way too short on time by that point to receive and enjoy it."
"5.0","Intriguing hole in the wall new brewery. Inexpensive. Hip. tasty unique beer. Gin and tonic made with high quality tonic water. Snacks superb. Had Chicarrones and spicy peanuts."
"5.0","I was in need of a quick bite while out on a bike ride and happened upon Alberta's pizza outside of 11th Hour Brewing in Lawrenceville, and I am so glad I did! These guys are putting out the best wood-fired pizza in the city and one of the top pies of any style. We tried the marinara pie and the 'Calabrian Kid', both were incredibly delicious. The later has soppressata, chili oil, and honey, three flavors that form a distinct yet nicely layered flavor. And, the arugula option makes you happy to eat healthily! The price point is very fair and the service is great! I highly recommend seeking this place out, often. I am excited to work my way through different options. Sorry, I did not take any photos but will post some after my next visit."
"1.0","Save yourself the headache and regret, do not order from this shit hole of a restaurant.  I waited half an hour past the latest expected delivery time before calling the restaurant.  I wad told by the lady on the other end of the phone that a lot of things are 'supposed to be' that aren't. My order tracker showed it was not out for delivery yet she insisted it was. I'm not a difficult customer. My order came over an hour later than the latest quoted delivery time. The food was nasty. Everything was cold first of all, but I don't think heat could have saved this meal. The cheese was fake rubber, crust and breadsticks were the same bland cardboard in your mouth. Sauces were disgusting. How badly can you ruin ranch? Make it the texture of slime and no real flavor? Pizza Romano. No. No. No. just don't. Never again for me wow this was the worst experience I've had in quite some time."
"4.0","I would totally come here again....can't go wrong with a classic burger joint that puts their own twist on things. Atmosphere is nice. It's clean, open, and has an industrial feel with the exposed beams. Only complaints I would have is that the server wasn't very personable, more of a 'what do you want' as soon as you sit down type of person...and the music was a bit loud."
"5.0","I've had the pleasure of dining at Thai Gourmet since 2007 but am just getting around to writing a review. I can't say enough good things about this place. The food is delicious, the portions are generous, the service is great, and the family running the place is about the nicest people around. My favorite dishes include the lotus salad, eggplant tofu, basil fried rice, Penang curry, and of course pad Thai. Honestly though, I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. The best Thai food in Pittsburgh. Love, love, love this place."
"4.0","Great, simple bar downtown if you're looking to grab a quick beer and a sandwich after work. Sometimes an overly trendy and over priced bar is just NOT what I'm in the mood for. Sammy's is perfect for those times. The price is right and I love the casual atmosphere to have a few beers and hang out. They have some great beers on tap as well as a good selection of domestic cans and bottles.According to a lot of my friends, the best tasting and priced Bloody Marys around! (I don't like Bloody Marys, but I trust the judgement of my pals when it comes to cocktails!) You can get many different kinds of sandwiches, although they seem to be known for their corned beef or pastrami. The brisket is really good as well! Sides include macaroni salad, potato salad and cole slaw-- all of which I have eaten and enjoyed.Bartenders are friendly and it's surely one of the best deals for a meal and some drinks downtown!"
"5.0","Still the best Thai in Pittsburgh. Their lunch special usually comes with a treat or dessert I always look for. This week was mini egg rolls so crispy."
"5.0","If you haven't tried Luke Wholey's you are missing out on the freshest/finest seafood in the Burgh!  Our waiter Drew told us in all of his years as a server (17 yrs.) he has never worked in a place where they got their seafood and fish in 3 times a day...The Calamari appetizer was light, crunchy and cooked to perfection...it was served with an amazing marinara sauce on top of a bed of arugula...I opted for the Baja Shrimp and Scallops which was served on jasmine rice and drizzled with a sweet soy based sauce in just the right proportion...it was amazing!  My husband chose the Imperial sword fish...blackened and topped with a generous portion of Colossal crab, he raved about it...both entree's were served with grilled fresh asparagus...Portions were just right and prices followed suit....very reasonable!  The atmosphere was pleasant, service was great...a definite go to whether it's a special occasion or just a night out...We'll be back!"
"2.0","So I've been here a few times and it was great the first time, ok the second time, so we gave it a shot again thinking maybe they had an off night before. But it was so disappointing. It was my birthday and we had reservations, when we got there, there was an empty table for 4 and they said it was a 15 min wait , so we waited (only to be seated at that table). Then after we sat it took another 15 for the waitress to come open our wine bottle and bring us water. Thennnnn our food was pretty lackluster. My bf and I loved the JUMBO crab cakes and risotto before, but the past 2 times we went they got smaller and smaller. I was shocked how little they were tonight, like the size of medium 2 shrimps(don't call them jumbo when there baby size, then charge 25$). And the risotto was so watery. I was embarrassed that I recommended this place to our friends (as I'm writing this they legit just walked in from Wendy's bc neither of them liked their meal either). I never write bad reviews and feel bad doing this but what the heck sausalido, get ur stuff together. I'm not even going to go into how bad the bacon pickles were or the Gouda was..... but I felt like they're big fans of microwaves there."
"4.0","Stopped in for a bite to eat with girlfriends - planned to split some appetizers but not great options. We all ended up getting sandwiches and were all pretty happy with our choices! I had the pulled pork and it was good- a little salty. The salt and vinegar fries were delicious. Others commented about saltiness of dishes as well."
"5.0","They have an incredible Crepes! I went this afternoon to Cafe Mona and I ordered the Tuscan Chicken crepe it coms with side salad as most of the dishes in that Cafe, and it's really delicious, the companion of the feta cheese and the artichoke with the fresh chicken is insane!! I just loved it! And I ordered Turkish Coffee couldn't believe how good they made it.The place is Super clean, cozy and they play nice music,they also have outdoor patio and a strong connection Wifi.I think Cafe Mona is my new hangout place. I live in Shadyside and it's about 20 minutes walking. I think it's worth a try. Great experience."
"4.0","I love this restaurant because of its price, not too expensive, and it has Moo Yang and papaya salad, which are quite similar to real Thai food in my hometown in Thailand. Also if you want to try some other dishes besides curry, I recommend Todd Mun, Lotus Salad, tilapia sweet chili sauce, Nam prik."
"4.0","I ordered take out from here and was happy with my order. I had a white pizza with spinach and it was really delicious and filling. The man who made the pizza was Italian, which adds an element of authenticity. The pizza was a far size, for a far price. It's a nice change from the other pizza options in Oakland."
"2.0","Holy Jesus Fuck this place is expensive!We went for sushi. Its listed as a sushi bar, right? WOW... Nigiri is a little more than your 't-shirt and jeans' sushi bar, but you get ONE piece. Not two. Then, they only do hand rolls, no maki. Others seem to like it as a Japanese restaurant. We didn't have the cooked menu. The food was tasty, but if you really want sushi, go somewhere else."
"1.0","The food takes forever to arrive and it's nothing special, just frozen bar food you can literally make at home. The staff seems unhappy and the red headed manager even more so. I watched him leisurely stroll through the dining room all evening with his phone while occasionally stopping to look at the television. I'm not sure how the redbeards in Mt. Washington is so successful because I've never been to that one, but this one is HORRIBLE. Waste of time and money. I'd much rather go to Olive or Twist, or anywhere, really."
"4.0","Being right after a home Steelers game we knew there would be a wait but the manager Clark was SUPER NICE!! Made the wait not a big deal. He came around asking how everyone's meals were and even filled our iced teas. We ordered buffalo chicken dip for an app and I had the chopped house salad which was perfect!! Presentation , temperature and taste! Everything was very good!! We def will be back if in town from New York and when we do we will be looking for Clark!!! Thank you!"
"3.0","I was rather excited to order from here and placed an order through Grubhub. They told me it would take about an hour. After an hour of waiting, I ended up having to wait another half hour. I wouldn't have been as agitated had they let me know it was going to be delayed. The chicken wings are awesome though. So I may order from here again. The delivery driver was also very polite and pleasant. If they could just work on their delivery timeliness, I would make this a five star review to be perfectly honest."
"5.0","Food was delicious even at closing time.  Prices were reasonable.  With an appetizer, 2 entrées, and tip the meal was $40. The staff was professional and hospitable and I look forward to many visits in the future."
"4.0","This is one our regular take out places after a long day at work. My favorite dish is the basil chicken. It can get rather spicy so I usually get a '3'.The basil chicken is very flavorful and comes with white rice. It can easily be made into 2 meals and is very reasonable at ~$10. Their Kee Mao is also good.When I'm in the mood, I'll get their spring rolls which aren't too heavy but still filling. Their chicken satay is a good 'healthier' option but not as flavorful or filling as one might like!Ask for chili garlic sauce on the side if you want an extra kick. The staff is also very friendly and always greets you with a smile on their face."
"5.0","Cafe Raymond is my 'go to' breakfast spot. I know I can depend on them for great food and good service.The omelettes are excellent, so are their pan fried potatoes. I like ordering at the cashier station, and then finding a table, the food seems to arrive faster that way. This is a great spot to breakfast with friends."
"5.0","5 dollar college pizza.  This place is the best. The originator of the $5 Oakland Pizza.It's a solid pie that is good for a quick dinner or great for a late night food after some South Oakland Activities.If you want some extra attention to your pizza get a topping or the garlic crust and it comes out even better for just a little bit more!"
"4.0","Skewers are good.  Sushi is pretty good but not best in Pittsburgh.  A bit pricey compared to competitors with smaller portions."
"4.0","I'm VERY picky about Indian food, and I like it spicy! I was initially nervous about ordering from POI after reading the previous (older) reviews, not to mention my failure to find good Indian food so far in da Burgh!  I'm glad I took the chance:) Delivery was as expected through grub hub, about 60 minutes after the delivery was placed. I added a comment to ask if they would 'please make (the food) very spicy.' And they did not disappoint! Usually my request for very spicy food (a 10 on a spice scale of 10) gets me something more like a 4 or 5 on my personal spice scale. I was so pleasantly surprised that the chole and aloo gobi were made both flavorful AND very spicy. (Literally brought tears to my eyes!) This, however is the kind of spice I like, so for those who can't handle it, be mindful of the spice scale- it's taken seriously! I'm so happy to have found Prince of India delivery and will be trying it again soon."
"3.0","Went here on a Friday with a group of people.  The staff was very friendly.  Even the girls eating their shift meal stopped to say hi.  The overall atmosphere was great and I really enjoyed being there.  The issue I had was with the food and that seemed to be the consensus of the group I was with.  I got the Calamari Fritti, a guy in my group got the Chicken Parm, and another got the Tortellini Verde.  We all agreed that the food was kind of bland.  The guy with the tortellini said the noodle itself was good but the sauce was disappointing.  The calamari on my fritti was cooked well but again the batter was bland.  The sauce on the dish was marinara but to me it just seemed like unseasoned diced tomatoes.  I'm definitely willing to give this place another chance.  Another guy in the group had the lobster ravioli and said it was good so it's possible some things on the menu are just better than others"
"2.0","Disappointed. When asked to get one order to go and one for here they were not accommodating at all. It was inconvenient and frustrating that they only accept cards and not cash. Overall, it was an unpleasant experience. Service was mediocre at best regardless of the satisfactory food."
"4.0","Recently had the opportunity to eat here for a work event and could not have been happier.  The atmosphere, service, and food were all top-notch.It was restaurant week during our visit which made for a shorter menu than usual.  However, every dish looked and tasted delicious.  For my meal I went with the field greens salad.  The salad had a great flavor and I loved the dressing.  Made for a great starter.  For my meal I went with the Grille's Signature Cheeseburger.  I ordered mine medium rare and it was cooked to perfection.  The meat is topped with a delicious white cheddar and candied bacon.  The sweetened bacon and high-quality cheese made for a great flavor.  The meat was a delicious blend and tasted very fresh.  The bun was also a great choice and held everything together perfectly.  The burger came with a side of truffle fries which had a great crispy texture to them.  The fries went very well with their house made ranch."
"5.0","The food is absolutely delicious. I went here probably 4+ times and would love to go again. You definitely cannot go wrong with trying this place out!"
"4.0","Went there last night (Tuesday).  They only had two people working the front since it was a Tuesday and restaurant week had ended a couple of days earlier.  That was a mistake.  There was a large business dinner going on and almost everyone else in the restaurant was there to redeem their Groupon before it expired today (8/20/14).  Half of the tables were  being used and the other half  had to be cleared.  We had to wait about 15 minutes before they got around to clearing off a table for us, however, once we got seated, the service was at a slow pace, but bearable.  Have to hand it to the two waiters.Menu was limited but interesting. Had the pork chop. It was HUGE and tasty. Ended up taking half of it home.  The better half had the crab cakes which were also very good.  The white bean dip and bread also very also hit the spot.Will go back again to try the other things that interested me.  Hopefully, the staffing will be better planned the next time."
"3.0","It's a nice hole-in-the-wall bar with a pretty good food selection. The happy hour prices are good, but only include a handful of ales (and I did not know that the beers I ordered were not on the happy hour list - my bad). The food is good, not great - typical bar food."
"3.0","Food was good. Especially the French toast and brisket hash. But I was pretty disturbed to see the cook (white male with curly hair) touching people's food with his bare hands almost the entire time. Grabbing potatoes, bacon, ham, everything with his bare hands. He put gloves on briefly when he saw that I was staring him down and about to get up and say something to him. After we got our food I saw he took his gloves off again and was handling food again with bare hands! Super gross and disturbing. I had my mom with me who is currently undergoing chemo and her immune system is already low because of it. I won't be back. Super disgusting to see that."
"3.0","I got spoiled eating some of the best fried chicken ever living in Texas. This place doesn't disappoint though. Bomb chicken fingers and golden crispy light crinkle cut fries. Their chicken is very juicy and flavorful with a nice crisp batter. Good zing to it. Great salad too!"
"5.0","The tenderloin and chicken heart skewers are delicious. Our favorites were the shumai and spicy scallop hand roll. Our salmon sashimi was very good and fresh. I wish had our servers name, he was very informative, attebtive, and nice! We'll be back for more!"
"4.0","Delicious taco truck in the strip district. Chorizo, carnitas, and chicken tacos were great. Huarache was good, but smaller than we expected - not as much bang for your buck. I'd definitely eat here again."
"4.0","Pretty good Indian place around Pittsburgh. I've heard good things about this place. The naan here was just AMAZING. I ate so much naan. The garlic ones were especially delicious. I ordered a chicken tikka masala and it tasted pretty good but I'm not the best judge of Indian food since the same dishes taste the same to me no matter where I get them. The food time was very long maybe it was because I was with a large party but I waited basically an hour to get my food. Overall, I would come back just for good Indian food but the waiting time was a bit sad."
"5.0","Best place in Mt Washington. Excellent cocktails and food...but THAT BEER LIST THOUGH! So darn good."
"2.0","Tacos lacked flavored. Collectively my group tried the beef /chicken tacos and nachos. The garnishment was weak and skimped on meat. It's a pass! Aura was hipster and played a mix of pop and rock. Service is slow only two meal preps serving on a Friday night in a restuarant /night spot district."
"5.0","Modest looking place  but a cut above typical Thai. First of all, they offer you spicing options on 0-10 scale, and so if you like your Thai food hot, or not , that's what you'll get. Second , they speak vegetarian and vegan.   Third, this is not a fancy pants type place.  The mango sticky rice dessert is especially good , the rice part more complex that many places."
"1.0","Unfortunately, I can't give zero stars for this place!Sticky table, lousy, slow service, meh food. The only thing good was joking about how bad it was afterward. Only three of the four of us got their food.... but no silverware. We were told that the missing food would be five minutes.... lol... we were already done our meals and check on the table .... waiting for the boxed meal ( my friend had given up and left ). They obviously hadn't bothered to prepare his meal.I think to top things off, we never got a visit from a manager.In addition to the bad food and lousy service, I was overcharged on my credit card, luckily I resolved the issue through my card service. With all the choices available on the North Shore... I certainly won't go back to this dump"
"5.0","Stopped by for an early dinner with my kids, we had a great experience and our server Susan was awesome. We will definitely be back!"
"4.0","I'm surprised this place doesn't have better reviews.. The food was so great, service was great too. Although I'm disappointed that for 2 dinner entrees we only got one small plate of rice and ended up having to pay $2.99 extra for rice, even though I think we should of received 2 plates of rice for 2 entrees."
"1.0","Unfortunately we had another bad experience and will not return, this is the 2nd time we had a problem with service. We really felt disregarded and an after thought. When our food was dropped off nobody check back with us, we had the flag someone down to let them know that the potatoes were cold not even remotely warm, and  My steak was supposed to be medium well and was a little  past rare. I understand this restaurant is busy but don't seat a table if the servers can't handle it."
"5.0","Start to finish excellent service. The food was absolutely delicious! I had the lobster roll and 2 lbs of Alaskan king crab. It was cooked to perfection and is now one of my favorite meals of all time!! I will be back soon!"
"5.0","I'm giving this 5 stars even though they have a serious service problem for Sunday brunch when the back patio is open.  The food is all fresh and excellent.  I got the banana nutella crepe and a bagel breakfast sandwich. Both were perfect and excellent.  My friend got the $20 3 course brunch with a turkey crepe, fruit cup and nutella crepe.  All were excellent, but they were all brought out at the same time which really doesn't fit the 3 course bistro marketing of this place.  So if you come on a nice sunny Sunday for brunch, be prepared for so-so service.  We waited a long time for someone to take order and for the food to arrive.  Once it arrived, we never saw the server again.  We had to go to the front to pay and our server had to ticket for us, we had to remind him what we ordered and he figured it out.  We will be back because the food is so excellent, but maybe on a day that is not so busy."
"5.0","This place is awesome. Highly underrated! The food is delicious and the warm cozy atmosphere is so inviting and makes you want to drink their fantastic brews all night long. The schnitzel sandwich is absolutely killer and the scotch egg is as good as it gets."
"2.0","good store,good food,but cashier the (older guy) always trying to rip you off. Be very careful at the checkout. He always trying to charge you twice for the same goods. Check your receipt and quantity. They did it couple of times to me"
"5.0","I have been going here my whole life, and I can say without a doubt that I have yet to ha e a bad experience. I have had almost everything on the menu and everything is amazing. Very filling portion sizes and great service. They offer a lot of good wines and a unique beer menu. All of their desserts are made on site, i highly recommend the rice pudding. If you find yourself in Little Italy (Bloomfiled) the best place to eat is Alexander's."
"5.0","Great service and reasonably priced food. Was very crowded but it didn't seem to slow down the service or the time to get our food. Portions are huge!"
"4.0","Not the place for local, organic, grass-fed, gourmet riff-raff. Pamela's is known for stick-to-your-ribs diner food and they do it very well. Definitely my go-to for weekend brunch or hangover recovery in Pittsburgh. The Oakland location you'll find is often full of Pitt or Carnegie Mellon students, whereas the Squirrel Hill and Shadyside locations usually have a more yuppie-type clientele.Pamela's hotcakes are a masterpiece. Never mind that they use pounds and pounds of butter for these hotcakes, you'll be hard-pressed to find pancakes/crepes as delicious as these. What's great is that they can be eaten alone in a savory manner, or piled with fruit and whipped cream and more butter for a sweeter breakfast experience. The lyonnaise potatoes are also something to marvel at. You can ask them to griddle the potatoes a little longer for a crispier taste, which I definitely recommend. The omelets are all pretty standard fare here, but they do them consistently well every time I've been. Best thing is that most combinations or menu items will only run you at about $8-10, with tip and tax about $13. Pretty awesome. Only downside is that it's cash only, but since there are a couple ATM's and a PNC nearby, it can be overlooked. Overall, come here for some of the best breakfast comfort food that Pittsburgh has to offer."
"5.0","I can't believe I just tried this place for the first time last night. Last night (middle of August, 90+ degree heat and humidity), I did not feel like cooking, so my boyfriend and I decided to get some Chinese food. He told he had been here years ago, but not recently, and I have never been, so why not give it a try?! We got to Chinatown Inn around 9 pm and there was hardly anyone in the restaurant. (I did notice that a lot of people were coming in and out to get takeout.) Upon being seated, we were given water, hot green tea, and the crispy noodles with duck sauce and hot mustard. *note- the duck sauce at this place is more of a brown color and tastes a little different than the duck sauce I'm used to. Not a bad different, but different. Anyways, I digress... We ordered the crab Rangoon for an appetizer. I ordered a mixed seafood Chinese hot pot and my boyfriend ordered chicken and eggplant. The menu is really diverse.. They have a little something for everyone. Our food came out quickly and was nice and hot! Everything was really delicious and the portions were generous! My hot pot had lobster tails, scallops, shrimp, calamari, and Mixed veggies in a garlic and ginger white sauce. It was so good!! I definitely will be back to try out some other items on the menu!"
"3.0","I stopped by a week ago for lunch with a friend.  We intended to stop by the new PB&J place down the street, but they're closed on Mondays, so we decided to stop by one of the two Thai restaurants on Liberty instead.  Given that the first one we passed was closed, and that this one was open, we decided to try it out.Given that I'd never had one before, I decided to start off my meal with a Thai iced tea ($2).  If you enjoy Southern sweet tea, as I do, you'll probably enjoy the Thai version, which is topped with sweetened condensed milk.  This ended up being the best part of the meal for me, as I was underwhelmed by my order of pad kee mao (spicy basil/drunken noodles; $9).  As I've never had this dish before, it may be that I just ordered the wrong thing--I probably should have stuck to the pad Thai to be safe.  At any rate, I found the dish kind of flavorless and bland, and not to have much of a kick at all despite ordering a spice level of 4/10--I definitely wouldn't order it again.I think this place is about middle of the road for PGH Thai cuisine.  To my palate, the quality of the food here is equivalent to Smiling Banana Leaf, but not as good as Spice Island or Nicky's, the latter of which remains my top choice for Thai cuisine in PGH.  While I wouldn't seek it out, it was good enough for lunch on a Mon. when a lot of other places are closed.  3.5 stars."
"5.0","My girlfriend and I came for their Restaurant Week prix fixe menu. The atmosphere was more far casual than I expected for a quality seafood restaurant, but there was a good mix of people young and old and it felt lively. The service was friendly and prompt. Our appetizers were the ceviche and lobster bisque. The bisque was creamy with good flavor, while the ceviche was absolutely outstanding - colorful, fresh, and tangy. Our entrees were the filet mignon oscar and the crab gnocchi. The steak was a tender and flavorful and my girlfriend raved about her gnocchi. The deserts were another highlight. The vanilla cheesecake was what you would expect, but the flourless chocolate torte was a dream of creamy, molten fudge. The regular menu can be pricey and parking in the Strip is never enjoyable, but I highly recommend Luke Wholey's for it's superior product."
"4.0","Stopped here on our way back to our hotel after a really crappy Steeler game and a big loss at the casino. Plus it was raining and humid. Waitress was awesome, very friendly and attentive. We ordered nachos with grilled chicken and stuffed banana peppers (weird combo, I know). They were both very good, the ingredients were very fresh!I would definately go back, nice little bar."
"5.0","My favorite haunt on lazy weekends.  Luke's lobster bisque is the best I've had.  Monterey, Carmel, La Jolla, Fishermans Wharf San Fran, etcetera.  Yet somehow a fisherman in Pittsburgh has the best....by far.   Not to sell Luke short, the entire menu here is spot on.  The staff are happy and friendly. Brian is especially good. A server with friendly attitude and remembers your drink.  Solid all around joint in the Strip.  Highly recommend."
"3.0","So this review is purely based on Rialto's delivery. This was my favorite place to get pizza from in college. i had LOTs of rialto's. my fav was the ranch steak pizza as it had fries on it  AND ranch dressing. what's not to like?The normal steak pizza is also quite good."
"5.0","Tried Mr Bulgogi for the first time at the PGH Taco festival. Hands down one of the best food trucks there."
"3.0","Not bad I tried it for the first time because my brother and dad liked it. Me and my daughter liked it, but it was little portions and expensive even tho it seems like it's a good price. Would really like to try when they have a fish taco when they open the new restaurant."
"4.0","Cute small taco shop with great food at cheap prices! Be sure to ask for their special of the day for something different. Keep in mind the menu is pretty small and there's limited seating. Definitely check it out if you're looking for a casual lunch and craving a good corn tortilla taco."
"4.0","Another reason to love Sienna Mercato! My first experience with Mezzo was deeelicious. They have your typical Italian fare with a few unique spins to the menu. I went for the Vegetable Panini which was amazing! Nice thick, crusty toast with perfectly roasted vegetables in a cheesy blanket. SOO yummy! I also ordered a side of spaghetti squash which is surprisingly sweet because it's tossed in a honey blend. Sounds strange but it was a nice contrast to the savory panini. Definitely recommend this restaurant for anyone in an Italian mood. Mezzo will not disappoint!"
"5.0","What a great location for lunch!  It's very casual, you pay for your food prior to sitting down.  The meal I had here was great and the servers were very attentive.  I've also gone here for happy hours and the music was wonderful.  Plus you get free food with your drink purchase and drinks were very reasonably priced as well.  Wish I had made a point to come here more often during the summer!"
"5.0","My new favorite breakfast place in the Burgh! Great coffee, flavorful food and good service. The owner is lovely and the spicy red peppers are amazing! Love this wonderful addition to our burgeoning food scene"
"3.0","I wanted to enjoy Cinderlands, I really did.  However, the food was simply sub-par.  We went during restaurant week and chose two different sandwiches, neither of which were particularly impressing.  We had the Banh Mi and the chicken parm, neither of which was particularly flavorful, and both of with I could have made much better at home.  We didn't even eat the leftovers.  The three stars is for the sweet potato fries, which were actually quite delicious.  The server was nice and the beer list is probably impressive if you are into beer, so maybe give this place a chance - but beware the sandwiches."
"5.0","Rialto has never let me down.  We've had pizza,  sandwiches pierogie and various sides and appetizers here over the years and have never had a complaint.  Delivery is fast and takeout is always ready when they say it will be. My only complaint is that they don't have a second location on Butler."
"1.0","I should have known something was wrong when the restaurant was locked and the host had to come and let us in, in the middle of the day.A co-worker and I went there for lunch. We sat down, got our drinks and menus right away. We put in our order fairly quickly, but then proceeded to wait for 40 minutes for our food. I got mine right away, but the server told my co-worker that they didn't have what he ordered.  They didn't tell us in the time that we waited that the grill was down and it was an extremely limited menu. He requested the menu again and proceeded to eat his side salad. After waiting 10 minutes for the menu he decided not to get anything else because he didn't want to wait another 40 minutes and be late. Other tables were also quite upset with service. Another individual ordered steak rare, but came out burnt to a crisp. Another table ordered appetizers shortly after we sat down, and did not receive them until after we got our entrees. Not only that, they ordered the sliders, and were not told that they were unavailable due to the grill being down until after they received their wings as apps. Never once did the servers ever seem to care or try to improve their attitudes. I would have been understanding with the grill being limited as long as we were told ahead of time, or if they actually seemed to care about the us.After waiting another 20 minutes for refills and the check, we finally left and will not be returning."
"5.0","I'm from Texas where everything is bigger. And the portions here are impressive! The food itself was amazing. If you're looking for good ole fashioned hearty food look no further!"
"5.0","Had a wonderful dinner!  The polenta fries are crunchy and the inside creamy.Everything was wonderful and perfect.   My sister keeps talking about the 'Old Fashion' drink.  Just can't wait to come back to this gem!"
"5.0","The pizza is so good whyyy did i find this place. If i could rate it 10 I would. The staff is super friendly. The options are endless. The soda is good too. I have to make this a treat on cheat days because i would otherwise go at least 2 times a week ha lol."
"5.0","BullDawg's came to a community event in my town. They had a few different options of hamburgers or hotdogs. We ordered the bbq burgers, that came with good hand cut fries. And philly steaks that also came with fries. $11 per meal was not bad. It took about 10-15 for out food to get done, no big deal because it was fresh! I did not eat the philly steak but the burger and fries were delicious. I'd definitely order from this food truck again."
"1.0","We walked in and before we were fully seated the server asked if we were ready to order. We asked for a minute to look over the menu and literally never saw her again. We waited for 20 minutes before just getting up and leaving. We also had our baby with us, which doesn't demand special treatment necessarily - but I always appreciate a server who understands how helpful it is to be prompt when you have young children with you. To add insult, the other server working was leaning on the bar on her phone and the restaurant wasn't very busy - a total of 4 tables sat."
"4.0","I was here this summer. It was busy, it was warm, and it was fun. My suggestion is to make this an early stop to avoid the lines everyone is complaining about."
"5.0","Yum.  So we have been coming to Cafe Raymond since they were in a much smaller space.  As they are in their new location they have expanded their menu and kept up the wonderful dishes.  Ricotta Pancakes might be the best I ha e ever had.  Fresh croissants and wonderful portions of ham or bacon.  It's really really good food not cheap food served fast and greasy.  I highly recommend this place."
"5.0","One of the best chicken sandwiches I've ever had. Chicken is juicy and well seasoned. Most spicy food has heat but no flavor but that's not the case here. Everything here is top notch"
"5.0","First tried it in February 2019 while at Hitchhikers at Sharpsburg; tried it a few more times since then. There's no way to describe the food, except for fresh and flavorful. The dumplings have either scallions or some other herb that makes them stand out over all other dumplings I've had in the past. The tacos or bowls are bulgogi and pork and a party of well blended flavors. The yum yum/ spicy mayo they use on their bowls has a kick but it surprisingly manages to not overpower the rest of the flavors. To say I'm a little obsessed with the food would be an understatement. Plus, the people who run it have always been great! Follow their instagram for updates on where they'll be next, you won't regret it!"
"5.0","I've been eating salems for over 5 years and I've never had a bad meal. The staff is very friendly, the portions are more than you can finish and the food is delicious"
"5.0","This place is great! The burgers were juicy and perfectly cooked, the French fries were awesome, and the fried chicken was some of the best I've ever had! I would recommend this place to anyone."
"5.0","I like Gennaros. Standard pizza hole in the wall kind of place. They're never busy and the staff is always grumpy but the pizza taste good so I keep going back. Prices are middle of the road and the same as pizza Sola and sals. If your looking for a local pizza place that serves decent food go here."
"5.0","Super spicy! I like spicy, but a level 3 was good for me. Anything more would have been too much. I just got the strips and fries, I will go back and get the sandwich next time! Highly recommend if you like spicy chicken."
"5.0","I had the marinara pizza. As a vegan, it is nice that they include a vegan option in their menu. The pizza was tasty and I enjoyed it a lot!"
"5.0","Visited on the 4th of July- surprisingly it wasn't that crowded! This place can get really busy on weekends- hence why I haven't visited before. I went with a breakfast that included a blueberry ricotta pancake, potatoes, two over easy eggs, and bacon. It was absolutely delicious. The pancake was so flavorful and all of the food had that homemade with love kinda taste. MHM! I cannot wait to come back! Also, check out the awesome deck on the upper level of Cafe Raymond on a nice day!"
"5.0","My friend suggested Thai food for dinner one night, so we just popped into the closest place to pick it up. We ordered take out, and it was ready in about 10ish minutes. The ladies at the front desk were very friendly, and we were very excited that our food was hot and ready so quickly.I ordered pad thai with chicken. They asked for spice level. I do like a little kick, but I'm always hesitant when I don't know how a restaurant spices things, so I said a three. I wish I had said 5 or so because there was no spice in a three. But now I know for next time!Overall, we were very happy with our take out order and will continue to choose this restaurant when craving Thai food!"
"4.0","When I stopped in here, I did so without realizing they had just opened two days ago. The atmosphere is casual which I liked. You order at the counter and if you are eating in, they'll bring your food to you. Since it was a hot day, I ordered a cold brew coffee which was very good. There were quite a few coffee and tea options. I look forward to trying the casserole and hot dishes, but today was a scorcher so I ordered their tuna sandwich with a side salad. The tuna was delicious and not heavy with mayo but included tuna, eggs, potatoes, olives, and vinegar with a touch of mayo. I had it in a croissant which was delicious. The side salad simply had cucumber and chopped onion. While there was oil and vinegar at the table, I would have preferred it dressed up a bit with something flavorful. It was quite warm in the cafe though and since it was so hot today, I was looking for some respite from the heat so in that sense it could have been a little better. The service was so nice and friendly and they were very happy to answer any questions! Looking forward to trying more!"
"4.0","We stopped for dinner one evening, my fiancé and I had fried mozzarella wedges and shared a plate of fish and chips. The mozzarella wedges and the fries were good, the fish was a bit dry. We liked the environment and it was an easy walk from our hotel so it gets 4 stars from us."
"5.0","I am new to Pittsburgh and the Lawrenceville neighborhood. This is my favorite restaurant in the city so far. We love trying all the new beers that are released, and are never disappointed. Everything is inventive, flavorful, and better then the last. My favorite beer so far was the Falling Petal sour collaboration with Umami, I have never had anything like it and hope it comes back. The employees are super knowledgeable about the brew process and can give you a full description of each beer. Their happy hour and new release specials are always a great perk when we come in on a week night. The food is always superb, our favorites are the fried chicken sandwich, soft shell crab sandwich, and mushroom 'risotto'. Each bite of everything we have ordered has been nothing short of delicious. Each time we have made reservations or had friends join us mid-seating, the restaurant has been super accommodating. My boyfriend and I have made Cinderlands our once a week spot, and we will keep coming back!"
"1.0","My first experience with Rialto was unimpressive at best. I felt I way overpaid for a pizza that stood apart from no other toss n bake pizza. My second experience was better. I still paid a premium (nearly twice a competitors price) for an Italian hoagie. The hoagie impressed me so I figured this would just be an occasional hoagie fix foir me. Until today. Today I decided to gain back twice the calories I dumped on my bicycle ride. I stopped in and the A/C was nice so I decided to eat in. I ordered an Italian hoagie again, no tomatoes (I'm allergic). I was told 5 minutes and had a seat. Now there was an older man there eating a pie. I casually noticed he was eyeballing me. a few moments later he sauntered right past me and interrupted a table full of patrons as if he knew them. He began asking a young woman about her bag insisting he wanted a bag just like it (I think it was her purse). He carried on and on while they listened with puzzled facial expressions. I could tell they were uncomfortable. Other patrons took notice as well. He concluded by introducing himself by name and informing the woman that if she didn't want her bag, he would take it. Now i'm sure this man is harmless. Probably a regular from the neighborhood who just needs social interaction but lost his social skills during a tragic fall. The place probably even has a nickname for him. None the less I determined I would just take my order to go now and hopefully before he got to my table. Until it was placed in front of me. It had tomatoes. I explained I asked for no tomatoes. The man looked at the receipt, looked at the hoagie, and went through the motions of a mental conflict of what to do next. He explained 'I'll just throw this away and make you a new one'. I said i'd like it to go now. He left the hoagie and started walking away. He did a double take, asked me what I wanted him to do as if we didn't just discuss it. I explained, i'll take a new one; to go. Precisely 120 seconds later a bag fell onto the table and a 'sorry about that sir' was murmured out of left field. No way this was a fresh hot hoagie. If you want to take it to the back, pick the tomatoes off, toss it in the oven for 60 seconds and dump it back in front of me you might consider allergens. The food is tainted now and a greater liability to your business than the loss of a hoagie. You also lost a customer. I don't like waste. But food restrictions are food restrictions. I would have picked them off myself if it was ok to do so. The receipt says 'no tomatoe' in red. You screwed up, you eat it. Further you shouldn't allow patrons to wander about table to table and harass other patrons. To think I spent money on that experience. Never again."
"1.0","Left the Pirates game early to walk to this place to get rooftop bar seating. On here, their hours say they close at midnight. Walked 15 minutes only to be told that tonight they are closing the second we walked in the door, before 11 pm. Really? People who want to go out after the game and Yelp a rooftop bar and this place shows up, only for them to close before the game is out on a Monday night and refuse customers. Nice."
"5.0","This is the perfect lunch spot. I love their twisted ginger tea and they have excellent sandwiches and salads"
"5.0","I'm going to start with the bottom line for this place: Awesome. Affordable, delicious, and saucy entrees provide both filling and tasty meals. The beef and broccoli has a liquidy, mouth-watering sauce that is soaked into the broccoli and meat, providing an amazing experience for one's taste buds. Whats even more awesome, are the daily lunch specials. These give you a regular entree, along with your choice of rice and your choice of soup or egg roll, for only $8.50 or so. ALL of the food is cooked well and never failed to please me. With the extremely affordable price that can sometimes be cheaper than fast food, and the absolutely wonderful food selections, Chinatown Inn makes a spectacular meal that can't be missed."
"5.0","Great seafood place. Fun laid back atmosphere. Staff were so friendly and helpful. Food was very delicious."
"4.0","I ordered the allegheny roll and the crab miso soup. So good! Especially for sushi not in California. I hadn't ever had crab miso soup, but it was definitely worth a try!"
"5.0","Of the cocktail bars I've tried in Pittsburgh, The Summit is probably my favorite. I like that the drink menu changes frequently and I like that they always have a theme to their menu. But what I love most of all is how well thought out their drinks are and how refined they taste. I feel like their cocktails use good quality spirits and the combinations are so inventive. The bartenders here really know what they're doing. The space is a little small, but it's quite trendy, yet casual at the same time. They have some board games so I like that they encourage you to stay a while and have a good time. Definitely my go-to for cocktails!"
"4.0","Just moving to Pittsburgh and knowing no one is rough. I live in Mt. Washington and have been really trying to explore. I stopped into The Summit last night after work. What a cool place. The tunes they play are good, not too loud and the atmosphere was welcoming. I sat at the bar and their drinks look beautiful. I simply enjoyed a few glasses of wine. Bartenders are friendly and not pretentious and the crowd is an eclectic mix of folks. The people next to me got the soup of the day and it looked and smelled divine. Little tip they do mulled wine, I found it too late, but once we get a little snow I can't wait to return and sip on some."
"5.0","A great restaurant with excellent food and craft beer ! The owners operate 2 other restaurants and have been in the business for many years They are pros and have set a very high standard for their restaurants The employees are exceptional friendly and proud of the quality food and drinks that they serve The brewmaster recently traveled to Ireland for new beer and ale ideas You will enjoy a night here !! Highly recommended!!"
"5.0","We absolutely love it here. Local family owned feel and dated down to earth decor. The owner is so personable and friendly. We will defiantly be back."
"5.0","It's strange to me how this taco stand is basically around the corner from Casa Reyna's stand, basically being an 'in your face' type of competition. The setup seems fine though, and I frequently see customers clambering over both. That said, while I haven't been to Edgars' main restaurant, I can vouch for their stand. Their variety definitely beats Reyna's stand, while prices are a tad higher. In addition to all sorts of tacos (including fish and shrimp!), they have some choices of empanadas, quesadillas, etc.Tried the carnitas, carne asada, lengua, and barbacoa--all were delicious, and you can tell them to put the toppings of your choice while they make it (asking them to put everything is by far the best choice). The guy who takes your order is super friendly, with an 'hola, como estas' for every customer. They also have watermelon agua fresca and horchata, both of which seem freshly made; the watermelon was delightful. Finally, while the wait may be a little longer than other stands, there are some complimentary chips and salsa for you while you are waiting. 10/10 would return again."
"4.0","The Bloody Mary was delicious!! I had the standard with shrimp - yummy!!! He ordered lobster roll sandwich, lobster bisque & cole slaw; I ordered the lobster bisque, it was a little creamier then I like but good, the mini crab cakes were very good. Service was great & we will be back for sure."
"4.0","Met up with some friends on a Sat night for some dinner/drinks.  I was ready for a wait, as Sat night most places are busy.  I was surprised when we were seating immediately and there wasn't many people eating (also worried..why is nobody eating?).The place is smaller than i expected, but there is another bar and seating upstairs which we didn't know about.  Our waitress was quick and very nice.  Food was typical bar style food, burgers, fries, wraps, salads, etc.  Prices seemed fair.  I got a Yuengling bottle for 3.75 and a turkey wrap for around $10.  Their weekly specials were impressive (AYCE Crab legs on monday ~$27, AYCE wings on Wed ~$10, $1 tacos on Tuesday).My only gripe is the cost my fiance's Moscow Mule..$12 bucks!  This isn't an upscale place, idk what they're thinking charging that much.  They're lucky I didn't catch the price before she ordered it.Overall, food was good and arrived quick.  Service was very good and our meal was less than 50 even with the stupid ass 12$ moscow mule so that was a plus.  I'll be back soon and try out the AYCE wings."
"4.0","Great burgers, fresh and best tasting -- great cut of beef! Rest of the Arabic food is above average and for me that means much much better than most places!! Again, amazing burgers."
"5.0","I have been going here since I was a little girl and have never been disappointed. The service is great. Tea is fabulous. The jumbo shrimp egg rolls are a must! I had the plum wine yesterday and it was yummy!"
"5.0","One of the best breweries in Pittsburgh. In only a short amount of time they have separated themselves from the rest. Really great beer AND really great food. It seems it is usually one or the other but they have managed to do both great!  The service also is amazing from management to the servers. Do yourself a favor and give them a shot."
"1.0","This place is so americanized. The food has no  spice and or flavor. So much rice with you order in a to go plate that your order has no sauce."
"4.0","We had to stop when we saw their Bloody Mary topped with soft shell crab, shrimp, and bacon! It's nice because you can build it however you want so you don't have to get certain toppings if you don't want them. Their standard Bloody Mary is $11 and then +$2 for shrimp and +$11 for soft shell crab. Then you can add different spice levels for +$1. I chose the medium spice level which was a perfect spicy taste but didn't give me a burning cough. These bloody Mary's are awesome and the add one are well worth it!"
"2.0","With all of the amazing restaurant options in Pittsburgh, you can do far better than Sausalido.I want to begin this review by saying that what really upset my group was the bad service and overall unprofessional nature of the staff.  We overheard a member of the kitchen staff using profanity to describe our table, and it was obvious that they all just wanted us to leave (we had a later reservation on a Friday night). However, our server literally disappeared for a half an hour after clearing our table, so we couldn't have paid if we wanted to (which we desperately did at that point - they seriously made us feel so uncomfortable).I saw on another review that someone's experience was interrupted with a screaming match between the kitchen and the front of the house, so it's my guess that professionalism isn't really paramount here. So, now on to the actual food.  The white bean dip, which everyone raves about, was definitely great and a nice touch.  The entrees ranged from not that great to pretty good.  The menu itself just wasn't very interesting and there were few unique items listed.  Someone at my table had pumpkin ravioli, which were obviously filled with canned pumpkin that was probably bought at Trader Joe's or Giant Eagle.  I guess it's hard to expect fresh pumpkin at this time of year though! (Which is why it probably shouldn't be on the menu... but I digress.)Overall, the menu was average, the food was mediocre, and the service was deplorable.  If you're looking for a great BYO Italian restaurant at this price range, there are far, far better options.  E2, Piccolo Forno, or even La Tavola on Mt. Washington come to mind... do yourself a favor and go to one of those!"
"1.0","Placed order and never delivered. Waited 2.5 hours and Pizza Romano stopped answering the phone? Sometimes, could hear girls talking on other end, unaware that they had answered. Only successful because it's in a city; terrible business and quality."
"5.0","Our first time here for breakfast. I had Brie and apple Crep which was delicious and my husband had madetranean omelette. Both dishes were fresh and delicious and beautifully presented. Coffee and juices were fresh. Our servers Eto and Connor were friendly. This place is clean and warm. Would love to go back with friends and family."
"4.0","The restaurant is extremely loud but the food and service are top notch. We had an early dinner for New Year's Eve and the prix fixed was amazing. We'll definitely be back to try different cocktails and menu items."
"5.0","So Jillian and I are reviewing it's amazing restaurant right on the strip district in Pittsburgh - Luke Wholeys Wild Alaskan Grill.  We talked it over and decided this was one of the best meals we've had stateside - outstanding!! We started off sharing a sushi roll with my sister from another mister, Kristen Hancock, her husband Luke and their little boy Wyatt - a roll they call the Kitchen Sink.  Yellowtail, spicy tuna, salmon and tuna - and it was fantastic!!  After that we all went into our zones and that's when amazing went into overdrive! Jillian had the ahi tuna, seared and topped with two kinds of tobego - one infused with lemon reduction that had her inhaling it. SHE LOVED IT!!!!!KRISTEN did the soft shell crab sandwich and Luke the shrimp Po-boy and everyone had smiles around the table a mile wide.  Im looking around checking out what the other tables were having - and the waiter made the decision easier for me:  I first decided to go with their Bloody Mary topped with spicy shrimp and maple bacon. It was so amazing I can barely type the rest of this review as my knees got totally week.  All of the olives, pickles and have of the maple bacon went to my co-reviewer -). After that I moved right onto the lobster bisque that was truly one of the best I ever had. Chunks of lobster crème fraîche perfectly mixed together into a fantastic warm soup on a beautiful spring afternoon.  But I wasn't done there.  Oh no, because on their menu they offer something called the steel city lobster roll - which is essentially an amazing lobster roll topped with their incredible lobster bisque as a bit of a gravy. So good, so good, so good!!!The service was fantastic, they even took care of my pups with water under the table and we all had a spectacular spectacular lunch!  Id fly back to Pittsburgh food just to eat their food.  We really enjoyed spending time with Luke himself the owner who returns out at one time lived on 89th and fifth - just a few blocks away from me in NYCBravo!!!"
"5.0","My typical go-to place open at 1AM in the morning. They serve excellent food in large proportions."
"5.0","Came here on Sunday with my friend and we got seated immediately which was awesome. This place is super cute and their menu had so many different options. Of course we went with a sweet crepe option and coffee which was amazing. The restaurant is nice because there's people around you but you can still have a conversation and hear each other too. This for sure is one of my favorite brunch spots in Pittsburgh!"
"5.0","This place is always great. Good food, drinks and friendly service. I was surprised to see someone call it dirty. I've never seen it not clean in fact it's very clean in my opinion!I'd surely recommend!!!"
"4.0","So this is not the best Thai food I have ever eaten. It is still great, though! I came here for lunch and got curry, with lemongrass soup and a spring roll. For the cheap price, the portion and quality was great! Because it happens to share a street with Thai Cuisine, there are inevitable comparisons. I've eaten at both places but I've been to TC more times and have tried a greater variety of dishes. They're both good options, but I prefer Thai Gourmet's curry to that of Thai Cuisine, which always seemed far too watery. Plus, TG has that cheap lunch special. Definitely worth checking out."
"5.0","What an amazing experience at Mezzo tonight!!!  Had the Filet and it did not disappoint.  I wanted extra sauce and they drought me a little soup bowl of a Au Jus... omg!! I'm in heaven!!  I got the Filet medium and it was perfect!!  I did not take picture but did not know it was going to be one of the best I have experienced!  Thanks Mezzo!!"
"4.0","Tired of ordering the same old catering for a business meeting luncheon so I gave Cafe Raymond a try and I am so happy I did. Everyone was very impressed with the Mediterranean Salad that consistedSpring mix, feta cheese, roasted red tomatoes, olives, capers, kalamata olives, cucumbers, red onions and Raymond's house lemon vinaigrette. They did not skimp, so if you are not a fan of any item, ask them to go light especially the onions since red onions are quite strong.  Nice assortment of signature sandwiches. Chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin and red velvet cookies were very fresh and quite the hit. Order was delivered on time and accurately."
"2.0","Let's start from the good to not so good:Good: nice decor, open kitchenNot so good: FOOD.We decided to try this place only because one other yelper thought the ramen here is better than the famous Ippudo place in NY, which I really like. As it turns out, there is no way that the ramen in Umami is anywhere close to Ippudo's. Two important elements of ramen are soup and noodles. The soup is unsavory, and the noodle is undercooked. Nothing is right about the ramen, except for the egg maybe.We also tried takoyaki (grilled octupus balls). It was okay, better than the ramen."
"4.0","I've lived in this area for three years and have never tried this place. I'm so glad I finally did. Stopped in on a Saturday morning after looking for new breakfast places to try on Yelp. It's a cute little café that offers a lot of different items - including its own ice cream parlor. I love a good breakfast sandwich and after seeing all the different options, I knew I was at the right place. I ordered the Butchie that has fried capicola, provolone, a fried egg and tomatoes on it. It traditionally comes on a bagel, but they were out. However, I got it on a croissant instead and it was SO good. I also got a hot coffee, which was also great. Everything here is homemade and the staff was super friendly. Seemed like they knew everyone that walked in the door. Will definitely come back!"
"4.0","Really enjoyed this food truck.  Hubby enjoyed his chicken taco & a carnitas taco.  Only prob is they served it on a corn shell instead of the flour.  I had the Dino bowl which was great.  I got it with the chicken and it had black beans, shredded lettuce, tomato, avocado and some type of dressing I believe."
"1.0","Got the cheesy breadsticks and the dough was raw when I bit into it. Normally I don't give yelp reviews but I've never gotten food so bad I couldn't eat it before."
"4.0","Stopped here before a show at the Byham. Service was fast, and food was solid. No complaints. We got appetizers and drinks. Great place to stop in the cultural district!"
"3.0","Being Italian I have this eating Italian down to a science , so with that said I ordered the carbonara its was more on the seafood side not the traditions carbonara but a little twist so with that said you don't always get what you want ."
"5.0","Best best best! I always get the Nam Prik w/ tofu, but lately I've been trying to expand my food horizons, so I'm experimenting a bit more than usual. I got some kind of giant vegetable-filled pancake, at a '7' spicy level, and, my god - the flavor. The deliciousness. I can't begin to describe it.Then, I discovered their lunch menu. It was $7 for lemondrop soup, an eggroll, and a gigantic plate of General Tso's Tofu, which was fried to PERFECTION and just gosh darn amazing. I don't think they make bad food here. All my experiences have been A++++++++++."
"5.0","Some of the best food we had in Pittsburgh. Small place, informal, but food was very good. As others have noted, big serving sizes (= yummy lunch next day!) and BYOB (corkage fee per person but they don't pour your wine... in which case I think it should be per bottle). This is our current go-to place for celebrations. A little more than we usually pay for a dinner but nice as a treat! They were out of several dishes the night we went, so be sure to check availability if you have a favorite."
"5.0","Best breakfast in the United States. The pancakes are incredible."
"5.0","If you're looking for a place to grab breakfast, lunch or a quick drink, check this place out! Everything is fresh and made to order. I enjoy the atmosphere inside - comfortable enough to relax and read a book - but I often get my order to go as too often I eat at the office. Anyone working on the north side (I work by the river near PNC Park) knows our lunch selection is limited. I really encourage to try Arnold's Tea for lunch as it's only a ten minute walk away. Great alternative to walking downtown, plus you're supporting local!"
"4.0","My husband and I visited Il Tetto on a Saturday afternoon. Luckily it was a gorgeous day so the rooftop was open. We were there early so while there was a crowd, it was nowhere near unbearable. We both LOVED our cocktails - one had tequila & beets, one had bourbon, balsamic and basil. Both amazing (and around $11 each), we stayed for another round. We sat at the bar and had good service, but didn't order food. The view from the balcony isn't anything to write home about but it was still a nice area to linger in for a bit. We also weren't huge fans of the roped off elevator line situation, but our wait wasn't long at all. Overall this was a great place to soak up some sun on a lovely day."
"5.0","I feel like I need a shower after I eat a Peppi's sandwich, but in a good way.Peppi's subs are so good I need profanity to fully express how good they are.Go get a Peppi's sandwich bc you need one.  Not hungry?  Excuse not valid, you need one.Did you know I can unhinge my jaw and swallow things whole?   I didnt either, until I had Peppi's.Are you hung over?  Peppi's has HEALING POWERS and will cure your hangover!Also, since I'm among friends here I will make a confession.  I do not care for Primanti's.  Somehow thats like telling people you didn't like the Godfather.  I do not like Primanti's, and Peppi's is my favorite 'Pittsburgh' sandwich.I've Peppi'd on the North Side, Dahntahn, and in the Strip District.  They're all good.  I get the Italian, and I love the dressing they put on the sandwich.Now I want Peppi's and its only 9:30 in the morning.  Damn.Just go eat at Peppi's.  You'll realize this review is just pure truth.  It's delicious, and greasy, and good."
"5.0","This is the cutest brunch spot! You'd never know from the street side there's a large/adorable balcony space with dozens of colorful umbrellas suspended 10 feet above your head to protect from the sun on hot summer days! We had a very large group and were served several large complimentary plates of fruit while we waited for the rest of our party! Kudos to the generous owner and attentive/kind wait staff for a wonderful brunch! I highly recommend the Nutella topped crepes, avocado toast and cherry omelette! Will return!"
"5.0","Awesome! Cutest  little Chinese restaurant ever. I've been coming here for years and the service and food is wonderful. Staff is very friendly, prices are fair and the portions are generous.Hands down the best Chinese Restaurant in Pittsburgh. Tucked away on a little side street in downtown Pittsburgh! What I appreciate most about the Chinatown Inn is that even when I call for take out or delivery  on a busy Saturday night they are pleasant and patient! REFRESHING!"
"4.0","My go to spot for pizza. Easy to get to from the Southside Slopes just a quick 10 min drive. The pizza here is always good and the service is spot on. I like that they have good deals on the pizza especially the XL pie. Another perk is the beer selection one stop shopping is a big plus especially when it doesn't involve multiple stops. Seating is plentiful in here and parking is easy. I can't complain it's a great spot to grab a pie."
"3.0","This is an ok restaurant I was there to celebrate a birthday and I was a it disappointed with the so so service I asked for the nicest table as it was a birthday and they sat us at the whatever table not close to the window which would have been better. The restaurant was not even full it was wed so again I don't get the lack of attention to detail Food was good noting extraordinary."
"4.0","Umami is a place that offers so much! My only complaint is the price but it's fair given what they provide you: quality, atmosphere and experience.The restaurant is kinda hidden (and exciting in this way). You have to keep an eye out for this gem. Once you find the door you have to go up a few stairs (which isn't so great if you're handicapped or older), and you'll be warmly welcomed by a host.The atmosphere is amazing. I was so amazed at the beauty and sleek design of the interior. I felt fancy! I almost felt like I was in Japan.My friends and I shared a lot of dishes family style. The most memorable food item I ate was the matcha sponge cake. Last time I checked, it was no longer available (so sad) but the other options are sure to impress you!This is definitely a treat-yourself kind of place! And more so a place for those 21+! Will most certainly come again!"
"4.0","I cannot say enough about this restaraunt! I took my mother there for her birthday and she left feeling special. The wait staff were absolutely wonderful. They were very attentive. We both ordered Halibut with a share of Lobster Mac and Cheese which by far is my favorite. For the sides we had the sautéed spinach and grilled aspargus. Absolutely delicious."
"3.0","I've really only drank here, but the bloody mary's do come with some shrimp and other sundries. Our waiter was the cutest thing, his name was Davin and he apparently does not work there any more. He was so friendly and lovely and warm. Plus he was SUPER complimentary of my friend and I, which is always a bonus.  Luke Wholey took the time to stop by our table and ask how we were enjoying ourselves. Which was sweet and well appreciated.My friend ordered some sushi which she really really enjoyed. She said it was fresh and delicious. It was a little expensive for what we got but, it seemed well worth it."
"5.0","Excellent service, food and presentation. This location lived up to the Capital Grille reputation in every respect. It happened to be Restaurant Week so that was a nice surprise. The plan was to splurge a bit anyway since we were dining to celebrate my birthday. I had the Kona crusted NY Strip, mashed potatoes, and Lobster Bisque. I also ordered the garlic shrimp as an appetizer. The steak was perfectly prepared and pretty much melted in my mouth. Above all else Capital Grill takes a tremendous amount of pride in their steaks. The mashed potatoes were excellently seasoned and had some skin mixed in for a nice contrast.  The lobster bisque was smooth, creamy and included a nice amount of lobster meat. I usually don't prefer lobster bisque but this was a very nice change of pace. The shrimp took the cake (what can I say, I love shrimp). They were huge and very filling. Only caveat is the garlic could have been more pronounced. I would suggest mincing as opposed to cloves. All in all it was an excellent meal. Can't go wrong."
"4.0","Highly recommend Arepittas as a great downtown lunch spot if you are trying to mix things up. Arepittas offers a number of specials and I tried the Best Friend special which was an arepa, an empanada, and a drink. I asked the cashier for a recommendation as I haven't eaten much Venezuelan food and have never had an arepa. I went with the shredded beef empanada which was full of meat and a pork and pico de gallo arepa. The arepa was delicious and the pork was so juicy and flavorful. At $10, it was a great deal for lunch and was quick and convenient. There were a few outside tables and a couple small tables and high tops inside."
"5.0","I really, really love Umami. I never go with more than 2-3 people, so we get seated pretty quickly even on a Saturday night. I do highly recommend making a reservation, though! This tiny place gets crowded quickly. I get the same thing every time I come in. Waygu beef, fried chicken skin, bacon wrapped quail egg, and the tonkatsu ramen. I also grab anything fruity on their rotating cocktail menu, and I'm never disappointed! The food comes out quickly, always hot and just beautiful. The staff is always friendly and lends recommendations when needed. Can't wait to go back!"
"5.0","Recently relocated from Seattle and had a hankering for sushi. A quick Yelp search led me to Umami for a late dinner with my beau on a Saturday night. The vibe (cool lighting, DJ spinnin and a buzzing crowd) was exactly what we were looking for. We ordered the chicken karaage, Sashimi platter (bleghgg to Fluke ), a spicy tuna handroll, a couple pork belly skewers (nommmm!), a beaker of Sake and the fried ice cream. All winners! Definitely plan to come back. And soon....ramen envy is real. Snaps to Dustin for great service!"
"2.0","A very inviting space, Luke's was disappointing to me on food.  I ordered the seared ahi tuna appetizer, props to this being mostly discounted due to the yelp checkin but the tuna was overcooked and personally I think the dish would be much better leaving the tuna raw because the flavor of the slaw and sauce was a good compliment.My crab cake sandwich was small and I was disappointed that they would not broil the crab cake but the waiter assured me that it was only quickly flash fried. We might have differing definitions of flash fried because there was a thick layer of fried crust which deterred what would have otherwise been a good sammy. The fries were excellent - well seasoned and perfectly cooked.  The bloody marys (although I didn't order one) had epicly sized accoutrements."
"4.0","Great lunch deal... $6-$8 for soup, spring roll and meal. Can't beat that. Panang curry was delicious! Only complaint was downstairs where the bathroom is was kind of smelly."
"4.0","My son and I met here for lunch. He had a coupon from the Enjoy book which entitles you to $12.00 off a second entree or sandwich.  I liked the atmosphere along with a small aquarium they have towards the back.My son chose the salmon entree blackened with a side of rice and broccoli. I went with the crabcake sandwich. Normally sandwiches come with French fries but for a slight upcharge you can have a salad. I opted for that since it was a hot day. We got our food fairly quickly. I had a nice size side salad which was very good. My crabcake sandwich had real crabmeat in it and I was blown away by it. So good and so filling. My son enjoyed the blackened salmon which was prepared to his liking.This is one restaurant which will automatically add 18% tip to your bill. I have heard these tips are popping up on checks in some restaurants in Pittsburgh.Very good lunch and very good service to boot. Located across from Mon Aimme Chocolat in the Strip District."
"5.0","I stumbled over Sammy's for lunch and I tell you what..  this little authentic deli spot knows how to make a great quick sandwich. They pride themselves for their famous corned beef , however they have other different cuts of meat such as pastrami salami and so on.Can't wait to go back there and try the pastrami. The sandwich comes built high (elevated) stuffed with meat and your choice of either coleslaw or sauerkraut in addition to your optional type of cheese. You can also add additional toppings. Sandwich size comes in two options half and full. They also offer lunch combos with a side and a drink for a value price.They have a full bar which I did not partake in .. As I am mostly there for lunch. The owner/floor manager was very friendly and attentive as well as the rest of the staff."
"4.0","Great ice cream. They even support local ice cream shops. They have their own brand of coffee as well. Unsure of the taste. They do breakfast as well, with only 3 items on the menu which is better than what u would expect. None the less. It's great."
"5.0","Have you ever finished dinner and immediately started fantasizing about eating it all over again? Yeah, me neither. But if I ever did, this would be the one.Food: Beyond Excellent! I immediately had my eye on the 10 oz. Filet Mignon steak and ordered one cooked medium. Our waitress recommended various marinades and rubs, but the Kona coffee with shallot butter one piqued my interest. Well, it turned out to be 'I'm going to chew each and every bite of this ever so slowly so this lasts forever' kinda delicious, tender and juicy.We also all shared an order of the Lobster Mac 'N' Cheese, which was one of the best side dishes I've eaten in a long time. I probably could have just eaten a couple bowls of this and been happy the rest of the night. Dessert was Creme Brulee topped with blueberries, strawberries, raspberries and blackberries. Words cannot express what a delightful epilogue this was to the entire meal.Service: Top-notch! Our waitress was over-the-top friendly. Although slightly animated, she was knowledgeable, prompt, friendly and resourceful the entire time. Our water glasses never dipped below half-full and she even comped one of our desserts and our post-dinner coffees. Granted, it's not a huge deal for what you pay for all the entrees and drinks (the wine list is longer than the menu), but it was not required, but much appreciated.The good news is there are Capital Grille's all over the U.S. So, if you're smart, you'll make a reservation, throw on something nice, grab your wallet (fa sho) and enjoy a wonderful evening of wining and dining in style."
"5.0","You know that Foreigner song? 'It Feels Like the First Time'... These burgers make me feel like it's the first magical time I bit into a burger.I'm almost nervous to go back. I just feel like at some point it will disappoint me. Yet I keep being proved wrong. It's amazing. Every time. Every. Single. Time. It blows me away. The best burger I've ever had... unequivocally & absolutely mind blowing.I highly recommend the Morningside Burger, with a fried egg & bacon. If everyone got to experience a burger like this, there would be no war."
"5.0","I've been here twice since I started working in the strip.  Awesome. Awesome. Awesome.  First time I had a gyro and fries, the gyro was massive, and came with a load of fries.  Everyone I talk to loves their fries..Today, I tried their BBQ chicken, with basmati rice and chick peas.  Awesome flavors all day, huge portions.  I can say I will be coming back a lot more, and I'm looking forward to trying the rest of their menu!!"
"5.0","I am writing this review with sauce dripping from my fingers!! I love this place!! I love the chicken. I love the sauce. I love the dipping sauce. I wasn't thrilled about the fries-why...because, who needs them when that chicken is so amazing!! I ordered MILD. The person at the register told me the medium is like other places hot. The mild was perfect.The line is long-but, well worth it. Go at an off time and you might not wait as long. They have seating both upstairs and down. (I got elbowed out of a seat by a very pushy woman. But, she had nothing to do with the restaurant!) Get the 3 piece strips-lots of chicken; a good hardy meal. I want to try the salad and sandwich too. All in good time. They do not take cash which I found interesting. OK...got to get the sauce of my fingers and get back to my chicken. See you there!"
"5.0","My first time coming to Caffe Mona was an overall great experience. From the time you walk in to the time you walk out customers are immersed in art/ good vibes. The servers are quite friendly, and great with suggestions. The overall feel was honestly just homey. The food was just as good as the service. The group ordered a multitude of dishes. Myself in particular got the meat omelette consisting of bacon, ham, and chicken. You think that would be too much meat, but it all balanced out with the consistency of the omelette. The Berry French Toast was fresh and fluffy.This place is great for small groups, and intimate affairs. Management is great/friendly and has a patio in the back for the summer time. I'll be back for sure."
"5.0","Delicious carnitas tacos and beans/rice. The fresh toppings (herbs, tomatoes, onions, etc) put everything a step above! Good spot to stop for a light lunch"
"1.0","Food was flavorless and very overpriced. I paid $30 for mediocre food at best. Don't even waste your time."
"4.0","I was a little skeptical off all of the 5 star reviews, but I don't think I set the bar too high for my first visit to Thai Gourmet.  The service was good and the food was good.  It was my first experience with lemongrass soup, which unfortunately isn't my thing, but I was looking forward to my pad kee mow, which was tasty and spicy.  I went with the 4 stars instead of the typical 5 because it didn't make my list of favorite Thai food.  I will be sure to check it out again and make sure my review still applies.  The lunch specials have a decent variety and the dishes are reasonable, so I'll be here again sometime."
"5.0","I just hosted a wedding shower here and the staff was excellent. I brought in decor and champagne but the tea setup they arranged beforehand was excellent. The food was great and so was the tea. Thank you Arnold's!"
"4.0","A great corned beef sandwich in a bar with plenty of character.  Small place with friendly staff.  Glad I stopped in."
"2.0","Well I stand at the hostess station while she is busy talking. The manager comes up and asked if I want to sit somewhere....well yeah....I want lunch. The waitress comes over and I order....she returns with a flat soda....not a great start. No check to see if I want refills, but the wings were ok. I think I shall pass on additional trips.  12 bucks was a bit much for six wings and a drink."
"4.0","I love this bar!  Granted it is a short walk from my house, but I still love the cocktails!  If you go in during non peak hours, the bartenders are so happy to chat with you.  I asked all about the bar and mixology.  So friendly.  I love the handmade cocktails.  Lots of fresh juices!  Great creative refreshing concoctions.  It's not huge, so on Friday or Saturday it can get crowded, but get there a little early and you can find a table."
"5.0","Cool spot near the incline just a block off of Grandview ave.Very cool cocktails with a old fashioned vibe.We had a old fashioned and a Moscow mule. Both were fantastic. The wait staff was a friendly. It takes a little longer to get your drink but it's because they hand make and take great pride in what they serve up."
"5.0","We are here from Charleston, SC all I can say is AMAZING! The customer service and food was on point."
"3.0","The service is super slow here so order a beer the first time your server comes around and enjoy your stay. I was here from out of town and excited to try this newer place. It wasn't overly busy at 5pm on a Saturday night (but it was Derby night and the Penguins were playing). Our server was hard to come by and it took awhile for her to come back and take our food orders. The saving grace was my order of Pierogi's! you get 3 large ones in an order and they are stuffed with potatoes and leeks and served with capers, radishes and mustard. Note: they will only split your bill 4 times when you have a bigger party....super weird. Since there were 8 of us, 2 of us each had to be on a check together."
"5.0","Pittsburgh has some amazing places to eat. We found this little gem. Such a sweet little place. Food and service was amazing."
"5.0","I eat here at least once a week. always busy, the staff is friendly & efficient. probably the best tacos in town. the menu is short, but simple, and I'm fine with that."
"4.0","I am definitely not the type of girl that frequents fancy restaurants. Only because I feel like sometimes they can be over hyped. However, I was not disappointed with my lunch at The Capital Grille. A few co-workers and I randomly set up a reservation 10 minutes prior to walking in the door and we were seated right away. It really is a beautiful restaurant and the service was just as I had hoped it would be. Our waitress asked us before we ordered if we were on a time constraints which I thought was really nice. It made me feel like they would be willing to accommodate us if we needed it to be a quick lunch, but we didn't. They brought out fresh bread to the table and it was amazing! It was so fresh that it was still steaming from coming out of the oven. I decided to order from one of their lunch specials which included an entree and soup for $20. I kept going back and forth between the steak sandwiches and truffle fries and the shrimp butternut squash risotto. I ended up picking the shrimp only because our waitress described it as tasting like fall in a dish and boy was she right! The shrimp were huge and cooked/seasoned perfectly and was a great accompaniment to the risotto. For my soup I almost ordered the clam chowder, but then she mentioned they had lobster bisque for an additional $5. I am so happy I went with the lobster bisque. Definitely one of the best in Pittsburgh! I would highly recommend this place for lunch and look forward to coming back in the future."
"4.0","This place had a nice setup. We tried the beers and some were better than others. Nothing blew me away on the beers.However the food was off the hook good. I'd say the food was better than the beer. I would come back."
"2.0","This place is really meh. I expected a lot more. The food is decent, though definitely not on the Burgatory/BRGR level at all. I can't really complain, decent service as well. But the real hook is: The food is TINY, the burger patties are like 4 ounces. And the sides are all tiny as well. And the prices are insanely high for those tiny sides/burgers. It's just completely not worth it. 2 people with 2 burger meals and a single appetizer should not cost upwards of $60. We have sooooo many better options around the burgh. I suggest stopping in once but repeats are just a drain on the wallet. Go to Burgatory, BRGR, 5 Guys, Wahlburgers, Stack'd... all better value and better tasting."
"4.0","I came here without a reservation and was able to find a seat at the bar before the bar was too busy too order food.If you would like to dine, then I recommend a reservation.For appetizer, I had the Lobster Bisque soup by recommendation of the bartender Michael. He was spot on with his recommendation. The soup was excellent. I cleaned the bowl with the warm bread we were given.With his credibility established, we ordered a few other of Michael's recommendations: the Sirloin, the Porterhouse, and the Lobster Mac'n'Cheese. The steaks were the portions which they were advertised to be. Furthermore, they were both cooked to medium-rare as we requested; however, the outside of the steak was a bit too charred in some portions which led a few bites to be a little too ashy for the cost of the steaks.The Lobster Mac'n'Cheese was surprisingly good. It was topped off with a crunchy ingredient to complement the lobster and macaroni which gave the dish an interesting texture.All of Michael's recommendations were spot on, and he was very friendly and attentive throughout our meal. Michael's co-bartender, Seth was also very friendly. The two also knew many of the patrons by name further demonstrating how friendly they were. The two were also quite knowledgeable of all of the drinks which were available.If you are in Pittsburgh and looking for a steakhouse or upscale bar, then the Capital Grille would be an appropriate destination."
"3.0","So I was really excited to try this place with my girlfriend!  You walk upstairs and into a beautifully adorned room. People bustling, drinks flowing, open kitchen. The food that we had was good. My favorite was the ramen bowl. Here's the thing. For this type of place, you really need a server who will make suggestions, explain things, and ask you what you like, to really give you the full experience. Unfortunately, we explained that we had never been there before and that wasn't enough of a cue for her to explain things. She looked like she just wanted to take our order and not be bothered. As we looked at the menu, she came back and saw that we had several questions, but never made suggestions, and almost made us feel like she was judging us for our questions. At the end of the meal she just brought us the bill, and we had planned to stay for a couple of drinks.  Oh well, we just went across the street to Grapperia, where they were happy to explain things and serve us. Lackluster experience solely on our server. Prob wouldn't go back."
"5.0","This restaurant is the best find I've been to in a long time! The baked Gouda appetizer is amazing. It's sweet, has balsamic and I think sun dried tomatoes or something tangy like that. The Ahi tuna portion was large and done perfectly with a wasabi topping that was excellent. The cod special was also excellent and lots of flavor. The tomato basil soup was not to our liking. A bit too light and thin. The flourless chocolate cake and the lemon cake were unusually good, and they make their own pastries there. Actually, these deserts were uncanny good. They're also a BYOB, an added plus. Our waitress had the best personality and was a lot of fun. She's worked there a long time and knew the items well. Blonde grad student. Will definitely be back soon and often! I highly recommend this place."
"1.0","I loved this place but they just got hit with a consumer alertafter an inspection turned up more than a dozen serious food safety violations. Today is June 20, 2017.Details linked here from the Post-Gazette and are available from the Health Dept. so you have to decide for yourself.http://www.post-gazette.com/business/healthcare-business/2017/06/20/Beta-Bites-inspection-consumer-alert/stories/201706200107I'm rooting for them - I hope they pull it back together."
"1.0","Pizza was left outside, delivery driver never. Called. The worst place ever when I called grub hub to get a refund they told me they would have to speak to this place. Has to throw the food away, never never again, let's hope they  make this right"

"5.0","My favorite place for nice and friendly breakfast!!! The food is excellent! Crepes and walnuts are great! Very recommended! Waiters are super nice!!!"
"1.0","I was hoping to have a nice dinner with my family on vacation. I've heard so many great things about this restaurant but I was so disappointed. Darla greeted us then all downhill. No personality when I asked what steak she recommended she named 2 and walked away. Never said why she recommended them. I was ordering a bottle of wine and asked about 3 different kinds and she just said the most expensive but with no reason. Although I heard her in conversation with the 2 men next to us that may have been regulars and wondered why she would not be the same with us I then asked about the appetizers to see about getting some conversation that was authentic but she just said 'it depends on what you like are you ready to order?'and had no suggestions. We ordered the garlic shrimp and Caesar salad. Garlic shrimp was so bland it was a waste of calories and Caesar salad was average. She never came over to ask how everything was and when we didn't finish the shrimp she just took it away and never asked why. Steak was good but definitely had better and the salmon was average . Sadly I can say I've had a better meal at Houlihans and the service at the Capital Grille was below average. I'd never waste my money there again."
"4.0","So I was pleasantly surprised by this place when I arrived. I thought this was just a little coffee shop that served simple breakfast items such as bagels. Boy, was I was I wrong. I had no idea this place had a lovely deck out back with rainbow colored umbrellas.  This place was very inviting and the staff was super friendly. I came in with my husband on Memorial Day for brunch and opted for the outdoor seating area.  Their menu was quite varied, and ranged from your typical omelettes, to some really intriguing sweet and salty crepes. They had a $20 brunch special which I highly recommend, you can pick your choice of fruit or salad, your entree, followed by one of their sweet crepes: nutella and banana, strawberry and apricot, or feta and honey. I opted for the salad, the Philly crepe, and the feta and honey desert crepe. We were served their coffee with is some strong delicious stuff, I usually have a ton of coffee when it's unlimited, but I totally met my coffee quota here. Really good stuff. The food itself was excellent. My salad had some spring greens and sliced tomato with this incredible creamy vinaigrette sauce. Despite the simplicity, it was excellent. My entree was really good, it was basically a cheese steak filling, with roasted peppers, caramelized onions and Gorgonzola cheese. This stuffed crepe was enormous and quite delicious. My husband had the Mediterranean omelette which had olives, roasted peppers, onions, and feta. This omelette was really well balanced and I loved the tang that the feta added.  For dessert, the honey feta crepe was really good, not overly sweet. Excellent desert.  Overall I was very happy to stumble upon this place. I can't wait to return, especially since you can bring your own Champagne for mimosas!!"
"4.0","Have been going to Pamela's forever. Always a reliable go-to for breakfast. Service is polite and expedient without being rushed. Never disappointed. While no one every went here because of the decor the recent remodeling is ATROCIOUS absolutely AWFUL. Positively UNAPPEALING. Professional help is available. Seek it."
"5.0","Their catering trays are the best I've ever had! I loved everything. It was all fresh and tasty from the salads, moist chicken with spinach, strawberries, etc., grilled bread...so good!"
"4.0","Have been here 3-4 times and it never disappoints. I always usually go with the special or whatever the staff recommends that night, which has traditionally been steak. I have had a couple really well cooked steaks from The Capital Grille. The prices are expensive and you can pretty much assume that you will be paying $100/person easy after drinks and an appetizer or desert. It is however very very good. If you are in town do your self a favor and go grab a steak here."
"5.0","Wonderful food, good atmosphere.  Excellent potatoes and hotcakes.  Best restaurant breakfast I've had in a long time."
"5.0","These tacos were DELICIOUS!! Decently priced and the service was fast! Will definitely be coming back!"
"5.0","Such a cute place, had a great coffee shop vibe. The food was absolutely incredible, especially for a moderately-priced shop. We went for brunch and each ordered a crepe. Highly recommend! Different than any crepe I've ever had before. Great service, very friendly and nice staff. The coffee was ironically my least favorite thing, but nothing a few sugars couldn't fix. I will definitely return!"
"4.0","Spouse and I wanted lunch while we explored Pittsburgh waiting to catch a ball game.  This place came recommended but a way long wait and not the cleanest place I ever saw - plus tables and people jammed in - we wondered why it would be so popular.  Then we ate the food - fantastic diner grub - the real thing including a gruff but sweet waitress.  We would go back despite the jammed noisy ambience"
"5.0","Um hello delicious, fresh burgers! I've always been curious about this spot and decided to stop in for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. The place was totally deserted which I find crazy now knowing how good their food is. Pro-tip: go on a Tuesday afternoon! You'll get your food super quick and it's a super relaxed atmosphere. Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and explained that their most popular burgers are all named after neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. They have two sizes of burgers: a craft ($13, regular sized burger) and a mini craft ($10, a little larger than a slider). All burgers come with a side of fries or mixed greens and you can upgrade for $1 for rosemary fries (THE BEST) or $3 for pierogies, mac and cheese, or slaw. I opted for the Fox Chapel craft burger, which did not disappoint. The patty is their #theblend, which is half local grass fed beef and half sautéed mushrooms. If you like mushrooms, go for #theblend, flavorful but not overpowering. The burger was topped with goat cheese, mixed greens, pickled onion, avocado, and a balsamic reduction. It seems like all their burgers are served on a potato bun, which I didn't love, but it was still tasty. Now, let's talk about the rosemary fries. These are totally, without a doubt, worth the $1 upgrade. My mom hates French fries but could not get enough of these. Their fries are hand cut, too, which is a score in my book. Overall, I think this may be my new favorite craft burger spot in the burgh. Love that all their ingredients are fresh, and most even locally sourced. Aka you'll won't feel gross after eating their food. I didn't have a brew, but they have a huge craft beer selection, too. If you're not in the mood for a heavy, in your face Burgatory burger, definitely hop over to Lawrenceville to Burgh'ers."
"4.0","I ordered dinner from http://www.mealsdelivered.net/ from Chinatown Inn. I got chicken and cashews for my wife and Lamb for me. It is the best Chinese food I have found in Pittsburgh. Great ingredients  and taste. I intend to go there for a meal real soon. Highly recommended unless you have a ticket to NYC, SF or Hong Kong"
"4.0","This place is fabulous! I came with a small group of colleagues and luckily I got to try quite a bit of items from the menu. The bartender was awesome. He had a lot of good suggestions and was very attentive. We moved to a table and received good service. Our server also had a lot of good suggestions. I would recommend the stuffed mushroom, the burrata, rosemary gnocchi, and (my favorite) the mushroom risotto."
"4.0","Nice chilled place. Great attentive service and food (I came for breakfast, got the bagel) hit the spot. Nothing else needs to be said"
"4.0","It was that time of day where you wanted lunch and a coffee. Well, I wanted lunch and a coffee. I'm a frequent flyer of Starbucks since it's close to my house, but I'm also a huge fan of local businesses. I've never been here and the first time I passed it I assumed it was an ice cream place. The parking situation kind of sucks because it's along that main strip where there's construction and turning lanes. All you really have right there is curbside parking that's usually quick to fill up. I found a spot though!Upon entering I noticed it was bigger than I imagined and the space was inviting/clean. There were tall round tables to the right and near the window there were two to three spacious tables situated. They have a lot going on in terms of menu items. There was breakfast with extremely friendly prices, sandwiches, coffee, muffins, buckeyes (I got three and they were huge and delicious!), lemon bars, cupcakes. They of course have ice cream as well, but I didn't see or sample any this time. There were two friendly ladies helping two of us out.I grabbed a bottle of water, got a tall vanilla latte, and a Milano sandwich. The total for all three was $11. I really enjoyed the sandwich and my vanilla latte. The combination of flavors was just right and the sandwich itself was a good size cut in half. I'd love to try their ice cream. There were only two things I wasn't a fan of: When you walk in there is a noise to let people know someone walked through the door. It wasn't like a ding...a bit lengthy and annoying. Another sore spot was the steamer whenever someone ordered a latte due to how obnoxiously loud it was. Maybe it appeared loud because it was quiet or something with the space being smaller, but I don't recall ever hearing anything so loud when coffee is being made. Just my take though and not something that would take away from the great spot."
"5.0","Can't say enough, the bartenders know their stuff and with some insightful questions can come up with a cocktail that perfectly fits your taste or a beer you've never had but will be on your favorites list from thereon. The menu is small as this is first and foremost a cocktail bar and a very cool little unique one at that, but everything I've ever eaten here was very, very good and usually a nice twist on something you've had, but done in a way that just seems to make it better. When everything is good on a small menu the menu feels bigger. You won't be sorry you came to this neat little pub."
"5.0","The Maggie's Farm burger is amazing...now know why it is so popular! Rosemary fries are perfectly done and very tasty! Great variety and a very eclectic offering.  Coming back to try more!!"
"4.0","Had the big roast beef. It was surprisingly really good. Great bun! One of the best fast food meals I've had. The staff was very nice and energetic."
"5.0","This place is great for a quick quiet breakfast with friends or by yourself. The on street parking great and it's hidden gem that needs to be known. I love walking in and seeing Pete."
"3.0","My parents were in town and since my Mom's birthday is next week we decided to go out for an early celebration.  I now live in Bloomfield so we decided to go Italian.  Full disclosure:  my first choice was D'Amico's but either they changed their storefront and I didn't recognize it, or they have closed.  In any event, my plan B was Alexanders.We went on a Tuesday night around 7.  Parking was no problem, free street parking after 6-nice!  The bar was deserted and the small dining room had two or three small groups.  So no shouting to make yourself heard-double nice!  The seating was comfortable (we got a square table in the middle of the room).Our server was very nice and efficient and I'd give her at least 4 stars.  My mom got the spinach and cheese ravioli w/ marinara sauce (on the menu the ravioli are deep fried but they honored her request for a 'normal' cook), my dad got angel hair with bolognese sauce, and I got linguini with pesto sauce.I was surprised that the pasta dishes did not come with a salad so if you go, that's additional.  The server said that the serving sizes were generous.  They were good portions but not huge by Pittsburgh standards.  My mom does not have a large appetite and she ate all but one ravioli.  I ate all my pasta and could have had more.  My Dad was reaching for his third slice of bread after he polished off his pasta, so I'll let you draw your own conclusions!  :)  The sauces were good and the pasta tasted like it was fresh.  Everything was warm/lukewarm, but not steaming hot.  I'm a bit of a slow eater, especially with pasta so by the time I was finishing, it was cold.The food was OK, in cases like this, I really wish you could give a half star, because this is 3.5 stars.  Nothing was horrible, nothing was excellent.  It was good.  The bill with a tip was around $55 (we all had soft drinks), which again I don't have a major quibble about.Not sure I will go back, but not sorry I went.  :)"
"3.0","I have not been back. But, others have told me how wonderful the owners are.  So, I feel like I need to give them another chance.  When I check out, they are always very kind.   I feel that I should not be passive aggressive which is easy and my nature, but deal with the problem directly and speak with the owners; not aggressively but to solve problem or better understand it. I know that my experience is due to cultural difference. But, could you just delay me ten minutes due to biases and not  forty-five. That would be the difference between 'I'm ok. I get it. '. And being furious. Ill let you know if I am adult enough to speak with the owners and the outcome."
"3.0","Food was pretty good, service was great and I loved the atmosphere.Way too hot in the restaurant! We were sweating the whole time we were there. Also, they were out of sushi rice when we were there so we were disappointed that we could not get sushi."
"5.0","There's so many different ways I could start but the easiest is probably to just say that Luke Wholeys is everything you could possibly want from a seafood place. I know that this may sound cliche but everything was 5 star, top notch. The atmosphere was nothing short of perfect, from the nautical decor to the flowing layout, the restaurant matches the name to a T!We walked in shortly before noon on a Sunday and were pleased to find a cozy high top on the bar side. The server greeted us immediately and informed us of the daily specials and the menu was absolutely amazing. We got a spicy tuna roll and exclusive crabstick sashimi. Both of which were full of flavor and versatility. I recommend the blackened catfish sandwich or the Baja shrimp po'boy, you will not be disappointed.This place is normally full on a weeknight or weekend so I suggest making a reservation. Get here now don't wait another minute."
"4.0","I had a wonderful experience at this restaurant bringing 8 out of town guests from across the country. The food was outstanding and the wait staff is very accommodating. Alex made a special effort to make sure our time there was enjoyable. Good authentic Italian cuisine at a very reasonable price."
"4.0","I'd really like to give this place 4 or 5 stars for the pizza, and a 1 for service.  I've had nothing but terrible experiences at this location which is a damn shame for Upper Lawrenceville.  The fact that I keep going back should tell you how much I enjoy the pizza. Issues I've had with staff include but are not limited to: 1) Randomly closing the doors on us AT LUNCHTIME and not letting us in when we could see that there were customers inside (this has happened to me TWICE) 2) Aloof and rude employees not acknowledging when I'm standing at the counter and they're too busy chatting. 3) Downright lying about the ingredients in the sauce because they were too lazy to fix their mistake and remake the pizza that they messed up. (they put pesto sauce on my pizza when I asked for white garlic. My significant other called them out on  this, informing them that I have a nut allergy and pesto will kill me. They still wouldn't admit their wrongdoing or remake the pizza)4) Just today, an employee skipped over my sister and I in line and rolled his eyes at us because we wanted salads (which were small and terrible by the way).  He angrily shouted 'okay who here is gettin' a pizza?!' without addressing us further than the initial eye roll. He then filled the next customer's order and proceeded to take 5 minutes to shuffle around and slowly pull out salad bowls, which were not hidden, but in plain sight.  Even though we ordered standard salads off the menu, he made us tell him what to put on these salads, and rolled his eyes even more when we told him to add garlic, because that meant he had to pull out a knife and cutting board. Long story short, there's a reason that this location is rated 3 stars versus the downtown location which is currently rated at 4 stars.  If you're in Lawrenceville and you want a delicious, quick, cheap pizza, be prepared to deal with dishonest, angry, aloof employees (there are a few good employees, but they're far outnumbered).  Oh, and don't bother with a salad.EDIT: CHANGED MY REVIEW TO 4 STARS FROM 3 BECAUSE THE SERVICE HAS IMPROVED."
"5.0","The atmosphere is fun. Good music and the option to play games- which is always a good time. I love the layout and am excited to come back when the weather gets nice (they has glass garage doors). They serve you a glass of water as soon as you sit down. I ordered a seasonal drink but got to try two of the mixed drinks and both were delicious. Another fun fact: phone charger cords are setup under the bar for patrons to charge their phones at any times."
"1.0","Horrible. I thought we were getting some good pizza in the hood, but instead got horrible pizza, miserable, miserable staff amd subpar ingredients. You are going to make pizza in a dominos style oven? come on. No ingredients listed? a sauce that tastes like paste? And nasty employees? nope. Don't bother; Too many other places to try. I don't know who owns rhis place, but they need a do-over."
"1.0","THE WORST IN EFFICIENCY!!! My coworkers were seated upstairs as I stood downstairs for over 25 minutes as they preparing my Brown Bag Special. PRICING WAS INACCURATE!!Their website claims it's 12.75 and in the actual restaurant it's more expensive. LACK COMMUNICATION!!I called prior to order my food and told them my coworkers were there but never prepared my food and heard my request wrongThe purpose of my visit was based upon my peer recommendation and literally my experience was nothing less than terrible!"
"4.0","Delicious and reasonably priced! Long lines for the food truck but was glad I waited! The Beef Bulgogi was tasty.... next time will try the pork ! Tofu options for vegetarians!"
"5.0","Per usual, anywhere we visit I yelp restaurant reviews which is why we came, and this 'unique find' actually surpassed my expectations!! First contact was friendly parking advice on phone, (easy as could park anywhere on permit only street if for 1 hour as posted). Arrived to nice background music inside with decor that even my husband remarked on accented with brick and nice seating. I had a latte, my daughter a cappuccino, husband an americano coffee and we all thought each was delicious and frothy. The owner whose name I forgot to get was very accommodating; didn't hesitate when I asked for soy milk or when my daughter was undecided on what to order (trust me too many delicious sounding choices!) I had a really good omelet with Gouda, portobello mushroom and spinach, my husband also thoroughly enjoyed his Nutella with bananas on French toast and my daughter had Berries and cream on thick French toast. Yes, she took pictures of our food. Yes, the service was excellent. Yes, there was nothing I could improve upon. (I am sure I have never said this in a review) We cannot wait to come back to this delicious,  relaxing find, when my daughter moves up for grad school come August. Highly suggest you check it out. Btw, we are from Florida but I posted this while here..."
"1.0","A couple of group came after us was able to get their food before us.  So of course we asked the server and she said it's because our group was to big. It doesn't justify that we had to wait for an hour for the food and never came back to refill our water.  So we all left...Without being apologetics she was just rude."
"4.0","If you've ever been to a custom personal pizza place, you know what you're getting! Everything is fresh and the service is fast. I didn't have an issue with the service, and both men who attended to us were kind. The pizza was good, but not amazing. I like that you can really load it up with a lot of toppings because I feel like I'm eating a more balanced meal. Another plus is that they have fresh mozzarella and prosciutto, which many unlimited topping places don't!"
"5.0","I absolutely love this place, so much that I've decided to finally write my first yelp review. First off, every single employee is friendly and goes above and beyond. Second, their sandwiches. For $4 their breakfast sandwiches are the same price/cheaper than other places and are insanely fresh and delicious. Get it on a croissant, it's amazing. If I'm not mistaken they bake their own bread here. The other sandwiches are great too, especially the one with the artichoke spread. The coffee is great (they can make any flavor latte you can think of) and from a local source. Third, they sell fresh from the farm juices at exactly what you'd pay if you went down to the actual place. This place is legit and has some of the friendliest service I've seen around."
"5.0","Yes, it's a chain, so yes, it might be fun to go to a more unique, dedicated Pittsburgh steakhouse.  The fact of the matter though is that this is probably the best steak in the city.  The menu depth and service is always fantastic - have been here countless times and have always left very happy."
"4.0","Eat'n Park has always been a neighborhood diner to me but it is so much more than that which I found out thanks to a prior Yelp event.  My husband and I went for dinner the other night as I was in the mood for fresh veggies and their well stocked all you can eat salad bar does  the trick.  They have rotating soups and I had a cup of chicken noodle as well as creamed broccoli (soup of the day) which was fantastic.  I piled every topping possible from bacon, olives, beats and cheese on top of my salad.  They have fruit as well as muffins and breads for sides.  The menu is pretty extensive and my husband went with a grilled flatbread pita type sandwich with chicken.  We saved room for dessert as it was $2 pies for the month. The Oreo cream pie with massive amounts of whipped cream was decadent and I ate every bite.  My husband was pleased with his banana cream pie.  The service was quick and we were in and out in less than hour."
"5.0","Great food, excellent service. George was great. Recommend the pulled pork sandwich it's a side of Mac & cheese."
"2.0","They may have updated the resturant but every time I go there is always hair in my food. So, I usually get one of their pies and skip eating there."
"5.0","Wow! That's what I have to say about their 'Hot' sauce, Wow! I can't get enough of it. Whatever sauce is left after the wings, I dip the bomb-ass breadsticks in. Yummy Yummy Yummy. They have great specials and the girl that usually answers the phone is super nice."
"5.0","Thai Gourmet is the bomb spot. Good for dates. Good for friends. Good for takeout. Good for eating in. Good for solo lunch. Good for everything. The food is a perfect comfort without sacrificing flavor, and I've never been disappointed in any order I've placed.Sometimes people I know who don't like spicy will order something less spicy and it will come out very spicy, so be careful dealing with their 1-10 scale. This doesn't affect me because I don't care about spicy, but it is still something worth knowing.Because I'm both a total sucker and also a white dude who grew up in the woods, while the Thai food here is incredible, the more Americanized comfort food is what I tend to go for. Crab Voluptuous, Wonton soup, and General Tso's chicken. If you're a vegetarian, you can get General Tso's tofu. If you're vegan, you can get Vegan General Tso's tofu. Or if you're not a sucker, their Thai food is delicious, too."
"5.0","Went for an early birthday dinner. We had the calamari with peppers as a starter with a basil gin martini and the bohemian all very good. The bohemian being the best out of both drinks. Not over sweet like many like it. For the main course we had the 22 oz Porterhouse steak and the Chef's Choice Filet Mignon with mushrooms.   We picked the Lobster Mac and Cheese and the Tomato, Basil, Mozzarella salad for our sides.  All excellent.  For dessert we had the cheesecake and the coconut cream pie.  It was a struggle at this point to eat a single bite more,  but it was so good we pushed through the pain.Service was top notch and classic high end American style.  Everything came out quickly but at proper intervals.  Lucky for me the manager was a co-worker at a previous job and made sure we were well taken care of.  Definitely worth the $$$$ (dolla dolla bills yo - as Yelp says)."
"3.0","One of my favorite fast food options, they are inexpensive, fast, and the ingredients are good. There's a dining area where you can eat in or you can take it to go.You can choose the kind of dough (whole grain, regular or gluten free), sauce, toppings and finishings. It's unlimited toppings, which is a great deal, plus it adds variety. It's an assembly line, and everything is made while you watch and per your instruction. The staff is friendly and helpful."
"5.0","I've been here for breakfast and lunch several times now and it does not disappoint.  They offer wraps and sandwiches for breakfast that cost maybe slightly more than some of the chains downtown, but it's simple, fresh food that tastes really good.  Lunch is even better.  Some of the sandwiches are pretty good, but I tried a Pinkman wrap and was amazed! The grilled chicken in the wrap was fresh and cooked perfectly, and the BBQ sauce and chili lime aioli gave it so much flavor. Definitely worth the price!"
"5.0","This is a must visit spot when in Pittsburgh. I have been coming to this city for years and just learned about the tasty delights of this bakery. The almond and the chocolate almond croissant are amazing!"
"5.0","My fiancé and I are here for Pittsburgh dinning week and it was delicious. The steaks were cooked perfectly. We got the mashed potatoes as a side as well as the green beans. The mashed potatoes were creamy and had great flavor. The green beans were ok but I think they could of used a little something more or extra flavor. We got the cheesecake for desert and it was absolutely delicious. My fiancé for the espresso cake and the coffee flavor was strong but I could of used a little more sweetness for my taste. It was good but the cheesecake was great and we will definitely get again. The wait staff was amazing. They also bring a variety of bread tot he table as well. It came out hot and fresh. The butter they serve with it has added spices. We also got drinks at the bar before dinner and they didn't have a lot to choose from but my cosmopolitan was good! Highly recommend. We will go back for sure."
"5.0","This review is specifically for the dinner that I enjoyed in the apartment above Merante's Gift Shop.I have stopped by here twice now for dinner, both times with a group of 8 people.  The first time that we ate here my wife and I were both unsure of where to go.  We hesistantly headed up the stairs next to the shop into the apartment above which thankfully ended up being the correct place!  The apartment consists of a couple of rooms off to the right where you can mingle and eat your appetizers and then the kitchen a bit farther down where we have always had the rest of our meal.On both of our visits we have started off the evening with 6 different appetizers.  This last time around we had meatballs, a tuscan loaf of bread covered in spices, a cucumber salad, stuffed mushrooms, roasted vegetables and a stuffed tomato.  My favorite of the bunch both times was the tuscan loaf covered in spices.  After you finish up the appetizers you are invited into the kitchen where the rest of the meal is served family style.  First up at the table was our soup which was a minostrone genovese.  Maria, the main cook, suggested that we add some red pepper flakes and some parmesan to it which gave it some extra flavor and the little bit of kick which I loved.  Whenever we were finished with our soups, ricotta gnocchi was served to our table with a red sauce made with pork and beef simmered in red wine and tomatoes.  What is nice about this place is that Maria is very accomodating to food allergies.  Since I am not able to have red wine, they made a special bowl of the gnocchi for me with a san marzano sauce.  It was really good and I loved how light and fluffy the gnocchi ended up being.  Once that course was finished we were presented with a crown roast of pork on one platter and winter vegetables on another.  The crown roast of pork was quite impressive and the 8 of us had a hard time finishing even half of.  The vegetables were also good here and I was sad that I had filled up as much as I did as I was not able to eat as many as I would have liked.  There was also some green beans with tomatoes and olives floating around which is pretty much the only item of the night that I didn't really care for.  While I normally love green beans, they tasted of the olives that they were cooked with and so it wasn't for me.  Of course with all of the other food on the table I didn't even really care and I know its something that I normally would not have ordered at a restaurant.  The salad was served next after the main course.  It consisted of apples, pecans and cranberries over Romaine and was topped with their balsamic glaze dressing.  It was really good and I especially loved the large granules of sea salt (Maldon perhaps?) that were on it which helped to make it taste extra good.  Last but not least was our dessert which was Chocolate LOOOOOOVE Cake.  It consisted of chocolate custard, chocolate cake and chocolate Mousse.  Since chocalate is the other food besides red wine which I am not able to enjoy, Maria was nice enough to make me a cinnamon cannoli for dessert.  While everyone was enjoying their chocolate cake, my dessert was brought to the table and was greeted with an audible sigh from some other members of our party that they were not getting the cannoli also.  As we were finishing our desserts Maria produced a decaf espresso for anyone that wanted it.  It had a nice orange flavor to it and was very good.  When all was said and done, all of the substantial amount of food that our group did not eat was packed up by Maria and set aside for us to take home.  Everyone ended up leaving with a fair amount of it.The bottom line for me is that we will be back here again in the future.  As a matter of a fact we already have our reservation made with the same group for July.  Beyond that my wife and I are trying to get some family together for another time.  If you are looking at trying to eat here I recommend that you book early because as of early Februrary all of the weekend days through November were already booked.  The only other thing to note about this place is that it is BYOB."
"1.0","Went to grab a late night drink here with my friends. Ordered the round from the bar and then tried to sit at one of the many empty tables. We were stopped by people who worked there and were told we were not allowed to sit at a table because we order drinks from the bar. The bar had no empty seats so my friends and I ended up having to stand in heels next to the bar which was like 3 feet away from a whole row of empty tables. It was ridiculous and the bartender had an attitude. Won't be back again."
"4.0","Tamarind is the best place to get Indian food in Oakland! Their menu has South Indian food (dosas!) which I was impressed by. We ordered the bread basket, chicken tikka masala, paneer/aloo saag, Mysore dosa, and madras masala dosa for 5 people on a Saturday night and it was the perfect amount of delicious food for just $10 each. Each of the entrees comes with a side of rice, but I highly recommend getting a side of naan or a bread basket as well. The dosas were pretty tasty but I preferred the madras masala over the Mysore dosa because the potato stuffing made it more filling."
"4.0","I don't get lunch in town often but every once in a while I have a meeting there and need something that's quick and not pizza. Freshii was suggested to me and it was a very nice surprise. I ordered Buddha's Satay. It arrived quickly and was both filling and delicious. The crispy wontons added some nice texture while the peanut sauce had just enough of a kick to it. My only disappointment was that there were not more options with soba noodles. A 'build your bowl' option here would be fantastic!(ETA: I clearly missed that there IS a build your own bowl option. Thanks, Jeff. Will check it out next time!)"
"4.0","Good food and good vegetarian options..!! Have been here several times and I really like their Bisi Bele Bath.. reminds me of home and is really the comfort food!!  They should really consider having buffets in the evenings and introduce few other dishes.. their menu has not changed in a really really long time!!"
"1.0","Very weird place. The Indian owner kept circling me and stood right behind me every time I went to get more buffet. I don't know why anyone would do that I guess buffet was the wrong business plan mate."
"4.0","Service: it was definitely not the best experience we had a a restaurant. We went in on a Friday night at 7( I remembers because I happen to have a reminder set up on my phone for 7pm) ordered almost right way. Didn't get our food at 8pm. We looked around, there are some tables, sure, it's Friday but the place was not that packed. I would say 1/3 of the table was empty. So glad we ordered two appetizer, and they came out in a fair amount of time. But our waiter kept apologizing but still can't keep up. Didn't refill our drink for a long time, take him a while to get a beer from the bar etc. two words for the service,  sincere but too slow!Taste: appetizers were ok, we had the fried chicken and fried goat cheese ball. Fried chicken was too salty for my taste but the rest of the friend liked it. We all think the goat cheese were just ok, average. But burgers were great! I forgot which one did I get, but we had 4 different kinds and every one of them were excellent!"
"5.0","I used to come here wt my friends for brunch, it's been a while since I did my last stop. They changed a lot of things here.. they have crepes, French toasts, bagels and much more.. too many delicious options... the place is cozy, European and so nice to hang out.. one of the most beautiful back patio absolutely at Caffe Mona.. must see"

"4.0","I'm giving Wheelhouse four stars because of the lingering cigarette smoke from the casino. Nothing can be done to get rid of it.Besides that, we went at 4pm on Saturday for a drink and apps. No drink menu so you have to ask and guess what you'd like. Service was quick, accommodating and friendly.I got pierogi nachos(pierogis in cheese sauce, tomatoes, red onion, sour cream and chives). The wine served came filled to the brim. For the sports fan, there are tvs EVERYWHERE!"
"5.0","I'm so hungry right now, and all I can think about are the delicious apps here. Omg feed me."
"5.0","Best tacos I've ever had.  Mmm.  Me and a friend stopped in for lunch and we had ordered and received our food in about 5 minutes.  We split nachos (I didn't get meat on them, looking back I wish I would have) and we each got 3 tacos.  You get to choose corn or flour tortillas and they have beef, pork, chicken, and veggie options.  Tacos were $3 each.  Service was friendly and the small store is my kinda vibe.  I will certainly be back!"
"5.0","I feel like most Japanese restaurants don't have Tare as an option, so I need to point out that Umami definitely has an amazing variety of food. This place is unique and has some of the best sushi you can find in this town.I tend to make my own Tare platter when its an option and as you can see from the picture I posted, I was most definitely happy with the food. I highly recommend reserving a table for a fun date night (the app they partnered with isn't the easiest to navigate but its worth knowing you have a reserved spot at this hard to get into restaurant)."
"3.0","Authentic Thai, at par with Thai Tamarind and Smiling Banana as three better than average Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh. 3-stars because the red and green curry are sweeter than they should, and use canned sweetened pineapple that spoils fresh taste. The Duck curry and fish cakes are excellent. The summer rolls are always a delight."
"3.0","Their 'vegan option' is just taking away ingredients leaving you with a very sad $5+taco"
"5.0","We ordered boxed lunches and some afternoon snack platters from Sausalido for a small 100-person design conference. Delivery was early, and the quality was amazing. I took home some leftover veggies that I was still eating, just as fresh, a week later. Sausalido was professional and responsive, and offered amazing, healthy options at a reasonable price. The cheeses on the afternoon snack trays were to die for, and the boxed lunches were anything but boring. Everything was fresh and delicious. We were delighted to work with them and I can't wait to do so again."
"3.0","The view and overall atmosphere during the summer is definitely enjoyable and there aren't too many other happy hour spots that offer this (could be why most of the business casual population can be found here at night). Despite that, the service on the roof is abysmal. I truly don't believe that staffing is the issue. These people simply might not care at all. You stand and wait 15-20 minutes without being served as you flash your card right in front of their faces and try to get their attention. I would tip you a lot more if you'd actually pay attention. I paid $18 after settling for two green tea shots (I find it difficult to believe you're completely out of Red Bull when the other two levels under Sienna are dead).I believe that the experience could be improved overall. Train your bartenders. It's to their own personal benefit to provide decent service."
"5.0","We have eaten at Salem's a number of times. The food is quite good and the prices reasonable. There are dishes featuring goat, chicken and various vegetables. I especially recommend visiting during Ramadan for their Iftar buffet. Seating is family style at long tables. Other diners were friendly."
"4.0","We ordered Rialto's for pickup last Friday, not wanting to bother with cooking after a long work week.  The prices are about what you'd expect, but if you can get your hands on a coupon or a code from AllMenus, then it becomes super cheap - we got a large pizza from $8 due to a coupon code.  So look into that!It was ready when they said it would be, and we brought it back to our apartment, ready to dig in.  We'd ordered a large 'Rialto House' pizza, which is under the specialty part of the menu.  We opened the box to discover a mass of fresh toppings - pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, and olives.  After a quick warming-up in the oven, we dug in.I have to say, the toppings really make this pizza.  Sure, there's sauce and cheese under there, but neither to excess.  The toppings, however, are plentiful and high quality.  The peppers were fresh and crisp - I even enjoyed the mushrooms which I usually loathe.  And they weren't stingy about piling them on - nothing is worse than paying a lot for a pizza and then having to hunt for the few lonely pepperoni slices.  You pay for toppings, you should get a bunch of them.  The pizza wasn't oily or greasy either.We really enjoyed this pie, and would definitely order again.  I think if you're in the mood for greasy, cheesy goodness (which we are, from time to time), this is not the place.  But if you want a fresh pizza loaded with toppings and not loaded with grease, I'd recommend Rialto!"
"2.0","Interesting establishment. The food is a 3/5 but the restaurant as a whole is flawed, how can you make someone pay nearly 3 dollars for sweet tea / lemonade and not give a refill? It's interesting how they establish their meal structure as well seeing as though they are almost 3 separate items if you want a drink, food and side. The only dipping sauce they have is their house sauce which is a weird spicy mayo??? Definitely could've had some ranch or bbq in my opinion. Loud atmosphere which I love and their table placers are very interesting and effective. Hopefully this place will grow and stay in Oakland, hopefully expanding upon refills and sauces choices in the near future."
"4.0","Cute place!  We got the lager and witbier, both were yummy. Friendly bar staff. Only thing that could make it better is outdoor seating."
"5.0","I was at the Capital Grille on business with coworkers and customers.   I keep kosher,  so I brought my own catered meal.   The manager was very helpful getting it warmed up and served with the rest of the party's food.   A real class act.   I saw what my colleagues ordered,  and everyone had clean plates.   The presentation was impressive,  and the quality of the meal was well received.   Thank you for a great evening."
"5.0","Came here after eating downstairs at the round corner cantina. The hostess suggested take a peak before heading home, so we took the trek up two flights of stairs. The entrance to this restaurant is hidden on the side of the building and could be easy to miss. When we got up the stairs, I was presently surprised at the atmosphere. there was a live DJ and trendy pink neon lighting and the place was packed. I decided that I would be back here on my next happy hour. Came back for happy hour on a Friday afternoon around 5pm and it was not as packed so there was plenty of seating. ordered a few appetizers to get a feel for different things. I ended up ordering the deviled eggs, Miso Soup and the smoked salmon sushi. ALL AMAZINGLY GOOD! next I ordered, broccoli and a raw salmon and raw scallop sushi (each came as one piece). Not normally my thing to eat scallop raw but it was good. drinks were excellent too. Asked the bartender to make me something that tasted like Asian pear, which normally isn't on the menu but he made something up. Great staff. All very nice."
"5.0","Fantastic find!   Great beer & amazing food!   Cool atmosphere with chill vibe.  Really interesting food combinations....the pulled pork sandwich was to die for!   The spicy fried chicken sandwich was also amazing.  Brussels sprouts and fries were so good!   Service was also top notch. Leah was great !   Highly recommend!"
"2.0","I hate to leave  this kind of a review but the food here had no taste at all in my opinion. I felt like this was something that I could've made at home in my own kitchen.I ordered the smoked pulled pork bowl which did not come in a bowl but merely the basket that they serve the tacos in lined with paper. The pulled pork was tender but had no flavor the black beans tasted like they came straight out of the can. There was not one sign of onions or cilantro in the whole dish. It wasn't until I ate the guacamole that some flavor actually came out. Maybe I should have added to guacamole to the entire dish first instead of eating it on the side. I was really looking forward to the pico de gallo being spicy and flavorful but again I was disappointed. If I ever go back to this place I'll be sure to bring my own seasoning's."
"5.0","Must must must haves! What a delicious pizza..  Amazing service... Original flavor  kudos to the chef."
"4.0","My boyfriend and I were looking for a reasonably affordable-nice-restaurant to bring his cousin and we chose this place because it was BYOB. Actually, I lied. We had no idea it was BYOB until we walked in because I choose restaurants based exclusively on their yelp photos... But it's BYOB.We ordered the Brussels sprouts appetizer to split across 3 people. It's cheesy, something we didn't expect.They ran out of duck and trout (daily special) so we got pork chops, swordfish, and salmon instead. My boyfriend's cousin said the salmon was a 4.8/5 stars because the feta on top was delicious.My boyfriend said the swordfish was good. I ordered the pork chop and thought it was well cooked and juicy. A little bit oily for my taste, but good nonetheless.The service is very generous and the crowd is very relaxed. I highly recommend everyone to come here!It was very good"
"4.0","Best supreme pizza I ever had in my life! Highly recommend it, though price is a bit steep"
"5.0","I've been there twice and both times was great. My coworkers also frequent the business on a regular basis.  The guys behind the counter are super friendly and helpful if you have questions.  The chicken tikka masala is excellent!"
"5.0","I've been here a time or two for drinks and liked it. My husband and I have been here two times to share food and try some cocktails, we were extremely pleased both times! Awesome drinks we had include: Donny Darko & the cucumber press, we had more that I can't remember, I'll update when I do, they were all amazing. Awesome food: GET THE DUMPLINGS! The wings, amaaaaazing smoked Gouda Mac n cheese, & black bean hummus. We had more, but I can't remember! Bottom line, every time we've been there everything we ate and drank was GREAT and the service was always good. They have games there you can play too! Me and the hubby got comfy at a table the one time and played trivial pursuit and ate and drank and had a great time! We WILL be back!"
"4.0","Absolutely fantastic. My favorite stop in Pittsburgh. YUM. The atmosphere is comfortable and cozy, beautifully and vibrantly decorated. $3 might sound expensive for a single taco, BUT I PROMISE ITS WORTH IT. My only gripe is that every once in a while when they are busier than average, my tacos can get a little sloppily thrown together and my specifications to my order are ignored, but that is totally forgivable when you've got a line out the door and down the street. In any case, I try to make a stop at least once every time I am in town, and I'm super thankful to my friend for introducing me to this place!"
"5.0","I'm sitting in the car immediately after leaving Federal Galley and I have to post right away because it was just THAT good. I had the roast beef enchiladas with hatch green chile sauce and have never been more full from stuffing my face with deliciousness."
"3.0","This place is good for one or two occasions, but after having gone there once a week for the past two months, I'd definitely say I won't be craving Indian food for a while. The price is fair for the buffets, and the food is good, but the taste just all melts together after a plate in, and the spices can't be differentiated. The staff is friendly, and the ambiance is intimate."
"5.0","Doce Taqueria is an excellent, relatively inexpensive place to get your taco fix in Pittsburgh. The service at Doce is fast and the people are friendly. The overall concept is excellent as well, making use of the small space available to give the effect of being in a genuine Mexican eatery. But the best thing about Doce are the tacos themselves! Made with authentic and fresh ingredients, they serve a selection of vegan, beef, chicken, and pork tacos complete with a range of toppings. The tortillas are also freshly made and are perfectly prepared every time. If you're looking for a place to grab some fast and tasty tacos, this is your spot."
"4.0","Stopped in the Smallman Galley for lunch.  Was looking over the menu's of several places and noticed the Hog Hogie on the glass case that separates the kitchen from where you order.  How could I not order that Hog Hogie.  When I was ordering someone nearby said that was their favorite item.  Anyway, the Hogie was really tasty with an apple mustard sauce and it came with a very good broccoli slaw.  Will return to try some of the other items on the menu."
"5.0","From beginning to end this meal was fantastic. Atmosphere of this restaurant was fancy, but casual at the same time. Wait staff were very friendly, had great knowledge of the menu and worked their tails off to make sure my table and the tables around us were taken care of. My date and I had sushi, the mahi mahi tacos and the Baja shrimp and day-boat scallop dish. Our food was phenomenal. That's all I'll say about our food. My date and I are looking forward to going back soon. Great experience!"
"5.0","Amazing tacos and burritos. All the ingredients are fresh and made right in front of you. I go once a week for my fix."
"4.0","I just went to Sammy's yesterday before a show at Arcade Comedy Theater and it was the quintessential Pittsburgh dive bar/sandwich shop and probably something like what Primanti Brothers used to be.Sandwiches were tasty and everything was cheap. The atmosphere was awesome -- dark and kind of grungy with 80s arena rock playing and Iron City on tap. I felt like I had been transported back to 1988. Would recommend."
"1.0","The chicken sandwich was a 5oz portion of chicken thigh pressed down. All fat and no meat. Bun and dressing used to cover up the poor meat quality."
"5.0","Don't be put off by the decor in this place- their food is legit! I personally have had their cheese steak, hot Italian, and fries. Their bread is good, their meat is delicious, and their fries are FRESH not frozen. They're made to order, and perfection. Two people can easily share a small fry- the portions are generous. If you've got a hankering for a legitimate hoagie/sub, head to Peppi's. You won't be disappointed."
"4.0","A very nice neighborhood restaurant with a touch of class. Went for lunch and had the London Broil which was a very nice sliced flank steak over risotto. I made a comment that I thought it was a bit rich which I meant that I would have a hard time finishing. Apparently someone overheard and the chef came over and asked if I would like him to remake it or the sauce.  The other person in my party had the roasted vegetable wrap turned roasted vegetable sandwich as they were out of the wraps. She said it was very nice.Service was good. I think this place is a keeper!"
"5.0","Very good food! Highly recommended. Probably the best breakfast in town! Had the special Italian Style Eggs Benedict. The rest of the table had omelets and croissant sandwich. No complaints."
"5.0","Chinatown Inn is one of my favorite places to eat in downtown Pittsburgh.  And also for about 10 years has been home to parties on the 2nd and 3rd floor hosted by The Humanaut Crew and sometimes others.Chinatown deserves 5 stars just for their carpet alone: http://www.flickr.com/photos/soulglo/2969694288/Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is real.  If you ever get the honor of being at a party upstairs, you would get to see this yourselves in all its majesty.That said, the food is good too.  Much better than any other place in downtown and it is worth the trek across downtown to eat there for lunch."
"4.0","I was so excited to try this place after hearing the chicken is as good as Nashvilles! The place is definitely promising. The chicken is made really fresh and very juicy but crispy at the same time. I would recommend the tenders or the sandwich. They add a tangy sauce with pickled veggies in the sandwich that really balance out the flavor. I would say the medium is a good spicy level for those that love spicy but dont want to go too overboard. But I did hear that the spicy is really good too! I would say the only disappointment was the fries. They werent flavored well and kind of stale. Hopefully it was just a bad batch... anyways I will be back and would say its a good local place for some delicious fried chicken. And that sweet tea reminds me of the south FOR SURE!! Recommend!"
"4.0","Yummy burgers and fries served on mismatched China plates. The mini burger comes with a generous serving of fries. The rosemary fries are topped with fresh rosemary. The seating area is kind of loud, so maybe don't bring your elderly grandparents during the dinner rush."
"4.0","When I am at the casino, I love to eat at the wheelhouse. I have had a few things here in the past but the last two times, I have ordered the portobello mushroom sandwich which is so good. First time I added chicken and the second time without. They are both good. It's has this brown gravy like sauce on it which makes it really flavorful. I definitely recommend the fries with everything on them as well."
"5.0","Always great! Delicious meal!  Waitress was super nice.  We had family from out of town.  They too loved Pamela's!"
"5.0","Abrigada!!! We loved this cafe! The bifana sandwich was delicious - spicy & juicy on a crusty Portuguese bun! The nata tart reminded us of the tarts in Belen (near Lisbon). It was so good that we placed a to go order after we ate to take home to my Portuguese Italian Mother. The staff were all so friendly & helpful! I had never been to this neighborhood, but now I want to return for the Azorean Cafe & to check out the other shops.  I highly recommend a visit!!!"
"3.0","When you have friends or family visiting in town, and you want to show off Pittsburgh, Il Tetto is the perfect place to kick off the night. Just as a warning, it is sometimes difficult to get up to this space. The host desk will direct you to an incredibly slow elevator in the back of Emporio to get you up there. I repeat, the elevator is so slow, and if you're with a crowd, it's going to take a while to get up there. When the weather is right, this place is a gorgeous spot to see the city. From the deck, you get to see the city from a new angle, and it boasts a great view of the river.  Early in the evening, the rooftop bar has a laid back vibe. There have been times I've gone later and it has been crazy up there, and impossible to get a table. The draft list is fun, but overpriced for even craft beer lovers.I've been to Il Tetto several times, but only eaten there once. The food menu is small and overpriced compared to the first two floors of the Sienna Mercato establishment. We ordered several small plates including the meat & cheese, and house-made pork rinds. Neither were worth writing home about, and while I enjoyed the view and draft list, I don't think I'd eat there again. This place is perfect for a drink and a view before you head off to somewhere better to eat."
"1.0","Worst service ever... rude, you're on a time limit when you are seated and advised of it multiple times. Will never return and will tell everyone about it."

"4.0","Excelent Pizza, Love their monster pizza.  Like some of the others have said its not the best tasting stuff around, but its good for your average pizza place.  I just love their price on the monster pizza that feeds a party of people :)"
"4.0","favorite is the chicken sandwich(medium) with a side of fries. Also has the chicken salad. Good portion size with a reasonable price."
"1.0","With a party of 13, our waitress read us the happy hour specials and then turned our well drink orders into Jack and coke / Captain and coke and charged us $30 more than she should have. The GM backed her up and they wouldn't refund our money. When I went in to speak with another manager, he was rude and wouldn't even listen to my side of things. No refund, just a couple of gift cards instead. Very unhappy with their management."
"5.0","I don't even know if I have the words to describe how awesome-sauce my Sausalido catering experience was for our wedding, but I'll give it a try!  Every step of the process, from tasting to day-of, Nick was professional, friendly, and no-nonsense.  We told him upfront what we wanted to spend, and he gave us amazing food and service at an even MORE amazing price.  He also didn't try to nickel and dime us like so many vendors involved in the wedding industry try to do.  Nick let us know immediately of different price options (for example, how much more colored linens are compared to black) and even gave very helpful suggestions on what we didn't need to spend money on (buying our pop rather than have a caterer provide it at an inflated price).Because our venue did not have a kitchen, all the food was made at the restaurant and brought over.  I worried about food drying out, getting cold, etc. - all for naught as all the food was the perfect temperature and moist.  Much care was taken with the display of food, including mirrors and flowers to accentuate and complement what was to be served.  Nick also worked with All Occasions to rent the plates and silverware, using his industry discount to again save us a few bucks.  He was even nice enough to bring all the ice we needed for the beer and pop!As if all this wasn't enough, Nick was actually at the venue the day-of and oversaw the set-up process.  This was very reassuring and also shows how much he truly cares about producing a quality product and service.  So many of our guests raved to me about the delicious food.  I give Nick and Sausalido my highest recommendation, and I know I will select Sausalido again for any future catering needs!"
"4.0","I have been in to Arnold's Tea twice.  Both times, it has been a good experience with a peaceful ambiance and enjoyable tea.  The first time I had a peach apple cobbler iced tea, and a few months later I returned to try a vanilla black tea latte.  The first time I also tried a brownie, which was large and filling.  However, I have never tried any of the sandwiches or other lunch food, and I'm not sure if I will... they seem a little expensive for what they are.  But it's worth a trip out just for the tea and the atmosphere.  Despite how open the space is, it still manages to have a cozy feeling, and the service is friendly."
"4.0","Food: fresh chirashi. The shrimp and veg entree tempura was very crispy. However, it could become too oily for one person(even two people) to finish all of it. Recommend to share it among more than 4 people. The environment was very nice. Good for conversation."
"1.0","Absolutely horrible! Wing night was a bust, they were flavorless and over fried,  dry as a bone. Several people actually walked out. The music was way too loud and the sports were missing from the 'atmosphere'.  The only good thing was the beer was cold."
"3.0","Our 3rd time here...First things first, the food was phenomenal which is what matters...however this not the best experience overall. Our server was kind and attentive, however, seemed overwhelmed and did not recall our appetizer order (asked 3 times if we wanted one after ordering) resulting in a cold batch of arancini (still delicious while cold though). The overall atmosphere of this place is awesome but their seating arrangement leaves some to be desired. Unfortunately tonight, we were stuck next to (fairly close) a very loud and vulgar group of people who were also very 'nosey' into our conversation and what we were doing. Luckily, they left pre-salad. Our meals were great but I'd forego the copious amounts of 'remoulade' with the crab cakes. The cakes themselves were very light and flavorful. Large chunks of crab and overall a fantastic plate paired with the Asiago Risotto. As our night wound down, it seemed that the entire restaurant staff did too. We had a prolonged wait for our card to be processed for upwards of 15min after declining dessert. The staff seemed to have already closed down as we finished, making us feel hurried and unwanted. Upon leaving the restaurant, we also realized that our server failed to provide us with our leftovers that we had asked to be packaged (we weren't walking back, it was -10 degrees). The employees were in quite the hurry to finish their shifts. Saulsilido - you're lucky your food is top notch, otherwise I'd be concerned."
"5.0","Great food! The carnitas is so well cooked. Tacos are pricy but everything else is cheap so it balances out."
"4.0","Great topping choices, and they let you really load them up! Service could be a little friendlier, but it may have been an off day."
"4.0","A relaxed cafe with a nice selection of brunch plates. Highly recommend the Spanakopita French Toast with the Nutella Hot Chocolate.The ambience is perfect for a relaxed Sunday brunch. The pinboard of currency notes and other wall hangings could help you spend the afternoon here"
"5.0","You guys if I could have the tacos and sauces injected in me I would. Edgar's is in my top two places for tacos in Pittsburgh.Everything is fresh. Always fresh. The flavors are so aromatic. I swear I get dizzy from eating this goodness. One bite and my head spins. Have to grab a quick seat to maintain my composure so that I may continue to inhale those tacos as though I've never eaten before."
"5.0","New cafe in the neighborhood. Great spot, really nice owner who is clearly very thoughtful about the dishes she creates. There are lots of homey touches of local foods from her hometown so lots to explore. I got a breakfast omelette and my husband got the pork loin sandwich. Both delicious! Would definitely go back."
"4.0","Fernando's is that place downtown that you walk by on multiple occasions and you just don't notice it.  I can't really tell you the reason why you would walk by this place without giving it a second look, nor can I explain how I came this far in life without noticing it before.  It looks almost exactly like all other pizza joints located within the Golden Triangle with the same selection of food offered.  Not quite sure why it flies under the radar, but it really shouldn't.I think the thing that sets this place apart is the quick service that is presented with a smile.  I walked in during festival time in full swing and they did not falter at all.  I ordered my food, went to the cooler to retrieve my drink and by the time I made it back to the counter my food was ready for me to chow down on.Pizza is pizza, when you crave it you really want it.  This really hit the spot when I was tired of walking and needed to fill my energy tank so I could keep going.  Not too salty, sauce was great and the crust had that thin crispy crunch you like to hear when you bite into it.  Being on Liberty Ave downtown makes for some great people watching as well.  Sit back and you kind of get a meal and entertainment all in one.  Definitely a place to stop for a quick bite to eat if you are downtown."
"1.0","I have been to Bettis' grill before, but it was about 5 years ago, and I enjoyed myself. However, this time was an epic fail. When we arrived, the hostess was pleasant and we were seated immediately. When we got to our booth, the seats were ripped up and had food crumbs everywhere. We got our menus and there was also food stains on the menu!Already, it was not such a great start with the presentation of uncleanliness. We ordered our drinks, and when the drinks arrived, our server said they ran out of straws. Ummm ok.We had other friends meeting up with us at the restaurant. When they arrived, my one friend was trying to order a drink. And the server either did not know what the drink was, or he kept saying they ran out of that particular wine. Soooooo frustrating. Our food did arrive in a decent timeframe. I ordered the deep fried burger and fries and split it with another friend. I will say the food was good. My other friends didnt complain about the taste of their food either. But thiis place just seems to need a lot of work in proper set up and having their products available. You should never be our of so many things. Even our ketchup bottles had no ketchup in it. We asked our server for more ketchup, which never came so we had to grab one ourselves from an empty table.  Management needs to pull this place together! They are about to send it down the drain if this keeps up."

"4.0","I've been here a few times. Can't beat five dollar Coors Light pitchers... The crowd tends to be black. I tend to be white. And obviously from out of town. People are friendly. It's just a neighborhood bar. People talk to each other and have a good time. The food is well priced and good. The music is going to blow your ears up, if you care about that, don't come."
"5.0","Hands down! New ownership brings that place a lots of positive things. Now the place is very fresh lots of atmosphere specially back patio is rainbowy 'woov' and very attentive service. The omelets were so yummy. We had veggie and steak omelet both were excellent . We enjoyed our coffees too.This Cafe Mona experience was totally different than others. Give them a try highly recommended."
"4.0","What a hidden gem and unique experience! I've driven by this building so many times and never thought twice about it, however after it was continually recommended to me I decided to venture in. The inside is nothing fancy, no frills, or much warmth. Set up cafeteria style. But the food is so good and it's an amazing deal! I've been twice so far and had the chicken tikka masala over rice, and it was the best. I also got the warm naan bread to go with it and the spinach as a side. All three exceeded my expectations. The second time I also got a piece of the baklava, and I will say I've had better baklava. But maybe they were just having a bad baklava day because someone brought me a piece in the past from there and it was A+. So I'll be giving the dessert another chance next time! I split my meal both times with someone else and we still could not finish it because they give you so much. The people working there are also so nice. They are willing to answer any questions and let you sample the different items on the hot bar. I look forward to my next delicious meal."
"4.0","I had a very enjoyable afternoon here with friends. We had beers and snacks and sat upstairs in the loft area and played games. They have a variety of board games and card games and Jenga available up in the loft area. The chicharrones with beer cheese were delicious. My friend got the pierogies and did not care for them. Overall a great spot."

"3.0","This place is not too bad actually. It's definitely a rickety store front, but the food is not bad - you can get a small pizza with good toppings for a pretty good price. Not sure if you can get single slices, but you can get these personal pies. Not the best pizza you'll ever have, but if you're in the area and are pretty hungry it's not a bad option."
"5.0","Out of this world. You can't go wrong with any choice. Don't let the long line scare you. They move very quickly. Great selection of both sweet and savory. Also, the nitro cold brew is a great addition if you want a chilled coffee."
"4.0","Fairly new but their beer is good and the spent grain chicharrones are fantastic. Menu is the most interesting we've seen at brew pubs in Pittsburgh. Look forward to visiting in the future."
"4.0","I ate here a lot due to its proximity to CMU. The food is almost always good, though there were a few misses. The desserts tend to be a little too sweet, or rich, or dry. The salads are very good. They had a tuna melt which I practically lived off of since it was big enough to make two meals, but last time I checked they took it off the menu. I would avoid the pizza if they have it."
"5.0","Great little taco stand. Tacos have a great authentic taste. And the atmosphere makes you feel like your in a small little Cali food stand."
"3.0","The best diner option in Pittsburgh is to get on the turnpike and go to Jersey. Pittsburgh diners close at 10pm and the menu is bigger at McDonalds."
"5.0","Five of us came here for brunch on a Sunday based on my recommendation. The place was hopping. The food was amazing. I had been dreaming of the bloody mary with everything and it did not disappoint! The bacon was caramelized and sweet. The soft shell crab was freshly made, warm and crispy. The shrimp were cold. The olives firm. The celery crunchy. All was delicious!!! I also had the fish tacos. They were good but I could not eat both after the raw oysters and Bloody Mary. I can't wait to return next time i am in Pittsburgh!!"
"1.0","Worst service I've ever seen. Place was pretty much empty just before lunch. Took 30 minutes to get drinks and about the same to get food. Food wasn't anything better than perkins. Asked several times for mayo and ranch but had to go up to the bar where they never even approached me so went to the front desk server to ask. She brought back mayo and forgot the ranch. By this time I didn't want to ask again."
"1.0","Me and my 5 friends when to this place and spent $420.00. It took over an hour to get entrees and when we did get them the fish was dry, scampi was disgusting. The food had no flavor. Scallops were full of sand.I told them that the scampi was horrible and I thought they would  at least remove it but they left it on bill. Waitress said sorry manager didn't want to remove it. Never again!!! Expensive for nothing"
"5.0","Stopped in during lunch to check out their Pittsburgh Restaurant specials. I had the roasted chicken and potatoes, which were out of this world. Our service was outstanding and timely, which was very impressive because they were very busy during the Friday lunch rush. Please make sure to grab some of their cheesecake for dessert, it was scrumptious!!!"
"1.0","Tried to get delivery from here to Troy Hill and they refused. I called once and gave my address and they confirmed they would deliver.  I put together a very large order and called back to be told they only deliver within a 3 mile radius and we were 3.3 miles away. I asked if they would please make an exception and even offered to pay an extra fee only to be told the delivery driver refused. Never again!! Not nice people and zero customer service!"
"2.0","Even with the low rating, this is the only place I get pizza from in Oakland. It's just sort of like a tradition; no other pizza shop can compete with the Antoon's large plain pie for less than 5 dollars.Get the garlic crust. It's not on the menu, but they'll prepare your crust with some extra spices and flavors which makes you think you're eating something delicious instead of cheap."
"5.0","Blueberry ricotta pancakes were so yummy and very filling. Parking sucks but this place is worth coming to despite that. Industrial but cozy and very friendly service. Came on a Friday just before lunch and there was no wait. In from out of town. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a tasty and satisfying meal!"
"4.0","Back home for the holidays and checking out all the new neighborhood places. I love that this business is black owned. They have a vast variety of teas and I decided to get the matcha chai tea latte. They have about five different varieties of chai which I thought was interesting. There are many teas to choose from and they also offer a good menu. The space is very big a nice place to come and study or do work. My sister wanted to rent it for her bridal shower and they offer that. The only thing I would say is they should give an explanation of the different types of teas maybe in a smaller brochure. My sister who works at teavana said they used a lot of tea than is needed so they could save more money by using less. They also had honey and other items from local businesses. Other wise the service was great. It did take a long time to get my order but it was busy I won't knock them for that ;-)"
"5.0","Fantastic burger!!! Not a bad deal either. Staff is really friendly and the fries are crispy and delicious."
"1.0","Being a regular and going to Redbeards for over 4 plus years, I didn't see this coming, but then again. The change of management once again, I ask him which tv will have the Dallas game on, he said he didn't know, then he came and said the one at the other end of the bar, now mind you they have always had the same 3 games on both sides, so I ask to speak to the owner who I know and he said to me wrong ain't changing no tvs and again I ask to speak to the owner, he went over and talk with him, then the owner came over, I said you always have the same games on both side of the bar he gave me some BS answering saying he can't change the channels once they are set cause they ask people earlier where do they want to seat and watch the game, which is BS, like I said I've been a regular for 4 plus years and I know the routine, the bartenders put the stickers up on Saturday nights before they close, smfh, all I can say is WOW, didn't see that coming, but I guess as an business owner you have no LOYALTY to your customers nor regulars!"
"3.0","I had the Blood which is basically a blood orange vodka like drink. However I'm not sure if it wasn't made right or what because the after taste was extremely horrid to say the least. It has a very hipster vibe to it also. I'll def try it again."
"5.0","Been in Pittsburgh over 3 weeks and this is by far the best lunch I have had so far.  For 20 is bucks two adults and 3 kids were well fed.  Not to mention, the food was Great.  Had the lamb kaba"
"5.0","Have ordered from this restaurant (through Wheel Deliver) many times but had never been to their 5th Ave location until last week for lunch.  Very pleasant atmosphere and a wonderful buffet.  An efficient and polite waiter kept our glasses filled with ice water.  It was a good experience which I hope to repeat soon."
"1.0","We were visiting the city...walked into the restaurant at 10:30 on a Friday night and were turned away because the hostess quite obviously wanted to go home soon..very rude and will not be going back..too bad."
"4.0","Small, clean, little, family owned and operated. I stopped here for breakfast as I waited for my car to get fixed and I was delighted to have a good breakfast for what I paid. I hung out for about an hour, ownership was friendly with every customer and clearly happy to serve their repeat customers. This place is perfect to pick up a quick lunch, or breakfast on the go as the name eludes to. My favorite part of this place is that the prices aren't trying to be anything more than fair and the chef/staff is more than willing to make any substitutions or alterations to your order for you without a problem. I mean, this isn't going to be the best you've ever had and it doesn't try to be. It's the equivalent of a to-go diner, but the attitude of the ownership/staff and the variety of options makes this place a reasonable option should you be in the area. It makes you WANT to give them business. Great for a quick bite any day of the week."
"1.0","Should a customer have to wait an hour for (mediocre) food? And within that hour no apology for the delay? And not proactively be offered a price comp for inconvenience? Should that customer then be made to feel bad for spending too much time in a restaurant (hmm i wonder if that would be attributable to an hour wait for food?) And then be told to leave for not wanting to pay for her meal? These questions remain unanswered by Caffe Mona management after my dining experience this weekend. Unfortunately the good vibes of a post yoga workout meal  and opportunity to catch up with friends visiting from out of town for homecoming weekend was tarnished by lack of quality customer service. Instead of admitting to a mistake or apologizing for a delay, my sister was repeatedly told 'your food will be right out' - i would guess 3-4 times over the course of an hour. Meanwhile management monitored the back kitchen while watching a football (US American Soccer) game on TV and only came out to see why some of our orders were mixed up and perhaps figure out why we were sitting around with mostly empty plates - well all but one of us that is - since finally after an hour WE had to inform him one of us had still be waiting to be served.Fast forward a day later - the same group convenes at Gipettos in Lawrenceville for great food, great vibes, awesome service (with an apology for an insignificant 'delay' in some of the food).Long story short - Caffe Mona is not worth it."
"4.0","Great late night sushi spot with interesting atmosphere.  There was a DJ the night we were there, which was cool, but not conducive to conversation.  The fish was fresh and expertly prepared/presented.  Will definitely be back!"
"4.0","This place has two and a half stars?!?! What!!  My favorite spot downtown. Great staff. Great food. Great drinks. Yes, it gets busy and loud, but it's so fun. We love all three floors of this restaurant and visit more often than we should. I always take my out of town family and friends here!"
"4.0","Really enjoy this place for a quick breakfast or lunch.  It is nice to have a somewhat healthy option when you are in a hurry.  I say somewhat because even though they use fresh ingredients, many of their meals are not the best calorie and fat-wise.  Either way though they are delicious.  On top of that the workers are all super friendly and helpful, even when you are asking annoying questions at 7am.My favorite breakfast item they have is the spinach, mushroom, and goat cheese egg pocket.  This is actually a pretty healthy item, but you would not know it by the taste.  All the flavors come together perfectly and it makes for a great and filling breakfast.  For lunch my favorite is the buffalo wrap.  It comes with greek yogurt ranch which is very good."
"5.0","When in The Strip there are so many 'must see' shops and restaurants, but the consistency of Luke Wholey's restaurant keeps this brick and mortar at the top of my list. This restaurant does it all. Established in 2012, the full service restaurant and bar is complete with an oyster and sushi bar as well. The menu has every type of seafood under the sea, and a huge variety of lunch and dinner entrees. From simple fried cod sandwiches, to decadent Baja shrimp scampi linguini, to lighter fare salmon and beet salads, starters like lobster bisque soup, shrimp cocktail, an entire sushi menu, and even burgers, I would imagine there's something here for everyone. Being a vegan my go-to is always vegetable sushi and their side house salad - a generous portion of greens, carrots, cucumber, cherry tomato, red onion, topped with house-made croutons and their house-made salad dressings. Sounds simple, but it's perfectly delicious, always hits the spot, and is always fresh as can be. Their full bar menu always has a great selection of draft beer and bottles, with lots of local brews in the mix. If you're ever in the mood for a Bloody Mary and you haven't yet tried theirs, Wholey's is THE place to get one. My boyfriend cannot get enough and has yet to find one, in and outside of Pittsburgh that holds a candle to theirs. Option to get yours topped with a slice of bacon, shrimp cocktail, or go big with the fried crab. Aside from all the food and drink being top notch, the staff is so cheerful and eager to serve you. In the warmer months the retractable windows/doors open and some tables are right in the fresh air. The bar area is nice and open with several TVs, snag an empty seat if you see one! This place is always bustling, always packed with people, but that means they're doing something right. Great experience, great service, great food, what more could you ask for. Looking forward to my next stop in!"
"4.0","Despite the mixed reviews here, I decided to give Little Nippers 2 a whirl since the bf wanted lasagna, and I read a few positive reviews of the lasagna here. I ordered that plus 6 Hot Wings and a Vegetable Calzone. The meat lasagna was a large portion and just above average in that Chef Boyardee kind of way (like Kat M. said). The calzone, though, was outstanding with fresh mushrooms, fresh broccoli, fresh zucchini, spinach (either frozen or cooked), and more.I also loved the hot wing sauce. Though the wings were not as crisp as I prefer, the sauce made up for it (I got the un-breaded wings). Delivery time was as advertised and the driver delivered with a big smile.Extra points for being on GrubHub."
"5.0","Edward, the host and my waiter, was quite charming and attentive. He was able to make wonderful recommendations, has impeccable timing and manners, and ask while flying seemlessly and effortlessly to all of his appointed tables (all this while hosting simultaneously! ).        At Edwards recommendation I started off with the gouda and also some red mussels, followed  by a house salad with very excellent balsamic dressing, and the crab cakes.      The chef  (Mike I believe the waiter said his name was) and his kitchen help have left nothing to chance.      The gouda was inexplicably delicious, while not being too filling. The red mussels are to die for, especially the exorbitant sauce.       The crab cakes, served on a bed of risotto, we're without a doubt the absolute best (more crab than cake with the risotto cooked to perfection.        The fresh cheese cake, served with fresh strawberries, blue berries and a caramel reduction, was an absolutely wonderful way to end the meal.      If I had any complaint, it was that the portion sizes were a bit large. However, they make for an excellent selling point for any date night.     All in all the quaint, intimate atmosphere, combined with the delectable apps, entrees, and desserts; and of course the fabulous service....makes this a must for all serious and nonchalant foodies or casual diners alike.PS I would definitely make reservations Thursday through Saturday, and request to be seated on Edwards section.  He was phenomenal!!!!"
"3.0","The pizza itself was very good.  Cheesy and greasy and it surely hit the spot when I needed to satisfy my hunger.But, there is always a but, they need to update their menu on here.  The prices are way off.  From what we ordered according to the menu listed here on Yelp, and what we paid when the food showed up, was really quite a bit difference.  Asides from that, I couldn't see much else to fault here.  Or maybe that was because they made a mistake in my favor and in order to rectify that they gave me a free small pizza."
"2.0","Can't say I'm terribly impressed by this place, although the umbrellas in the patio are pretty cool. I came here with a group of friends and we were all pretty underwhelmed by both the options on the menu and the quality of the food. Additionally, the prices are pretty unreasonable for the area. One of my friends discovered the cheapest way to get full was to order two bagel sandwiches rather than a bagel combo. I also couldn't wrap my head around the salad dressing they use -- it was way too acidic and really overpowered my meal. I guess the eclectic decor in the patio somewhat reminds me of my time in Paris, but in a cheesy way. Probably worth checking out if you're in the area due to a lack of other hipster brunch places, but I don't see myself returning anytime soon."
"4.0","We had a very good brunch here. The food was fresh and the space is really cute. It was really busy, but we were able to get a table right before the main rush came. I had a breakfast sandwich and my friend had a chicken sandwich. Both were made fresh with fresh ingredients and were delicious. The service left a little to be desired. They were very busy so I'll cut them a little slack. But the server forgot my coffee and was MIA for probably 30 mins. I ended up asking another server who got it for me right away. I will definitely return- very cute cafe/breakfast place in Bloomfield."

"5.0","Absolutely fantastic.  We stopped in here on a Saturday because we were in town for another event  - since it's the Holiday Season, the pay lot up the street even had free parking.  Bonus!  Unfortunately, they didn't open until 5 PM, so we had to wait a couple minutes beforehand, but it was well worth it.  We were actually the first ones in the door.  I'm not going to talk about the ambiance/setting - others have pretty well covered this.  The kitchen was a little slow with our food, but the tableside service was still good.  I can't complain that much about the kitchen - as soon as we sat down, 5 other tables filled up right behind us.  While others got their appetizers and meals before us, we didn't mind because their food seemed a little less complicated to make, and I can understand the restaurant's approach of trying to make as many patrons happy as fast as they can.  But we did wait at least 30 minutes for our orders to come out (hence, the one star deduction).  Again - well worth the wait.  I had the Curry Goat; super flavorful; my only complaint is the amount of bones that came with it.  My dining partners had the Chicken Makhani (with tomato & cream sauce; it was delicious), and the Chicken Saag with spinach.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  The waiter came over and even asked if the spiciness was OK,...as if he could read our minds, especially since one of us experiences chronic indigestion.  She was fine throughout the meal and even after.  They were out of Naan bread, so they provided us a couple orders of other dipping bread, perfect to sop up all the leftover sauce.  They didn't push drinks on us; the water was fine and was refilled several times over.The big question:  would we go back?  Absolutely.  Even through we live about an hour away, we agreed we would drive that far just to come to this restaurant and try out more items."
"3.0","Large & fast but they forgot my toddler's food.If you've never had a toddler, this is one of the worst possible things that could ever happen that doesn't involve death or dismemberment. resulting commotion sounded a lot like death &/or dismemberment, though.Two year olds are awesome, FYI."
"5.0","Great prices for the portions, absolutely delicious food, and a wonderful family-owned atmosphere."
"4.0","I love this place! It's the epitome of hole in the wall and it has a cafeteria style setup. Even though it looks run down, I think that it adds to the charm of the place. The food is pretty good - I like the goat/lamb biryani the best. But I'm bias because I'm always partial to biryani over dishes like tikka masala, butter chicken etc. The adjoining grocery store is fun to stroll through and as an Indian person, I felt so comfortable because the aisles were filled with products that were familiar to me."
"5.0","Went to Freshii this morning and loved the environment (back quiet area to relax, coffee bar, clean).  Very friendly and helpful staff as well! Glad to see this addition on Grant street - gives healthier options close by."
"4.0","Unique japanese bar food that is always made very well and beautifully!! A little more pricey than an average sushi place but thats because of the great japanese bar like ambiance and the unique preparation of sushi and other japanese dishes that are hard to find anywhere else in Pittsburgh!"
"5.0","Great environment, awesome for large groups. We ordered multiple plates and ate family style. The food came out fast. The waitresses and staff are really nice!"
"4.0","I like Little Nippers because they're open late.  Their calzones are delicious and gynormous.  The guy at the counter is super friendly.  I think he even wrote me a poem once.  They also carry large bottles of Pepsi for like a dollar.Their pasta.... isn't so great though.  But man, those calzones."
"4.0","Love the cinnamon crunch bagel especially as a breakfast sandwich. The atmosphere is great with free wifi with lots of available seating. Service is speedy."
"1.0","Not real Italian. When there's a crab dish on the menu and you don't let your customers know this there's a problem. Imitation crab meat at an Italian restaurant doesn't fly. I was hoping for some good Italian while out of town and was truly disappointed. The bar service was extremely friendly about my compliant and did remove that dish from my bill. My entree was pasta and shrimp. I haven't paid $20 for a dish of pasta and 5 large shrimp in a long time. Don't worry but I won't come close to this restaurant again."
"5.0","I cant wait to come here again and again. Just stopped in for breakfast. It's so freaking CUTE. I got an egg sandwich and an ice coffee. Their bread is the best that I've had in a restaurant, a crusty roll that is so soft and flavorful in the inside. My iced coffee was delicious. Usually when I go out for breakfast they give me more food than I can handle, but the portions here are perfect. I'm excited to go back and see what they have for lunch."
"4.0","On an unsually cold May night which Penguins happened to play , during my very first visit to Pittsburgh while I was walking toward my hotel I walked by this place , it's hard to miss it because of big bright signs they have got outside .1st thing caught my attention was people smoking inside ! If you want to know more about smoking law in pittsburg you can check out : http://www.no-smoke.org/goingsmokefree.php?id=161It's an old but very cool local. I sat at the bar and ordered a beer from tap ,beer showed up and it was cold enough! That is why I am giving them 4 stars .I had a burger , it was great . My waitress was very friendly and good at her job .If you happen to stay in station square arwa you should check this place out ."
"5.0","All I can say is they have the best cheesesteak that I've every had. I only get them here."
"5.0","Our server George was the best by far. He was attentive but also let us enjoy our meals and wasn't too over bearing. He was so sweet and we really enjoyed our time here before going over to stage AE for a concert. We will definitely come back again and request to have him as a server!"
"1.0","my husband and I really love Indian food and before we moved here from Baltimore we'd order it via delivery pretty frequently. So we decided to give this place a shot. Calling the order in was painful, The person who was taking the order had us repeat numbers frequently and even after spelling Walnut twice, he still did not seem sure that he knew what we were telling him. We should have taken this as a sign.I ordered palak paneer - my favorite - what arrived was very different - something with peas and it was orange instead of green. When we called in to complain the person who answered the phone did not understand what the problem was and passed the phone to someone else who argued with us telling us we did not order palak paneer but what I found out later to be mata paneer. I've never even heard of this - we did not have a menu and just ordered our favorites.  Instead of trying to make the situation right, by replacing the food or offering to remove the wrong dish from our bill ,they offered the next entree free. We continued with dinner and immediately we knew this was the worst Indian carry out we'd ever had. the sauces were really thin and tasted weird. The cheese in my dish had a really off texture compared to the dozen or so places I've ordered this dish from. Since I had never tried mata paneer before maybe it is supposed to taste like a lot of sugar was added. I do, however, know that Tikka Masala is not supposed to taste sour. We had asked for both to be medium spicy but the chef must have put the spice in twice, it was so hot that it was barely edible. The garlic and regular nan, on the other hand, was excellent. The rice that came with it lacked all of the cardamon pods etc in it that I've always had with indian carry out.... it was just plain, really dry, unseasoned rice.After tossing out most of it both of us felt very ill and bloated after the meal, i really thought I was going to vomit. Between the service and the lack of quality of the meal, we will never order from this place again. They can keep their free entree."
"4.0","Great find for a late brunch! We arrived around 1pm on a Sunday, but there was plenty of room to sit. Folks weren't hanging around; which made it easy to grab a table. We ordered the Ricotta Blueberry Pancakes and two egg breakfast. First off, they must be serving dinosaur eggs, because it was huge! They had to have added cream or something too, because there was a distinct creamy flavor to them. Very hearty and delicious! It was served with a side of toast, herb dusted potatoes and thick smoky bacon...yummo! The pancakes were like a dream :) Fluffy, sweet and oh so scrumptious! It was like blueberry birthday cake for breakfast. My only complaint was the tight quarter's, but it's old city row house style...not their fault. Service was excellent though, so i will definitely be back!"
"4.0","Lovely little place for Portuguese food - not to be confused with Brazilian food. We had the lunch entrees - shrimp in tomato sauce and the vegan feijoada (different from Brazilian). Wonderful service and great tasting food. Varied menu with soups, traditional Azorean and American breakfasts (with an Azorean touch). Great coffee and hot chocolate! And did I mention great service!"
"1.0","Eaten here a couple times before and overall was nothing special.  From my previous experience I would rate Gennaro's a 3. However, my recent order I decided to try the buffalo chicken pizza and I would not recommend it. The pizza is loaded with fries, seems like it has no cheese and is doused with buffalo sauce.  I was only able to eat one slice of the pie before I was done with it."
"4.0","Don't come here if you're looking for a healthy breakfast.And definitely don't come here if you don't want to wait around, especially when the local schools are in session.But DO come here for amazing hotcakes and the most glorious, buttery, greasy spoon breakfast around.  The hotcakes, for those of you unfamiliar, are more like crepes.  Usually stuffed with fruit and whipped cream and fried in butter.  Extremely sweet and rich and the best ever cure for a college hangover.Prices are cheap and the place is cash only.  Super friendly, quick service.  Always on my must-visit list when I'm back in town."
"2.0","This was on my bucket list because I am a big Steelers Fan a friend gave us there tickets to the game then today my wife made sure we made it to the restaurant.I was so disappointed with the food and when there was a problem the person in charge thought it would be nice to let me spend time in the VIP Room and discount our bill, he missed the point.630 p.m food arrived around 730 it was all wrong so he gave us a reason why and cooked it again  745 our food came out wrong again . Now comes insulate to the bucket list the person in charge thought we came for a free meal and gave me a tour of a private room and told me Saturday was his last day and it was all he could offer me and my guess and have a nice day.So if I was going to give you some idea of what the restaurant food and service was like well our server was great the food from chicken too the steak ?"
"5.0","Talk about an all around great restaurant ! My boyfriend and I are visiting from MD and decided to have lunch here because why pass it up??? Our server was fantastic as we never saw the bottom of our glasses!! THe periogie appetizer was to die for and our meals were just as great. Highly recommend sitting outside on a nice day!"
"5.0","Consistently fantastic - love it! Reasonable prices, a really fantastic ambiance, and overall great food makes Umami the restaurant I take family and friends to when they visit Pittsburgh. Definitely make a reservation - it can really fill up - or, go right when it opens. Making a reservation and going on a weekend night, with the neon lighting up the windows and a dj behind the bar, is an experience in itself. I've had better drinks at other nearby places, but the food is definitely worth a trip. Go during happy hour to try some of the drinks, and to get some great small plates."
"5.0","SUCH a lovely spot. Very relaxed inside- seemed like a good place to pick up a quick drink, sit and study, or sit down for a proper meal. I ordered the Galao latte which was deliciously sweet and came with a cookie! I also tried the custard tart and wish I could've tried all the pastries. I've got my eye on the almond tart for next time. I also wanted decaf coffee and the employee very sweetly brewed an entire pot for only me. They had several vegan and vegetarian menu items so I can't wait to come back!"
"5.0","Pancakes were wonderful. They accommodated my daughter's allergies. It is hard to eat out for our family. I am grateful for them going the extra mile for making sure my daughter could eat something."
"2.0","Looking at all the other reviews about this place, I wondered if we actually went to the same place.  I thought it wasn't very good.  I had the Eggplant Alexander which consisted of a bunch of soggy fried eggplant with a ton of cheese melted on it.  I've made much better at home.  My beloved had veal Parmesan.   Which was dry, overcooked and lukewarm.  Did we catch them on a bad day?  I'll never know because I don't think we'll return."
"5.0","I was amazed at the quality and portion sizes here. they have a fantastic selection of hot foods and friendly employees. The kebabs and falafel are top shelf. to top it all off, the prices are the best for the food you get. You have a new regular customer."
"5.0","Loved  this place . All of the colors match Pittsburgh tradition of black and gold. The restrooms are black and gold as well.We stopped in and had a sample flight of beer. All of the beers were good. The staff was friendly."
"5.0","I eat with my eyes closed because the food makes me feel like I am in India. My daughter loves the mango shake but she can never finish it so it means some for me! So that is another plus."
"5.0","George was a blast! Our puppy Maggie loves him! Food was great! And the hostess was wonderful! First time there but so peaceful outside! No traffic right beside you as you eat. Will be back! Grilled wings were amazing!"
"5.0","When we order Indian, my boyfriend always, without fail, orders chicken tikka masala.  It looks so yummy, and I steal bites of his rice soaked in the sauce, and then I complain about how nobody offers vegetarian tikka masala.  Once I tried to make tofu tikka masala.  (It sucked.)  And then!  I heard about Tamarind.  And I looked at their menu online, like I always do.  And they had paneer tikka masala!  'We're going here,' I decided.But I didn't even tell you the best part yet.  I almost don't want to, for fear that the next time I go it will be overrun and crowded and I'll have to wait for a table or they'll sell out of something good.  But I'll tell you.On Sundays, they have a 2 for $25 deal.  An appetizer, two entrees, an order of naan, and two soft drinks.  For $25.  And their portions are huge and come with a side of mixed veggies or dal soup.  You really can't go wrong.  Their menu has both north and south Indian dishes so everyone can find something that sounds delicious.I thought the atmosphere was really nice and the service was really attentive and fast, unlike previous reviews.  I will definitely be back and I look forward to trying more of the menu."
"2.0","Came here with high expectations, and I rarely make a trip to Oakland these days. Initial impression, is that the upstairs seating hadn't been cleaned in a while and the place was a bit of a mess.As far as the food, I found the chicken to be overcooked and the fries to be undercooked. On the plus side, the flavor combo of the sandwich with the coleslaw was good as was the portion size. I was expecting a juicy piece.of chicken but even with the hot sauce it was a bit dry (only saved by the coleslaw). I literally couldn't touch the fries they were so soggy.The mild is plenty hot, and my wife could barely finish her hot tenders which is saying something.I'd definitely give this place another try, but wasn't the best first impression."
"2.0","Came for a late lunch after a duck tour across the street. The restaurant is located inside of a mall like building tucked in awkwardly behind offices. The decor is a simple Japanese style. The music took away from the food and decor. It was a strange hybrid between modern sounding guitar and traditional Japanese music, either way it became slightly annoying after the first few minutes. We ordered miso and and 6 rolls. The soup was alright. The rolls were presented nicely, but over sauced and tasted salty. The quality of the food did not warrant the cost. Single pieces of sushi were outrageously priced. No where near the quality of CA sushi, but it was okay for Pittsburgh. I was highly surprised by the rave reviews listed across social media sites.  Overall, would not recommend."
"4.0","Came here with a group of 7 and the restaurant was able to get us seated right away. The location is in Lawrenceville so there's plenty of street parking although sometimes you have to circle a bit to find a spot.  The restaurant itself has a good amount of seating in addition to a large bar. There is also a cinderlands warehouse which is the big brewery located in the strip district. This location has some of the beers on tap but does not have as extensive of a selection as their main brewery. In terms of food, it's typical American food with burgers/sandwiches in addition to main plate entrees. Everything the group ordered was good but nothing was amazing. They have a variety of beers to choose from  including IPAs and sours. I believe they change their beer selection every so often so there is always something new rotating through. Having been to both cinderlands locations I like the strip district one better. It is larger and more spacious and has a larger selection of beers available. Regardless if you're in the area stop by and check it out."
"2.0","The beer and soda list is pretty impressive; and, the fries are fantastic. Unfortunately, those are the only nice things I have to say. On a relatively slow day, two hours past the typical lunch rush, our service was awful. It took over an hour for just a couple of sliders and fries - not to mention how ridiculously expensive the sliders are. I'll make it easy for you: skip Burgh'ers and got to BRGR or Burgatory for a good, quick, reasonably priced burger."
"4.0","'Good things come in small packages', they say, and this little joint is a prime example. Quirky, cozy taqueria with good food and service!"
"5.0","This has been my family's favorite Chinese restaurant since I was a kid! Since as long as I can remember (late 1980, early 1990s?), the folks that own it and everyone who's managed it since then have been amazing! The atmosphere is chill, and it was the first place I went out to eat after I moved back to Pittsburgh. It's where I take (or get take-out for) friends from out of state when they visit. The food here is what I measure all other Chinese restaurants to, period. Praying for many continued years of delicious success!"
"5.0","My daughters and I have been going to this restaurant for many years. The owners are really nice and so are the servers. We eat at Indian restaurants all over the area and outside of Pgh too. We feel this is the best Indian food in Pittsburgh. One of my daughters is vegan. They are very accommodating. We highly recommend it. Parking can be challenging but it's worth it."
"1.0","Apparently you are not allowed to have 2 drinks at one time at this establishment, otherwise you get asked to leave. Joshua, the 'manager', was an absolute prick in handling the incident, claiming that as a 21 year old I could not exercise my 21st amendment rights to consume alcoholic beverages at my leisure on a Saturday night."
"2.0","This coffee shop was very disappointing. We went in because of it's cute aesthetic, but the cashier was not friendly and we waited 20 minutes for just a tea. Once we got the food it wasn't worth the wait. The peanut butter and jelly had almost nothing between the slices of bread and the iced mocha looked like pond water. I would not return here."
"5.0","My husband just said 'I feel like I'm in Europe.'   As soon as we walked in, we were greeted warmly and the smell of croissants hit us hard.  Came in for a few birthday treats and left with a box.  Well done, La Gourmandine."
"1.0","This place gets one star, that star is ONLY based on the fact that it is a rooftop bar downtown.   Other than that single fact, this place blows.  Drinks are insanely expensive and the food was ridiculously expensive as well.  The worst part about this place was we went on a rainy night and they had the roof covered. It was so hot and humid in there I was miserable! I mean really, is it too much to ask for a little AC or at the very less a fan? I'm paying $13 a drink over here, people!!! Go to the bar a couple doors down. It was a dive but they have drink specials every night of the week and cheap food. I can't recall the name but it is directly across from the Marriott courtyard, some sort of Irish pub/dive bar.  My husband and I shared a massive plate of cheese fries for 7$ and several 6$ martinis!"

"5.0","Right in the heart of the Saturday afternoon market on the Strip, Edgar's and the competing taco stand just around the corner contribute to one of the best smelling street corners ever, with sweet and earthy tendrils of corn tortillas wafting by and hints of the various meats cooking on their griddles.With some of our brunch targets packed to the gills on a beautiful Saturday afternoon, my girlfriend and I switched to snacking at the various food stands on the Strip, with Edgar's being the main stop. I went with a chicken and lamb barbacoa tacos and their watermelon agua fresca to drink. The lamb was lightly topped while the chicken was more generously topped, while you're left ot finish it off with the salsa of your choice, and I just went with what looked like salsa verde.Sitting down at one of the handful of tables next to their stand, we dug right in. The lamb was tender and flavourful, and the sauce it was in kept it from getting too dry. There was a little bit of spice to the guac and a nice fresh pop from the pico and all of that was evened out by the queso fresco. The chicken had a mild flavour, but it was tender and moist, and topped equally as well as the lamb.The watermelon agua fresca was fantastic. It tasted simply of watermelon with very little, if any, extra sweetening, just letting the fruit stand on its own.Edgar's was an excellent spot in a equally great little area. Hit this place up if you're in the Strip."
"5.0","First time I tried this place and was great. Quick, quality, and wholesome food in Oakland area. Try the chicken sharmola, will not be disappointed."
"4.0","We tried the Pierogis and sandwiches.  The food was pretty good.  I liked that they served sour cream with their pierogis.  I liked that the Pierogis were slightly crispy.  The only reason this was not a 5-star is because they kinda made a big deal about my extremely well behaved service dog.  They requested to her license which is actually illegal to ask for.  I hope that Jerome Bettis' Grille's management will post the service dog laws in their back room and educate their employees about the legalities.   Here's a link: https://www.ada.gov/service_animals_2010.htm"
"2.0","$9 for a chicken salad that consists of bagged salad, maybe two pieces of cucumber and chicken that has a gamey taste. You'd think I would learn after three times but not so much. I'm told the sandwiches are delicious. Not sure I'm willing to try. This is one of a few places located on the very bottom floor of the USX Tower there to serve lunch to the thousands working in the building. So I'm guessing it's easy to sell overpriced grocery store bagged lettuce to us."
"5.0","Just opened up yesterday. This restaurant had amazing chicken way much better than Chick-fil-a's chicken. I would definitely recommend this place to every Pitt student. If you're feeling down, enjoy some juicy chicken. They have different flavors and when you tell them how hot you want it,  they'll always tell you to go down one sauce. It's true because my friends tried the hottest option and their mouths were burning lol. Be careful with the hotness choice. Anyways try it out and enjoy!"
"5.0","It's been quite a while since I've had a breakfast that good, in fact it caused a complete emotional breakdown followed by crocodile tears of joy and hugging the entire wait staff! I had the eggs over BBQ Brisket Hash and it was so inventive and flavorful, I could t inhale it fast enough!  I've been sitting here for four hours not knowing what to do with my life meow....I guess it's time for lunch!"
"5.0","One of my new favorite places in Pittsburgh and definitely the best place to get Japanese food in the city! First of all, make sure to make a reservation because its gets very crowded and busy on the weekends. You can always walk in and see how long the wait is but it usually is at least 1-2 hours without a reservation on the weekends. Also, if you have a big group of people, there is an awesome room next to the entrance with low floor seating you can reserve. Would be great for any celebratory dinner! The place also usually have a DJ on the weekends which makes the atmosphere very lively. Definitely can get a little loud during the evenings due to the music and crowd, however I loved the lounge like feel. The bar offers an extensive drink menu including lots of sake and specialty cocktails. For food, there are many options and everything is reasonably priced! I would highly recommend the yaki udon noodles. This is my favorite dish and it was unlike any other noodle dish I have had! The udon noodles are cooked perfectly and topped with shiitake mushrooms, cabbage, tare, beets, onsen egg, and crispy chili which made the perfect combination of flavors. There aren't many vegetarian options when it comes to sushi, however they do have a wonderful tofu hand roll which was worth trying. Also loved the vegetable gyoza and king trumpet mushrooms. The miso ramen is also another great option with multiple options for add ons. All vegetarian items are marked on the menu and there are definitely enough options to have a filling meal. Great place for happy hour during the weekdays or for a place to take when friends are family are visiting! Definitely one of the more unique places to dine in Pittsburgh!"
"2.0","This is a charming neighborhood Italian restaurant but the food doesn't match the ambiance. I assume it's been in business for some time, judging from the photos on the wall, etc. Surprisingly the server was not well informed to guide us. She must have been new and seemed not to have tried the dishes on the menu. There is a full range of pasta dishes where you can match the type of pasta and choose from a number of sauces, but the sauces were bland. The garden salad was unremarkable. Pittsburgh has so many good restaurants that there is no reason to go out of your way for this one, which we chose because it was near our hotel."
"3.0","a decent spot for lunch given that it is pittsburgh.  it's maybe a little step up from your fast food chinese place in nyc, the quality is a little better and the restaurant itself is obviously cleaner.i started w/the egg flower soup, it was a little on the salty side, but at least seemed like it was all natural eggs and didn't have the weird fake dark yellow color to it that a lot of places have.  tea was on the house which is nice.  i had the eggplant in brown sauce w/white rice.  overall it was decent, eggplant tasted fresh, but this was also a little on the salty side as well.  i would have given it 2.5 stars if possible, but rounded up since the older waitresses are very nice and reminded me of my mom.  in the end a decent place for a quick cheap lunch (it's slim pickins for good restaurants in pittsburgh)."
"4.0","This was a special event that we were looking forward to for a few weeks. One week prior, i went online to change our reservation from 6 to 6:30. I received s confirmation email immediately. When we showed up right around  6:30 the hostess (talker one with long get hair) copped an attitude telling me that our reservation was for 6. I showed her the confirmation for 6:30, which she begrudgingly agreed but qualified that i 'must have changed it on the web...'.  That was a bad way to start out out celebration dinner.  I told the maitre he graciously apologized.  Maria was our very attentive server and the team supporting her was well coordinated.  Except for the rude greeter, everyone used appropriate 'Ritz Carlton' language and backed it up with very good service. Oh, the food, Well it was top shelf."
"4.0","I'm definitely a fan, even though they are new and still clearly ironing out some kinks. The most important thing is my wrap was delicious. I'm still thinking about it. I had the mexican kind of wrap -- can't remember the name -- with falafel. So good. The cilantro lime dressing was amazing, the tortilla was fresh, and it was all perfectly wrapped, which was awesome -- I hate when a wrap falls apart. We came at noon and it took a LONG time. Like 30 minutes to get the wrap. And then halfway through eating it my friend an I both realized we were missing the add on (her chicken, me falafel). I was annoyed because their food is not cheap as it is and it was 2 extra dollars to add the protein. I'm glad we decided to eat in since we noticed while we were still there. BUT, they are new and mistakes happen, the important thing is how they deal with it which they did very well. The manager offered us three choices -- give us the protein on the side, remake the wrap, or give us a refund. My friend chose her chicken on the side and I asked to have mine remade since I didn't want to upwrap the wrap. She had it fixed within one minute and gave us comp cards for a free meal. Awesome customer service. I can't wait to go back but next time I'll probably make a point to show up at 11:45 or 1pm rather than right at noon with the downtown lunch crowd."
"4.0","Came by with a local friend for brunch Saturday morning. Man was it crowded. We came by the door and stood in the line for more than 20 minutes. It was an very inefficient line system we experience as there is only one person ringing in orders... It was Saturday... everyone wants brunch... Outside of that, I am a fan. Our number was up stairs. Asked to sit at the balcony and we had the best view of the entire stripe. We shared and love the Western omelette and Fresh toast. I am not a big fan of french toast but this blew my mind. A Must ordered. Omelet had super fresh ingredient, also one of the best I ever had. Amazing! Would come back again."
"4.0","[Original Review - 2stars ]I ordered a 10 inches pepperoni pizza. Delivery was fast and pizza was still hot. The problem starts when i open the box and see a cheese pizza with four pieces of pepperoni (see picture). It was also super oilly and had a wierd taste. I wouldn't order pizza again from this place.[Update]The owner messaged me after this review and apologized for what happened and said they had a very busy night. I appreciated the guestur and the fact that they care about their customers so i changed the rating."
"1.0","oh dear... The only good dish we had was the appetizer, a deep-fried roll made of shrimp (or fish?) with pork and a sour-sweet sauce. Not bad at all.The remainder varied from ok to awful. Guess you want to know about the awful? The red curry with chicken. When chicken tastes like it has been washed in detergent, one of two things has to be true... It has been washed in detergent ... or it has not, but just tastes like! Either way, that's not good. The sauce was watery, not creamy at all, the veggies (peas and carrots) were very likely taken from a frozen pack (pre-cut). A sorry sight. and the unpleasant taste in my mouth lasted for some time after we left the restaurant.The pasta dish was better, but not terrific. Oh, one noteworthy feature about the place: it seems to be a magnet for Pittsburgh's hipsters. For some, this will be a plus, others may be less into hipsters sighting..."
"4.0","Ended up going to Cafe Raymond with my fiancé after we saw the lines for DeLuca's and Pamela's were both out the door.  It was a pleasant surprise! There was no wait and we walked right in, placed our order and grabbed a seat. We enjoyed some biscotti and coffee while we were waiting on our orders. I ordered the special of the day, which was the Southern Style Eggs Benedict, and she ordered an omelet. Our food arrived quickly and we both enjoyed it! The service was excellent as well. If you are down in the Strip, stop in and grab a good breakfast at Cafe Raymond, especially if you don't feel like waiting in a long line!"
"1.0","I was expecting really great food from the ratings but this was basically cafeteria food. The teriyaki chicken tasted like something I ate in high school 10 years ago. The tonkatsu was almost inedible as the meat inside was so chewy and stiff that the breaded outside kept falling off. The miso soup was bland and the sushi was really mediocre, especially for the price. They had a good crab/potato fried side that was pretty good that came with the meal but that's literally all. Not to mention the prices are outrageous and the meal doesn't even come with salad! I don't know if we went on a bad day but there was hardly anyone there and I'm not sure it was even worth half the price we paid. I guess I can't expect that high of quality Japanese food in Pittsburgh but this was disgraceful."
"1.0","My girlfriend and I stopped at Redbeards during Light Up Night.  At first glance, drink prices are high.  $5 Sam Adams was the special.  My girlfriend ordered a half rack of ribs and I ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken.  When I received my chicken and cut into it, I was able to pull the breading off the entire chicken.  I took my first bite and the chicken was rubber.  My dinner came with baked beans and cole slaw.  The baked beans were as if they had been sitting there cooking all day.  Beyond dry, and well past the point of being sold to anyone.  My girlfriends ribs were burnt, and the ones that weren't burnt had a fat cap that had not been properly cooked away so they were very chewy.  She had 2 ribs and a few french fries.  I ate two bites of cole slaw and a bite of my chicken and beans.  We notified the bartender that the food was not good at all and we would just like it taken off the bill, as we would just go somewhere else to eat.The bartender called the manager and told him the situation.  The bartender came back over and said that they took 50% off of the bill.  I had a beer, my girlfriend had a glass of wine, I had a bite of chicken, and she had 2 ribs - our remaining bill was $32.  I found another bartender and had them bring the manager over.  The manager told me that he took care of our bill by taking half of it off since we 'ate half of the food, and that the ribs were fall off the bone tender, and my chicken was properly cooked.'  I again told him the chicken was not properly cooked, it had a horrible consistency, and my girlfriends ribs were either burnt or encased in chewy fat, and I wasn't paying for any of the food but would pay for our drinks.'The manager took the food off our check, we paid for our drinks and left.  I won't be back with some of the other better options around Redbeards."
"5.0","Legit amazing. Don't listen to the doubters. If you don't like it you're a bitch and can't handle life or food"
"2.0","Food is eclectic, which is fine, but I wish for more of a normal menu.  Somewhere I can get some soft pretzels or wings etc. with my beer.  Also, it's pricey.  Atmosphere is odd.  Feels more like a diner or soda fountain bar.  The small 2 person booths are really uncomfortable. Beers were nothing that stands out."
"5.0","One of the best late night places. They have good music, amazing drinks and good food. I would recommend the squid and amy of their yakitorj sticks. I also tried their egg custard which was delicious. I would say the space is great although it may be a little crowded if you have large groups 10+. The service was a little slow, but that may be due to the time of night. I felt like I waited 20 minutes at a time when I needed someone's attention. But I would say the waiters were friendly. Excited to go back!"
"3.0","I used to love Pamela's because the chocolate chip hotcakes taste exactly like big, warm chocolate chip cookies, but the last time I ate here, I had such a bad experience that I lost all interest in ever coming back. I understand that diner-y restaurants use a lot of butter. In fact, I think that all restaurants use a lot of butter, but the last time I ordered the chocolate chip hotcakes, they were so buttery that there was a butter foam ring 2' wide around the rim of each hotcake, and pressing on the hotcake with my fork caused wet liquid butter to ooze out. The hotcakes just tasted like a stick of butter. Disgraced chef Paula Deen has taught us that butter is the best, but this was just ridiculous and completely turned me off of Pamela's."
"5.0","Be still, my carb-loving tastebuds! I'd heard about La Gourmandine for years, but never managed to visit them. Then they opened up a shop in downtown Pittsburgh, not far from where I worked. I was SO excited check them out, and they absolutely lived up to the citywide hype!This downtown location is pretty cozy, but they did a great job of utilizing the space they have. There are some tables and seats mostly lined along one of the walls, with most of the space allowing for foot traffic to look at all the goodies on display while walking up to the register. Staff members are quick and good at what they do, ensuring that the line moves at a pretty reasonable place for how popular La Gourmandine is.As for the goodies themselves, can you say divine? I'm in love with their almond croissant in particular - made with the lightest pastry dough, stuffed full of sweet flavorful goodness, and topped as high as possible with crunchy almonds. It's possibly the best baked good I've ever eaten, no joke.Whatever your carby preference may be - 'plain' bread, Danish, sweet cakes to cookies, savory concoctions - there's probably something here for you. Granted, this also means that dieters should probably steer clear of this place altogether. Fellow carb lovers, however, should go forth and enjoy this place as much as I do!"
"3.0","Overall score: 3.5/5- ambience: 4/5- food: 3.5/5- service: goodWe came to Umami on a Friday night, around 9:30pm, for late supper and drinks. The service was prompt and attentive, and the interior was tastefully decorated with an modern feel. There was a sushi bar as well as individual small tables scattered around the periphery of the restaurant. The food was a hit-or-miss, hence the 3.5 overall rating. We ordered:- Salmon Handroll: my favorite dish of the night. A single hand roll with a generous portion of salmon and salmon eggs. It came with a pipette of soy sauce.- Spicy Tuna Onigiri: my other favorite dish of the night. It was rather small, and also came with a pipette of soy sauce.- Karaage (fried chicken): I had high hopes but it didn't cut it. The texture of the fried chicken was good; however, the flavor was unidimensional and didn't have much flavor apart from being salty. It came with a tonkotsu gravy which was okay.- Tonkotsu Ramen with extra noodles (to share): my least favorite dish of the night. The noodles were bland, and the broth lacked richness and dimensionality.- Panda Panda Panda drink: I liked the drink. It was very fruity, and came in a interesting fish-shaped vessel. Not too strong.I'll probably come back to Umami and only stick to the sushi dishes the next time I'm there. It seems like a good late-night spot."
"4.0","I reviewed this place 5 stars previously but I have to drop a star. This was my go to spot for tacos, and I still enjoy it from time to time, but the quality and service has definitely diminished. I hope it's only temporary."
"4.0","I don't like that they only accept card but the tenders are good and the fries are too but too many small pieces. They have my favorite angry orchard and some nice jams playing in the background"
"5.0","This bakery was a very good surprise. I'm very happy to give this excellent bakery 5 stars. I went here to get dessert for friends and everyone celebrate stop talking about how good the dessert was so it was a great success for me. I got the apple pie which was simply amazing. Strongly recommend you get this. If you take it home, I recommend serving it with vanilla ice cream. In addition I got 2 almond croissants. The filling was generous and the croissant itself delicious. You could really taste the butter but in a good way. Definitely will come here again. Only wish they were open on weekends. Bottom line, If you get the chance do yourself a favor and stop here."
"4.0","When the Phipps made great strides on becoming more green and sustainable, they also made a commitment to making the Cafe more healthy and environmentally friendly.  The foods are locally sourced, the menu items are organic and thoughtfully prepared.   For example, it's hard to find healthy options for children, however the Phipps has gotten rid of their high sugar drinks in favor of healthier options.  The soups are quite wonderful, and so are the salads. The Cafe is careful about recycling, too, which I find to be a thoughtful touch. The sunshine streams into the glass walls, this cafe is a good place to change your mood to positive."

"3.0","The. Downtown location has a great bar and atmosphere.   The food was good a very filling grilled chicken sandwhich and some awesome sweet potato fries.  The bartender was very personable. Never lacked in service and offered to put a game on which was hard to see at the end if the bar.   He's a keeper!   I would have stayed and drank for quite a while if it wasn't for having to listen to a waitress stand at the end of the bar, cuss like a sailor, and complain about her job the entire time!  Made me feel like I was having dinner on the Jerry springer show set."
"5.0","Amazing atmosphere and food!  Don't miss the amber jack sashimi and the pork gyoza! Service was awesome and we've been telling all our friends about it ever since. Cannot wait to go back!"
"5.0","This is my favorite brunch place in Pittsburgh :) The place is so cozy, the food is always fresh, the staff are super friendly.Last time I got Nutella Banana Crepe, Vanilla Latte and Turkish coffee. The presentation on everything was so pretty! My crepe came up like bouquet of flowers, latte was topped with heart shaped foam and Turkish coffee was served in tiny cute cup! Everything was served hot and I really enjoyed my brunch! So this is definitely nice place to have breakfast and brunch!"
"4.0","Thai Gourmet is a solid Thai takeout place with very reasonable prices and big portions. It's at least a dollar cheaper for the Pineapple fried rice with chicken here than anywhere else I've ordered it, and the spice levels actually have a kick to them. Fried rice is my go-to fat girl order when I'm treating myself, but the veggies and grilled chicken they make look incredible as well. The spring rolls are also some of the best I've had, simply because the sauce with them has this tang and kick that's missing in the sauce from other standard Thai places. I may even try the noodle dishes here sometime instead of trekking to Shadyside for my beloved Noodlehead. Since Noodlehead is a completely different style of Thai place nothing could replace it in my mind, however I love how quick and convenient Thai Gourmet is. It's not much of a sit-down restaurant, but the service has been great whenever I've picked up and I'm sure I'd like it fine if I ever ate-in."
"2.0","Went here with a party of four.  They did not have enough seating due to reservations but could seat us at two two tops.  Upon leaving reserved tables STILL weren't taken (1.5 hours passed).  Someone should be supervising the seating a little better if they want to make more money and serve more customers. Dinners took forever and tables sat well after us were served before us (same meals).  Food mediocre.  Friends fries were ice cold.  Hubby had potatoes with his dinner and the portion was disgraceful (should've taken a photo - was the joke of the night). Drinks were served all to wrong people and each person was asked as they were served what they ordered - we fixed it after tasting each beer (bad mistakes for server for guests to straighten out the orders). Good thing we can taste the difference between an IPA and a sour beer!   Not worth the money to stop here for a mediocre meal and be served a beer that isn't correct - unless you want everyone in your party to sip it and tell which beer goes with which person.   Good thing we are all good friends but overall service and food just is unacceptable.  Also they cannot provide enough menus for food and beer to tables without waiting for other tables to finish using them.  Again good thing we were friends and could share menus upon finishing using them. For an establishment to not have an adequate amount of menus when they are not full and busy is strange.   Seems like a simple investment when you have paper beer menus and could invest in a few more food menus.  Just a thought if you're selling food and beer.  Hate to leave bad reviews but give credit where it's due.  This place could use some improvements for service and basic needs for customers."
"3.0","the atmosphere was awesome. they have a lot of drink options and a breakfast menu. the food was average but the atmosphere made up for it. for one person the sandwich could serve one."
"5.0","Come for the hotcakes! If you only eat one thing here, try the hot cakes. They are crispy like crepes but soft and fluffy like pancakes. The strawberry are my fave. My eggs were cooked just perfectly and the bacon was thick slices. The service was great. The coffee was. weak but eh its a diner, I came here for food at a great price. The service was great and fast. Just make sure to bring cash. This is a Pittsburgh bucket list or to do list stop!"
"5.0","Favorite Thai in the City of Bridges. What would I recommend? Everything. Just spin the menu and throw your finger down. Whatever fate has in store will make your day. But I guess if fate is taking a day off I would choose any of the salmon or eggplant or pumpkin varieties. They never pique me."
"2.0","If you wish you were at a bar on the south side, but happen to find yourself in Lawrenceville, Umami may be for you.  The food here is good, but everything else is not.  The evening I went, they had an extremely obnoxious DJ playing hip hop music at uncomfortable volumes that undoubtedly produce some hearing loss.  I asked the server if they could turn down the music.  They did not.  Another server later asked me to move over closer to the loud music to accommodate a larger party.  I don't think I will be going back."
"4.0","Had the best Toro ever at a Pittsburgh sushi joint the other night with the girl.  Whenever I go to a new sushi restaurant, wherever I am, I ask if they have Toro. A restaurant that has Toro in the first place, is a good sign. Then, a restaurant that has good Toro is obscure. A restaurant with amazing Toro, is a restaurant you frequent.  2 pieces of toro nigiri is be pure heaven if it iswhat they say it is.  I have been to several restaurants that gave me 'Toro' and it obviously wasn't... or it was a pitiful example of such. Toro is the belly/neck of the fish. It's the part of the fish that gets very little excercise (relatively) compared to the rest of the fish. So this meat is rich in buttery fat that you can see wet on the meat like little beads of oil. And unlike normal blue fin tuna which is reddish in color. The fat in toro gives it a lighter, closer to pink/white color.  Well needless to say Kiku was serving up some crazy good toro when we went... at like 8, on a Sunday night. The rest of the meal was great. I felt bad coming in at 8 on a Sunday but we sat in the bar, there were other people there chatting with the bartender, and the waitress made us feel very welcome.  This seemed to be a no frills sushi joint, which is just fine with me.  We are about the fish.  Their maki rolls seemed to be limited but we had a roll and the sashimi platter which was very impressive.  The platter had egg, octopus, mackerel, tuna, salmon, yellow tail, and one other I think. Pretty impressive selection for like 25 dollars.The cut of the sushi, the size of the cut, the temperature of the fish are all extremely important factors in perfect sushi and Kiku sushi did a mighty fine job in all regards. We will go back and see if we were just lucky or if this was a standard meal.  Kiku might have just gave Little Tokyo Mt Lebanon a little friendly competition.7.5 of 10 stars to be specific"
"3.0","I got a mint iced tea here as well as the lavande one. I think both were a bit too sweet for my taste, especially the lavande one. Not only was the lavande too sweet but it also had way too much lime in it which was clashing with the lavender flavor."
"3.0","Ok. Average Chinese at best. Was expecting better based on the yelp reviews. Chicken schzwan was mild and bland. Would not likely go back."

"4.0","We came in on a Friday and there was a good crowd. The hostess had stepped away so we waited a bit to be seated. All was taken care of and we sat down. The menu offers an interesting take on burgers, but we would have liked a bit more detail, e.g. what's the #theblend (meat and mushroom patty as our waitress answered when we inquired).I ordered the Fox Chapel, which has #theblend as well as goat cheese, with balsamic. Hubs ordered the Mexican War. Our burgers were flavorful. As someone who doesn't crave meat, the mushroom mix was appreciated. The Mexican War had chillies in the patty, which offered a nice kick. The food was a decent size and I'm a fan of places that offer side salads in lieu of fries as a no charge option. The buns are very basic potato buns. I'd recommend the restaurant being more adventurous with that. The draft list has a good bit of options. Hubs got the ESB--fine option for the price. I got the Millennial Marmalade. It was sweeter than I'd like, but should have gathered by its name."
"5.0","Living around the corner, I've been to The Summit about half a million times now and I didn't realize that my previous review didn't do it justice. I love this place. They have board games and no TVs. Which just promotes enjoying your company. Their food is so damn delicious. The portions are pretty accurate to how they segment them, small medium and big bites; Delicious on all levels. The menu changes as does the cocktail menu and it seems that everything they produce is delicious. I had the Green Curry Chicken skewer last time I went. The dish was so aesthetically pleasing and that pleasure was only compounded by how delicious it was. Charred enough to give it a grilled taste with a well-made curry that was accompanied by rice formed into neato slivers that you wouldn't recognize as rice and pickled pineapple on the side. There is a culinary genius at work here who is creative and knows about taste profiles because everything on the dish tasted great and complimented its compadres. Compliments to the Chef."
"5.0","So good! I've only been a couple times but so impressed Everytime. Yum! Bacon is so greasy but I'm not complaining lol"
"4.0","Don't go here for the ambiance. Go for the delicious, cheap and plentiful food options. I would recommend the chicken shawarma w/ the french fries!! I think they double fry their fries...they are amazing, and I am usually not a french fry person. I also got the chicken tikka masala meal which was just okay. They use huge chunks of white meat and the sauce is poured over the rice, so it was on the dry side. Very large portion for around $8. The grape leaves were meh, probably some of the least favorite I have tried. Their galub jamun was super overdone."
"5.0","The simplicity of a good taco shop is something that is often overlooked. Doce holds a reputable name within the college and South Side community with its small, yet pleasing variety of $3.00 tacos and Mexican sodas. I was impressed by the quality of the food, the friendliness of the wait staff, and the cozy bar vibe. I will definitely be back!"
"3.0","My boyfriend and I wanted to try somewhere new today, so we found Genoa Pizza on Uber Eats. We ordered a larger extra cheese pizza, some bacon cheese fries, and I ordered some fettuccine Alfredo. Delivery was pretty speedy, but the food was just okay. The pizza was very good, my boyfriend even agrees. But the cheese fries could have been cheesier, and my alfredo was lacking a lot of elements. The Alfredo sauce wasn't cheesy, could have used garlic and a few other spices. The piece of garlic bread it came with became soggy from sitting in aluminum foil. Overall I enjoyed it, but there's room for improvement."
"2.0","With my one experience through ubereats delivery, the sauce was really good but the rest (texture, cheese taste, and crust) was below average. Not the worst pizza i've ever had but i will not be ordering again."
"3.0","Why do they not have a proper Indian sit down restaurant in the South Side? We have more than a few Thai and Taco, even a Colombian, Spanish and Lebanese place, so I know the neighborhood can support food diversity, but not one dang Indian restaurant which I know would be a hit. In the meantime, while I wait, Prince of India is one of a few Indian restaurants that deliver to the South Side, where I live and work. I had a long day at work  scheduled so I ordered lunch from there for my coworker and me thru Grubhub. They have a two chicken dish combo with rice and plain naan I have been ordering to keep it simple. What's new, since I ordered last time, is they give you options to upgrade the plain naan( which I did to garlic naan) and I added two mango lassis to drink. They always deliver much faster than I expect which is a huge plus, and are always pleasant. The food is good with very authentic, satisfying flavors. Love the delicious (but small) mango lassi which is delivered in a styrofoam coffee cup for transport. The lassi is a little expensive for the price, but really helps cool down the spiciness of the meal. The garlic naan is served large and warm and is a great vehicle to scooping up the sauce of the dish. The chicken dishes are plenty on sauce , a little light on chicken , but the chicken that's there is very tender and good. Is it my favorite Indian restaurant? Heck no, but they get bonus points for delivering to the South Side. The last time I went to People's restaurant on Penn Ave, I asked when they would (pretty please) open a place in the South Side because we need them! They said they had thought about it , and if they found the right location ...maybe. So, until we get our own(hopefully tasty and BYOB) Indian place in the neighborhood, I will continue in the vein of Crosby, Stills & Nash, to 'love the one you're with' 'til the sweet day I can [eat at] the Indian restaurant I love."
"1.0","Low quality meat , I do not recommend this place  . I got sick after eating their meat"
"4.0","Love the lunch buffets. The Goat biryani is very good. Would definitely recommend this to a friend!"
"5.0","If one says you eat with your eyes first, you will eat a ton here. The place is great. The food looks warm, fresh, and tasty. Had the Parisian sandwich and was really well-fed for $6. I also took a lemon tarte to go and ate later after dinner. Also delicious. I am already planning my second visit."
"4.0","My 1st time here.. It was so GREAT.. My BFF had her brithday dinner here .. The food was soooooooo super GREAT.. Everyone was very nice.. O.. Don't 4get to try the happy hour 6-7pm good deals"
"5.0","The best Thai food I've had in Pittsburgh.  It's always the little hole in the wall places that have the best food!  The staff were great, serivce was very fast.  We got Pad Thai, Pineapple yellow curry fried rice, red curry and green curry, all of which were AMAZING.  I used to go to Thai Cuisine, but I like this place much better.  Can't wait to go back!  Also BYOB with no corking fee...can it get better?!"
"3.0","Very fast and friendly service. The food was brought out very fast. The food was alright, the egg rolls were better then the meal of general tso."
"5.0","Fabulous bakery. Everything is wonderful. Their French bread is amazing. Even their sandwiches are delish!"
"5.0","Good place. I like the bbq skewer stuff. The sushi is good too as well as the deserts."
"5.0","After leaving California and the glorious Mexican food it has to offer..I thought I had condemned myself to taco hell when I couldn't find decent tacos around town. Enter Edgar and these marvelous tacos. I was at the Strip with a friend on a recent cold, fall (but basically winter) day when there wasn't a lot of foot traffic on the street. We were starving and crabby. I walked past Edgar Tacos and stopped in my tracks. I saw the Mexican hot chocolate being stirred, my eyes got wide at the sight of salsa, and the smell had me salivating. I ordered two chicken tacos with everything and boy was it so worth it. I didn't even care how cold it was anymore. These were it for me and I ate them with incredible joy. The salsa was fresh and the chicken was cooked perfectly. I'm going back ASAP!"
"1.0","I have no idea where to start with this visit . The waitress  seemed very confused and didnt mention specials  til we decided to order but hey whatever. Me and a guest started by ordering the lobster fries ( which were decent  )  then we ordered our entrees i had to tell the waitress i wanted my steak medium as she never asked and walked away. My guest got a chicken salad and I ordered the land and sea with the add on lobster tail.   A guy brought out our food and we never saw the waitress for a good 20 minutes so i was unable to inform her my steak came out well done ( tough and no pink at all )  so once the waitress does come over i inform her and she says i will take care of it .    About 10 minutes after me and my guest notice a man walking in from outside with clothing from a dry cleaners?  And he looks around then slowly walks to my table and says whats the matter?    Stunned as to who he is, i said my steak was cooked in connectly. He says he is sorry to hear and it will be taken care of and to please try them again he is the owners father , so i figured okay things will be fixed no problem.   So the manager/ chef who brought our food out comes over and says what seems to be the issue i explained the steak situation and was confused why i would pay $45 for a steak he says oh you didn't eat it?  ( must not be any communication)  so he says he will remove it, returns and only $25 was credited? At this point ive been done eating for nearly 40 minutes so i just pay for my bill and want to leave. As im walking outside the older gentleman approaches me and says was everything taken care of ( is there any communication is this place ? )   i explained not to my liking and he seems shocked and i tell him i eat out at many place quite a bit and he assures me he is sorry and to come back in and it will be all fixed this time because a life long customer is worth $22,000 .   I walk back in ( big mistake)  so the manager/ cook guy says what seems to be the problem, i explian my situation with the steak again and he says sir i cooked your steak it was cooked to 140degress and it was pink .   I question how it was pink if you didn't cut into it nor did you see the steak after i was served it? He said that my 3 pieces of shrimp and potatoes were worth the $20 that was not refunded and theres nothing else he can offer except dessert which he did offer initially. I decided to leave.My question is who is this guy that approaches me at a restaurant he doesn't even work at and why did he try to help more then the staff?  I've read of atleast 1 of this exact experience with this guy...Weird!"
"5.0","Wonderful. This is a necessary stop for all people visiting Pittsburgh. It's trendy, has a lounge feel while also having a live DJ. The ramen is outstanding, and the scallop hand roll was a treat that was easier to eat than sushi. Miso soup was delicious and paired well with the saki. The shrimp and pork dumplings were a good sized portion and delicious. It's in a good area, near the main bars in Lawrenceville, but there are great cocktails here too."
"5.0","This is the only place around Oakland where I would go to have Indian food. Definitely try the lunch buffet here. This is one place where the food is not altered to suit American taste. But if you are an Indian person trying out the food here, don't expect to be seated near the glass windows."
"4.0","Pretty decent pizza option in downtown. Great for lunch or take out on a rainy Friday night after work if you live in the city. Friendly staff, quick service, quality ingredients and that awesome cheesy goodness that only a local pizza joint can provide."
"5.0","This place has the best pancakes I've ever had. They have the perfect balance of buttery savoriness, crunch, and sweet. I usually get the banana walnut with whip cream pancakes. Service is always great and the vibe is casual and comfortable for a breakfast place."
"5.0","One of my favorite places in Pittsburgh. Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. Excellent food and drink menu. I highly recommend the Al Pastor tacos. Give it a try!"
"1.0","Very rude employees. Walked in to get grill and without acknowledging me he turns off the lights for grill food fridge and walks away. I asked if closed and he yells yes. It was dirty anyways. Don't suggest"
"4.0","Great choice for authentic tacos , burritos etc . Had pollo and a lengua (beef tongue) taco and all of them were super tasty and freshly made right in front of me. The workers inside were very gracious and helpful so it made the experience even better. I'll be back to try some different stuff they offer like the marinated lamb quesadilla which sounded great. Great place at a very decent price for tacos ."
"5.0","One of the best indian restaurant in town. Tasty food at reasonable price. The only issue I found is that the restaurant gets crowded on weekends and the food takes a lot of time to be served."
"5.0","Love this place!  Every time I come it's always a great atmosphere.  I love the open-air concept.  The drinks are great, but slightly pricey.  The staff has always been friendly.  The music is always awesome on the weekends.  Loved the Christmas decorations too!  Overall, I have nothing but positive things to say!  This has become one of my 'go-to' places to hang out on the weekends!"
"3.0","It's not in the middle of anything but I liked the old school feel and they had a good pizza special. The pizza was really good I would probably stop there again if I'm in the area. It actually feels like your in NY with the decor"
"4.0","This place has been around as long as I can remember. When I was a child my mom would bring home Chinatown food for special occasions, and I remember how fabulous the eggrolls were--just went back today after 30 years, they are still as fabulous as I remember!  I also had the hot and sour soup, which was filled with fresh mushrooms and ither Asian veggies.  These were so filling that I could not eat my entree!  Took my Szechuan chicken home, loads of fresh cut veggies and tender chicken. Delish!"
"3.0","Very convenient for Greenfield.  Eat in, take out or delivery.  Good pizza and calZones.  Delivery of beer is plus."
"4.0","This place is amazing, they open until 2am in the morning which is great in a city where everything closes early. I live close and I call to order and they are always super fast preparing the pizza. The best I have tested so far is Nipper's special pizza."
"5.0","After a fun night on Carson Street, it's always great to get some food. A friend led us to this taco shop that was open till pretty late. Their tacos are $3 and are a pretty good size. I got carnitas and pollo. They were very tasty and burst with flavor. If you're a fan of street style tacos, this is the spot!"
"5.0","First time here and very pleased.Pamela's was a great little breakfast spot.My family and I were in town from Florida and everyone one of us walked away happy and satisfied. The food was delicious and the portions were out of this world. Yummy  5 Stars."
"5.0","A great place to ear, sip wine & unwind after spending a day at the Phipps Conservatory. Had their Quiche & Cuban Sandwich which came with Faroe salad. Both outstanding. They did also have vegan choices. Vegan chili was delicious."
"3.0","cinderlands has a great atmosphere, friendly staff, and decent appetizers!we stumbled upon Cinderlands when looking to grab apps somewhere while we waited for our table at a restaurant across the street. on a saturday night around 6pm, our group of 4 was immediately seated in a comfortable booth in the brightly lit back area.at the suggestion of the extremely friendly waitress, we ordered the pierogi and chicharrones.pierogi: a little aggressive on the mustard for our taste, a bit pricy for the amount, but presented nicely and finished when split between us all. definitely a dressed up version of the classic.chicharrones: tasty, especially with the cheese sauce, strong taste of beer grain, but went quickly and felt like too small a portion when sharedwe didn't order beers but would consider coming back another night to try them. overall, the atmosphere was wonderful - bright, cheery, and open - and the wait staff were great. however, while the food was decent and uniquely flavored, it was pricier than we would like to pay for them and had room for improvement. i'm not rushing to come back here, but I'd be willing to give them another shot someday."
"3.0","The downgrade is not for the food, which has not seen any change in quality as far as I know. Rather, it's for their rather arcane policy of not serving sit-in customers as early as half an hour before their posted closing time. We got there at exactly 9:30p, and though they officially close at 10p they weren't having us eat in. This wasn't the first time either; I've come here before on Friday nights at various times between 9:30 and 10 and was turned away each time. We were hoping that half an hour would have been enough, seeing as this is no dressy $$$ place, but we were sorely disappointed.A last point--it would have been understandable if the kitchen had already closed, but we knew that not to be the case, as they still do takeout orders way past then. Having dined in multiple times before, we knew that the food takes at most 10 minutes to come out, and that half an hour, give or take 10 minutes, would have been completely sufficient for us to finish our meal from sitting down to paying the check."
"5.0","Updating my review to 5 stars because I've now tried multiple items on their menu and am always so happy with the quality and the quantity for very reasonable prices. Take out is really quick service - they usually have our order ready within 15 minutes! My favorites on their menu are vegetable yellow curry and vegetable Pad Thai. Ordering vegetarian items at restaurants can sometimes be disappointing, but not here - the veggies come loaded with all my favorites. Thai Gourmet is definitely worth a visit! Or change up your take out game and give them a shot."
"4.0","The long waiting line here seems to be a usual occurrence here at Pamela's diner, but the wait itself isn't too long either as the line does move reasonably fast.I was glad to have tried their blueberry hot cakes after seeing and reading how hot cakes are signature dishes of this place. I usually don't like having sweet breakfast dish like pancakes or waffles as main breakfast dishes but was glad I decided to try the hot cakes here. To my surprise, the hot cakes were not as doughy or too sweet at all. The corner of the cake was even crispy that it makes the cake not too filling. If I had to choose another filling for the cakes, however, I'd pick strawberry fillings instead of blueberry because with strawberries I think you get fresh ones instead of blueberries like what I had this time which seemed a bit processed.My SO also ordered some breakfast egg dish with corned beef hash and a side of lyonnaise potatoes. I didn't try his breakfast dish but tried the side potatoes that we ordered...and they definitely were yummy! I couldn't pin point how they got their lyonnaise potatoes so tasty..but maybe with a bit of cream?, onions and some butter? ...I honestly have no idea...I took a bite of the lyonnaise potatoes...and ended up finishing the whole side dish :x..oops..it was that good :)If you are looking for a good breakfast place in Pittsburgh, check Pamela's diner out. They have 4-5 locations within Pittsburgh. also, make sure you bring cash, as they don't take credit cards! Happy brunching here! :)"
"2.0","Warning: This place doesn't have a full bar. There are beers, naturally, four cocktails, and Arsenal cider (yum!). The menu isn't large, and the options traditional with a twist. Three of us got the pastrami sandwich, but it didn't taste like pastrami - not what we were expecting at all. The fries are delicious, though. There was only one desert option, which was a pop tart with foie gras icing on top. Eew. Basically I only liked the cider and fries. I hope the new location (former Spaghetti Warehouse) will have a larger and more traditional menu."
"5.0","The most stunning dive of dives in the city- neon lights and Yuengling at 10AM sharp. And the sandwiches! They're glorious. I may have erred in going for the brisket over the corned beef, but I couldn't have been happier. Paper-thin, moist, and sweet with onions and creamy dressing. The ideal sandwich, truly."
"4.0","Had a get-together here. Loved the beer and the atmosphere. On the rooftop there is a clear roof that opens and closes above you, so if its rainy you can still chill out and drink. Very cool!"
"3.0","Absolutely gorgeous setting under the open sky and string lights.  Love the fact that the roof is retractable so the bar can be enjoyed even in inclement weather.  As expected, it gets very busy.  You have to wait in a line downstairs until people leave.  Then you take the elevator up and deal with more crowds.  Despite the number of people, the bartenders were very quick and pleasant.  Drinks were incredible but pricey.  We had to leave just because we didn't want to keep dropping $10 for each drink.Another negative is how hot it was.  There was absolutely no circulating air.  No relief whatsoever.  It appeared as though there were AC units behind the bar but we couldn't feel anything.  Even some industrial fans would have helped."
"3.0","The Summit presents a dilemma for East-Enders such as ourselves. The location is sub-optimal. On the occasions that we might venture to the mount we're probably looking for food and drink and since you'll only find the latter here, it probably won't be out destination. Perhaps a 2nd stop, but that's a dicey proposition if you've got to head back down afterwards. The occasion that brought us here was a friend returning to town and holding a happy hour to see everyone at once. On all such future occasions, this is a great place to hold them. The place is spacious, the drinks are well crafted, and the ambiance is warm and trendy. Also, USB and power plugs under the bar!?! Yep. Very cool addition that I wish more bars would have."
"4.0","Food was good. Service fantastic. I was not dissatisfied in any way nor was I thrown off my feet. All in all, a great night with family... and server  was good at reading us in that we didn't wanna rush. We wanted to have cocktails followed by apps, salads, dinner and then desert/after dinner drinks, with ample time between each course. Very enjoyable night with the best company one could ask for."
"5.0","Best tacos I've had in a long time! I literally come here once a week since finding out about this place. Affordable too!"
"5.0","I'm so glad Doce Taqueria is in Pittsburgh! This place has all the elements of a perfect little taco shop. There are Mexican bottled sodas, the tacos are absolutely delicious, they offer black beans and nachos to supplement the few taco varieties, and the price is right! You just can't go wrong with that. My boyfriend and I stopped in on a Friday around 6:30, and it wasn't too busy. We were able to sit and put in orders immediately. It was fun watching the staff assemble our food, and the ingredients all looked and smelled incredible. One note about the service...I thought everyone was incredibly friendly and responsive, however I can see the staff potentially forgetting or not seeing you right away on a particularly busy night. Nothing to keep me from coming back, however I think I would prefer to come when it's less busy since I need my tacos customized due to my dairy allergy.Between us we tried the carnitas, chicken, and beef tacos. I inhaled my carnitas and chicken tacos...they were the best I've had in Pittsburgh by far. In addition to beef and carnitas tacos Kyle got an order of nachos. I could only look longingly at them since I can't have cheese. He said they were wonderful. I had a Mexican Squirt with my meal and he had an interesting variety of Mountain Dew. We'll both be getting Squirt next time! It was surprisingly refreshing. I'm planning on coming back to Doce Taqueria sooner rather than later. I want another carnitas taco already!"
"5.0","We came here based on a recommendation and the fact we needed to go to the Apple Store a few doors down.  We put our names in and had to wait about 30-35 min.  Large group waiting meant this was good to go! Staff was very friendly and fast.  We ordered and the food was there within 10 min.  Very impressed.  I ordered a stuffed hot cake with blueberries and it came out looking like a crepe which I loved.  The resin was that the hot cakes were stuffed with blueberries.  Definitely got your money's worth here.  Portions were not to bad or I learned my lesson from the day before.  Price was also very good too! They also have a location in the Strip District.  I recommend!"
"5.0","Yum!  Just yum!   Delicious, creative, and trendy breakfast options.   The only problem is I couldn't just pick one!   I'll be back to try more!"
"3.0","We made reservations for Thursday evening at 7 PM and found it fairly crowded, but with spots still available. The venue is intimate and decor is nice, perhaps our favorite part of the experience.We waited a bit for service, a bit of a miss. It was a wait before our server came. I ordered tuna onigiri and robatayaki (squid as the red snapper that is so photographed in these reviews was unavailable) and hubs ordered chirashi. The onigiri comes out. We're perplexed as how to approach it. We're looking around and I see others picking at it, using a soy sauce bowl to dip. Unfortunately, there's no soy sauce bowl or server around. Blah. I attack it nonetheless. It works. Taste wise, it is very average. The scallions were very mild and it was more rice than anything. A soy sauce bowl would have done wonders. I ended up spreading the wasabi using chopsticks. The squid comes as I'm working on the onigiri. Hubs has a few bites as he waits for his dish. I've finished and start on the squid for a bit before the chirashi arrives.The squid is colder than I'd like, considering it was off the flames. Hubs thought it was his favorite item. His chirashi was very average. It was an elaborate presentation like the onigiri, but nothing that left us wowed.Service wasn't attentive for us. Another couple sat next to our table as we were wrapping up and they were offered greater service and attention, offered tap versus sparkling as we were given regular tap, without so much as an offer for something else.No rush to go back."
"4.0","Desperation ordered on Grubhub when I got home super late from work - was an excellent choice! In expensive, tasty, fresh - quick service (I picked up my order). Will order again!"
"5.0","One of my most favorite places in philly over a sandwich!!! I love the New Yorker, it's def a favorite! Take that thing home and put some A1 sauce on it, forget about it.... Lol. Really great place though"
"5.0","Ah, Pamela's. A true Pittsburgh favorite and must-go place when out-of-town friends are visiting. The food (best known for the famous hotcakes) is delicious and I always get the banana and chocolate hotcakes. It is truly a testament to the Pamela's deliciousness that when Michelle Obama visited Pittsburgh and ate at Pamela's, she asked the White House chef to get the hotcakes recipe to make for her at home. The hotcakes are truly decadent and probably have more butter and saturated fat than everything you've eaten today combined. But it's a wonderful calorie splurge every once in a while! Know that the wait is typically long (especially for Saturday and Sunday mornings) and it is cash-only, if memory serves."
"4.0","Very solid place--food comes out fast and you get a lot. Lunch comes with hot tea. Lots of vegan options. I had the curry vegetables with a veggie egg roll. It was kinda like Japanese curry--more liquidy and has some nice spice. They had a very good chili sauce if you want it hotter. Veggies are broccoli, carrots, potato, onion, water chestnuts, snow peas, and baby carrots.  Was a bit too salty. The curry came already poured over the rice--I'm sure you can ask to get them served separately. Lunch special comes out to $10 even, which is nice. Egg roll is HUGE! Has cabbage, onion, and maybe carrot inside. Very solid. I would def return."
"5.0","I have never been to any other restaurants as many times as I went to Salem! The food is always fresh and delicious. The people are very nice and cordial. If you like Asian (Bangladeshi, Indian, Pakistani) food, you should definitely give it a try!"
"4.0","Sausalido is truly a hidden gem in Bloomfield! Inventive, creative dishes, stellar service and BYOB. One can't ask much more. Reservations are recommended because it's not huge. I really like the upstairs space best because there's a bit more elbow room than downstairs, especially if you have a larger group. You're greeted with a chalkboard of the evening's specials - typically a fish of the day and other seasonal specialties. It's easy to order off that menu. Love the bread and bean dip they bring to the table and the smoked Gouda appetizer is not to be missed. We've ordered it every time. You can choose a dinner salad portion of any of their options or their soup to begin your meal. I'm hooked on their Beets & Bleu Salad and it's perfectly sized as a starter. Even though the menu changes regularly, the crab cakes are always there and they're delightful with a different flavor profile than a typical crab cake. My friend can't keep herself away from their pork chop which comes with a stellar presentation, as does their lamb. The fish special preparation changes regularly, too. We've also really enjoyed steak and pasta dishes. On our last visit we actually saved room for dessert and shared their chocolate, caramel, cashew bread pudding. Wow, it was amazing!Service during every visit has been perfect and our wine glasses never seem to be empty. Great restaurant!"
"4.0","I think this place has the best food and atmosphere of anywhere to eat within easy walking distance of CMU campus.  I have lunch here at least once or twice a week and am hardly ever disappointed.My favorite thing to order (and, in my opinion, the best bang for your buck) is their quiche of the day.  With that order, you get a generous slice of quiche, your choice of a soup or salad side, and -- at least if you pick a soup side -- it all comes with a refreshing vinegar-based coleslaw (no mayo).  Their quiches are always excellent!  Perfect crust, excellent filling texture, and well chosen mix-ins.  They are also almost always vegetarian.All of their soups that I have tried have been great!  I especially like the butternut squash soup and tomato fennel, but you really can't go wrong with whatever one strikes your fancy.  I've tried many of their daily soup specials and enjoyed them all.  Soups come with a yummy flatbread triangle for dipping.Nice salads too.  My favorite is the detox salad!  It's absolutely loaded with super nutritious things, but the ingredients come together well in a way that makes the salad much tastier than it sounds from the list of what's in it!  But...beware, if you order the detox salad as a side to the quiche (and I assume to other mix-and-match options, too), they charge extra.  They didn't tell me this once until after I was rung up and my credit card already swiped, so I was kind of annoyed to have paid $2 extra without being warned.The environment is very pretty -- go figure, it's in the botanical gardens building.  There is outdoor seating that has a gorgeous view when it's warm enough to sit outside, but the inside feels fresh and clean as well.  It's a nice place to take guests out for lunch if you are limited to the Oakland area.There is a big chalkboard menu that you can check out when you enter, then you order your food at the checkout counter, they give you a number, and you seat yourself.  When your food is ready, they bring it to you.  There is no room for tipping; I guess service is complimentary.  You bus your own food at the end, and they have lots of different bins to maximize environmental friendliness of the waste process.Sometimes this place can get extremely crowded from 12-1:30 with lunchers.  I have been on occasions where there were no seats available at all!  Also, it is baby-friendly, so sometimes the space can get cluttered with strollers and toddlers crying, etc.All in all, I think this place has solid food and am glad to have a place like it in Oakland!"
"4.0","Beta Bites is an awesome place because 1) it was literally 100 ft away from my apartment, and 2) they have really tasty, affordable food. They service is great and they have a diverse menu. My favorite thing to order is the chicken sharmola with their bomb fries. The chicken is always juicy and tender, and the bread is always fresh. I've ordered this multiple times and its always been consistent! My roommates and I love their fries, and sometimes order their fries to split when we need a quick carb-fix. I've heard their fried okra is good, but I have yet to try them. I've only ordered for pickup, so I can't comment on their delivery service, but they have a cheap delivery fee compared to other places in the Oakland area. Definitely check this place out if you want cheap and delicious food!"
"2.0","Antoon's pizza is okay, but it's really nothing special. At Pitt, there's a rivalry going between Antoon's and Sorrento's-- you're either on one team or the other, and it's the subject of many a heated debate in the dorms. Sorrento's pizza is much more flavorful and less than a block away from Antoon's, but I would recommend checking out both and deciding for yourself lol"
"5.0","The only place I go for Thai in Pittsburgh.I mean, it's amazing. We do take out from here a few times a month, and it's always incredibly good at a great price. We usually mix it up with what we get, but my absolute go to's are the Pad Kee Mow and the General Tso's Tofu (DON'T JUDGE ME!! I KNOW IT'S NOT ACTUAL THAI FOOD!!). As a vegetarian, I've encountered less than inspired tofu dishes, but honestly, their Gen. Tso Tofu is amazeballs. No joke, I've ordered this for very, very non-vegetarian family members, and they scarfed it down thinking it was chicken. The food is always freshly made and high quality. It never tastes greasy or old.The curries all great and each definitely have a unique flavor. I'm pretty sure I've tried them all (except for the duck for vegetarian reasons), and I really love all of them, but the pumpkin is my slight favorite.It's family owned and operated, so you really need to go there and support them! It's BYOB, delish and try the Yum Tofu salad!"
"3.0","Standard Panera, from what I've experienced. In general, I feel that Panera doesn't give much food for what they charge.On Thursdays from 4:00 to 8:00, students can get any soup in a bread bowl for $3 with the purchase of a drink. Pretty good deal. The bread bowl also comes with chips, apple, or bread. I'm not sure if it was because of the deal (I've only been on weekends before), but there was quite a line when I went around 7 pm. The wait time to order and for the food to be ready wasn't bad, though.I'll probably be back only for this deal--there are plenty of other places that will give more food for less money."
"3.0","Ordered via Grubhub and had a positive experience with customer service. They delivered super fast, and were friendly, but the food was so-so. We ordered Saag paneer and Veggie korma (vegetable combo special, which includes naan and rice for only 22 bucks, not too bad!) and while the portion sizes were generous, the curries were very soup-y. The saag had no spices whatsoever, and somehow tasted reminiscent of chicken? While the veggie korma had somewhat better flavor, veggies were scarce and it was mostly sauce. We also had samosas  I think we would order again for convenience on a busy weeknight, but hoping that the chefs step up their game a bit."
"3.0","I used to really, really, REALLY like Pamela's. The crepe-like pancakes are my favorites in Pittsburgh and nothing will ever change that. I like 'em plain, with none of that sugary nonsense rolled in the middle. The croissant french toast is also another amazing dish, but sort of lame because it comes with no sides. The majority of the rest of the food is horribly underseasoned. That corned beef hash was an absolute joke. It's legit just the regular potatoes with corned beef sprinkled in, not cooked to meld all the flavors or anything. As of late, coming to Pamela's is a hassle. The crowded seating, the rushed and inattentive service, and the cash only system all really bother me. If you're gonna visit, go for breakfast and don't get your hopes up about much else."
"5.0","Edgar's is the real deal - possibly the most authentic Mexican style tacos you can find in Pittsburgh. Edgar is very friendly -- try your Spanish on him if you speak even a little. :-) This is an order outside and eat standing up on the sidewalk, take with you, or stand at the window bar inside to eat type of place. Very casual, and delicious. The options are little meat heavy, so may be difficult for vegetarians. Note that Edgar also has quesadillas, burritos, and other Mexican foods."
"5.0","My new favorite place . Wanted something different. Everything on the menu I wanted. It all looked so good. Got the Meditate Crepe. Every bite was heavenly. Also got a crepe with Nutella and banana and strawberry on top and nutella hot chocolate to drink. Everything was perfect and so delicious. Service was fast and friendly. Very clean place. Its Its beautifully decorated inside it gives you a feeling of being in Paris. Can't wait to go back."
"4.0","Loved CHiKN! Went with a friend on a Friday night around 9 and they were still busy. It's a fast casual restaurant so you order at the counter and they bring you your food. They also have a full bar and can make you drinks when you order. This must be new, because when I ordered a vodka soda the waitress looked at me like I had 4 eyes. All good though, it's a new restaurant I expect the quirks. The food was good, I had a medium chicken sandwich and the chicken was perfect! The fries on the side however were a bit bland. Ambiance was fun and music was bumping, I'll be back!"
"4.0","Wow wonderful food and service! We had the Ricotta stiffed pancakes and French Toast and it was mind blowing. You can tell it's all made with fresh ingredients even down to the fresh cream on the French toast!I was sceptical at first as I usually like traditional restaurants where they seat you and you get your bill later.. Not a fan of newer style restaurants and the system they have. But it makes sense. We were asked at least twice by different staff how everything was and that was nice! They seem to take pride in the dishes they serve which is nice. Colin was exceptionally nice and was very accommodating when we asked for more syrup. Overall was a great experience. My only comment is how do you know how much to tip when you pay first? Not familiar with how this process works as I'm used to tipping based on the service from the waitstaff but I guess those days are gone. And how do you know WHO your tip is going to? So many people came to the table."
"2.0","This place is awesome you can drink in the morning if you wish. The food specials are great. But the smoking makes this a place not to go. Honestly you come out of there smelling like an ash try. I would go here a lot more often if it was non smoking but it's not and the smoking makes me sick. But they have reasonable priced drinks and great food specials, the staff is really nice and it's a fun atmosphere."
"5.0","Some of the best food I've ever eaten in Pittsburgh. The staff is always friendly and inviting. The atmosphere is that of an old Victorian house. The whole experience is positively inviting. A must if you're traveling around Oakland or the Shenley area. Can not say enough good things about this restaurant!"
"5.0","I have to give 5 stars on this one. I've been eating Edgar's tacos since they first started and it's crazy how consistent they are.I don't know what classifies 'authentic' Mexican tacos, but they literally only sell tacos (and a burrito I think) and English is not the first language of anyone here, which for me are always the required components of 'authentic' anything.This place is the Standard for tacos in Pittsburgh.Get'em all... but I'm partial to the lamb and beef tongue."
"2.0","I Usually love Panera but this location just doesn't listen. Went there this morning and my eggwhite, avocado, and Swiss on sesame bagel came out as eggwhite, tomato, spinach on sesame toast. I repeated it to her 3 times..."
"2.0","Great concept and great space, but poor execution ruins it for me.  I've been here at several times at different times throughout the year.  I've never not been annoyed by something or another.   The good:  The space is pretty and I love the open roof/city views.  That's pretty much it.   The rest of it:   Well, for starters, the service sucks.  All the time.  No one is friendly.  The hostess/seating process still baffles me even after a half dozen visits.  It's first come first served, except that all of the tables are always reserved.  If you try to sit anywhere except the bar, you are immediately rousted and told (generally not so politely) to move.  It's crazy crowded, especially when the weather is nice. Their occupancy limit is definitely at 'pack it in' level.  There is usually a line to get up the elevator.  The bar is frequently three deep and always understaffed.   The drinks and the menu items are all overpriced - you are paying for the concept for sure.  And to boot, it's rarely a comfortable space.  The open air thing is great on the right day; but when that roof is closed, the temperature is way off.  And I notice that the sun is in my eyes a lot there.   Overall, I just don't love it."
"5.0","This was our first time at Umami: first impression: Loved it! We went there on a Friday evening at 6pm. We made reservations, as recommended. The outside of the restaurant wasn't clearly marked, which was slightly strange to me, but upon entering, the vibe was immediately cool. I immediately noticed the smell of sushi, not fishy, but fresh and lemony. You climb 2 flights of stairs and enter a really chill atmosphere. We sat at a table, but the best part was the bar area where you could watch the kitchen. Well sit there next time. We got drinks, very reasonably priced for Happy Hour. Some food items we got, the mushroom custard: this was my favorite thing! The flavor and texture was AMAZING! Get it! Also, the Scottish Salmon skewer: delicious and tender, the Wagyu tenderloin skewer: my boyfriend says this was his favorite taste. He got the sushi bowl, which was well worth the $18, boasting a wonderful assortment of fish, rice, sauces, and ginger. I got the pancake, which was super flavorful and huge. We can't wait to go back! Definitely would recommend trying some of the more unique items on the menu, the skewers, and that custard. I've never had anything like it."
"5.0","best damn tacos in the burgh!!! if you are alive and breathing you need to eat here!!"
"4.0","Best pizza take out / delivery in the east end; not the quickest, but the highest quality. Great pizza and fries. Falafel was decent too."
"5.0","best food i've had in pittsburgh for a long time. I've been here 3 times and was quite happy each time. I recommend making a reservation ahead of time online since it takes a long time if you wait. The actual place looks super nice and trendy too, but it was SO hot there went I went today. wagyu tenderloin skewer: was good but the least favorite dish of today, was a bit just too heavy? my friend's skewer was more raw and my other friends was more tough. mine was ok but it didn't make me want to eat it bacon wrapped quail eggs skewer: love this shit it's exactly what it's called but with an amazing glaze. the bacon is crispy and sweet and the quail egg yolk is so smooth and meltykaraage: the sauce is so good, a bit spicy but also very creamy, it's an interesting take on the typical mayo sauce i'm used to with karaage. and the chicken is nice and juicy with a softly crispy shell! squeezing the lemon is a must also. pork gyoza: don't expect your typical gyoza, this has a much thicker skin but the skin was so damn crispy it was fantastic!! again this other sauce paired very well with the gyozazaru soba: a pleasant and light cold soba. the dipping sauce was a bit sweeter than we liked so we mixed some soy sauce and water to make it a bit more savory. the nitamago (soft boiled eggs) were really good and the salmon skewer was super melt in your mouth. whole branzino: was very soft and melty fish nicely grilleddeviled eggs: the nori was very crunchy and the egg was smooth. octopus sashimi: i don't like other sashimi so i only ate this off the sashimi plate, but the lemon peel on it was very refreshing and it wasn't tough at all. overall very happy with the experience and we basically cleaned the plate on everything!!"
"1.0","Worst service ever. Had a reservation, waited 35 minutes at our table and no one came, even though the hostess told us two times that someone would be right over. Went to the bar to order a drink while waiting and they took 5 minutes to acknowledge me and there were only 4 people sitting at bar. Place seems very dirty. Sticky tables and barstools, Windows dirty. Doesn't look like they clean much. I would've left and gone somewhere else but since I paid $25 for two glasses of wine I figured I'd better wait.  I'll update with my opinion on the food if it ever comes...."
"5.0","It's just a name change. The food is as it's always been and I will sum it up in one word. Okay, two words:Perfectly delicious.Seriously you don't want to miss out on the joys of the offerings here. And you can't beat the prices either.Service is fast and friendly.Love love love love this joint!"
"4.0","My previous experience with Pamela's left me slightly skeptical about the fan base in Pittsburgh. However, when I went there the second time, my opinion was immediately changed. I'm not sure if the reason was because I went to a different location but I'm definitely a fan. My breakfast of choice was the strawberry hotcakes and I hit the jackpot. My love for strawberries coupled with slightly sweetened hotcakes hit the spot on the rigidly cold day I went. My friends ordered the chorizo breakfast special and also loved it! If you have a hankering for awesome breakfast food, Pamela's on Walnut is definitely the place to go!"
"5.0","My husband and I had a chance to try the dinner buffet (only $13 and $11 with student ID) and we really enjoyed every item that was on offer. The buffet comes with naan of your choice, deserts, and tea as well. Overall the spice level is very mild, so if you're specifically looking for spicy Indian food you might want to order off the menu and specify that to the server. However, everything was flavorful and cooked very authentically. Would definitely come back again."
"5.0","La Gourmandine is an great French bakery that serves great pastries and offers sandwiches, soups, a pizza flatbread, and two quiches. There are a few tables inside so you can dine in and there is limited outdoor seating in the summer. The bread is all obviously made in house and incredibly fresh. I prefer the prosciutto and pickle sandwich but the quiches are a great hot lunch item. Soups vary daily and are served with bread.All the pastries are can't miss. The tart aux framboise is pictured and is soft and sugary on the inside. The chocolate almond croissant is my personal favorite. All the pastries are sugary, flakey, and light. La Gourmandine also offers a loyalty program for frequent customers like myself"
"5.0","Super good! Great breakfast food, especially for the price. Super cute diner, love it, and highly recommend it if you're looking for a solid breakfast spot. FYI, the place is cash only!"
"4.0","My first visit today. We ordered a number of gluten free pizzas. They tasted great and the price was right.  We ever the only ones there. Service was average. I hope this place survives because the food is great."
"5.0","Saturday morning we got a late start but came up this way on a recommendation. This spot is located in a very fun area in the strip district where there's old warehouses, fun shops and open air markets. So as a fan of all three- I was in heaven. We came up this way and at first struggled with parking and a decent traffic flow, but managed to snag a spot and do some walking. Upon walking in we were greeted and explained how things work- order up front and scoop a table. Decor is very barn style and colorful with different chairs, looks of wood etc. They serve breakfast all day, which is a huge plus for me personally. I could eat breakfast all year. However, from looking at the menu they all have salads and sandwiches and plenty to choose from. Not to mention homemade scones, cookies, and pastries up front as well. Man man man.We ordered some breakfast and coffee and tea respectively- and took our seat and hung out. Planning your day over coffee while waiting for breakfast is low key my favorite activity on a Saturday so this hit the spot. Food was INCREDIBLE. I went with the omelette with bacon cheese and spinach. It was quite possibly the largest, thiccest, fluffiest omelette I have had. Also- was served with home fries which I didn't see on menu. Another added plus. Home fries had a nice flavor and kick to them, and condiments are available on the table. Coffee was good as well- though I would've liked to have more options on dressing it besides just room temp half and half. Great spot. I love it."
"4.0","Salem's always satisfies my craving of hot flavorful fresh Indian food. They have a parking lot, which is great since I am not a fan of parallel parking. Once you go in, just get in line to order. I was a bit overwhelmed the first time I went since they have so many options in the case and the menu hanging. They are also usually pretty busy. You can eat in or take out. I ordered their chicken biriyani which they had in the case and then ordered lamb biriyani which they said would take about 15 min to make. It was totally worth it because that biriyani had so much more flavor than the one in the case. Since it was takeout I just asked for sides of the chili chicken, butter chicken, tandoori chicken, and lamb curry, because they usually just put it over rice. Also I recommend getting their naan, it's huge and fresh. All their dishes are pretty good and are great for take out. Prices are also very reasonable for the huge portions, you will definitely have left overs!"
"5.0","This is one of the Japanese restaurant that I liked in Pittsburgh area. Their Ramen was good and the kebabs are good as well. I also really like how the restaurant was decorated with the Japanese decorations. It is just a little hard to find."
"5.0","This is a Millvale treasure.  Delicious food, great value.  I bought the $5 box with a double cheeseburger, spicy chicken sandwich, fries, Coke, and a cookie.  It came hot and the fries were placed in the box, without a bag!  Great touch!"
"5.0","We stopped here for dinner after a full day in the Strip and were told it'd be 45 minutes for a table for two. Fortunately it only was about 5 minutes!! Our server was very friendly and attentive. We ordered the catfish bites and lobster bisque. The catfish bites were disappointly not crispy on the outside, though they were still good. They would have been better crispy instead of rather floppy and soggy. The lobster bisque was yummy, but for a giant bowl we only got one little 'crustini' I believe it was called. Two or three would have been better for the size of the bowl. My husband and I shared the two dishes, and it was plenty for us. The portions were great, and the prices weren't bad at all. I recommend it for sure.An added perk was Robert Wholey (the owner's father) stopped by our table and talked to us for a minute. Later he offered us some oyster.  It was a great addition to our evening to get to say hello to him and meet the face behind Wholey's in the Strip!!! He was very kind!We'll be going again!!"
"5.0","Pamela's is a great classic Pittsburgh diner. This is the third location I've visited in the city and it's relatively small but just as good as the others. Affordable on a student budget, fast service, and always delicious. Only downsides are the long wait on any weekend morning, and cash only payment. Worth it! Plus there's an ATM right outside. Highly recommend the pancakes!"
"5.0","It was a bit busier so we had to wait a little longer for our appetizer and initial drinks, but then each course came at a good pace.   Our server, Greg, was super friendly and very sweet and helpful with wine pairings!     The steaks were juicy and literally do melt in your mouth.  The Gorgonzola Porcini Rubbed Sirloin was very flavorful and has a great Cabernet Reduction with it - delicious!!   The Cheesecake is Creme Brule style but delicious!  A good portion for 2 people, rich but delicious!!   Wines are perfectly matched with the food, could be a slightly bigger portion but they were excellent."
"5.0","Super cool place. Very artsy and clean. I would highly recommend Mr Green. Coffee is delicious too and I'm a coffee snob!"
"4.0","Definitely a great atmosphere, authentic Japanese spot.  In fact, my first time there we sat next to a Japanese business tourist AND on the other side was a Japanese and American business entrepeneur team having sushi and asahi/asake; we really loved the environment and would recommend coming back here again and again.  I still say Chaya is better located and adds a bit more umph, but this place still rocks!"
"5.0","Mad good Desi food, grill, love the burgers too. Really chill laid back environment. Everyone always seems happy here!!! Love the diverse customer base and convenient meat shop next door."
"5.0","When you have kids you learn to secure a seat at places when they might be busy. Entertained to find an empty-ish place today (Friday), made me feel a little silly. First time being here the location appeared impeccably clean and well organized. The open concept allows you to see the food being prepared which is cool. The burger was delicious! And the Brussels sprouts had great flavors. Fries were little and crispy! Pilsner was crisp and smooth with more of their menu focused on IPA, it was nice to have a single beer dedicated to those of us with less hop desires. Hubby enjoyed sampling their beers, as he told me they recently came into the beer scene. Definitely taking some crowlers on our way out."
"4.0","Just landed from orlando, checked into hotel and found our way to garden cafe....good thing we stopped! Food was great! Service was great! Outdoors was fantastic ! I should have tipped 20% but your order and then sit down and I didn't realize the wait staff is a real wait staff not just deliver your food!I would recommend! We had grilled shrimp, garden tacos w shrimp, salads and also chicken sandwich."
"5.0","AWESOME all day buffet for an affordable price! Its made with love too; They don't skimp on the quality like some other buffets. They always have the Indian favorites, tikka masala, saag paneer, and if you're VEGAN, you'll probably fall in love. They offer so many vegan options. A+"
"2.0","Disappointing.  The food was below average and the service was ok.  We were expecting a lot from this restaurant but it definitely did not deliver.  Pasta was not homemade and sauces mediocre at best.  Wine selection is very weak.  The outdoor seating is a redeeming quality."
"2.0","I've biked past this place enough times, but finally made it in to eat.  We were able to sit outside, which was nice.  And our server was quite friendly.  But the food...Our server suggested his favorite dish, which was an angel hair dish with spinach, chicken, and white wine sauce.  What I received reminded me of Mrs Grass soup.  The stuff that is a dried packet and you just add hot water to it."
"5.0","We picked this bar because it was listed as having great cocktails and they did not disappoint! My husband is super picky about his drinks and he was all smiles! we didn't have any entrees, just the browned butter and smoky salted popcorn and it was amazing.  The bar is beautiful with fresh flowers and candlelight. The atmosphere is so relaxing. We will be back!"
"2.0","Service took about an hour and half when the guy on phone said it would take 45 mins. Order from this place if you can enjoy waiting for your food that long"
"4.0","Such a cool spot! The food is quick, affordable, and delicious. It's the perfect place to take a brief intermission from your South Side excursions. Also they play awesome music like Sublime. Highly recommend!"
"5.0","With this being the last of the locations open, it's by far the best one to have stayed. With Bubba behind the bar you know you're in good hands. Now let's break down these sandwiches..... the bread is always local and fresh, the slaw is super tasty, the Russian dressing is the best addition to the star of the Sammy's Special.... the corned beef is the best around. There's not all that gelatinous fat, it's lean, juicy and super flavorful. This is the only place I miss when I'm on Vacay and my first craving when I get home.  Hands down my very favorite sandwich in Southwest PA"
"5.0","WOW. Just finished our first meal at Caffe Mona and it was AMAZING. Hands down one of the best breakfasts in Pittsburgh. Had no idea this gem existed. The service was warm, friendly and personalized. It felt like we were dining in Europe. We had the Mediterranean omelet, Chicken Caesar and South gourmet crepes. We will definitely be regulars from now on. And the French toast with Berries was beyond words! Loved it!"
"2.0","Sandwiches are small and expensive.  Ordered the 'Famous Special $8.99'  Definately not famous or special.  They say 'New York Style'.  Looks like they haven't been to New York during this century. In New York they are piled high and delicious. Don't believe me?  This place was completely dead during the lunch hour except for a couple old men sitting at the tables...  Eat somewhere else, seems like that's what everyone is doing"
"4.0","CHiKN is a great new restaurant for the Oakland area. It reminds me of bird on the run in East Liberty (Bird on the run is still much better). The chicken here is Nashville style - it's an oil based spice as opposed to a sauce based spice. It tends to run on the hot side as well - I got the medium spice level and it was pretty hot. The concretes are really good - especially good when you're looking to cool down your younger after eating really spicy chicken!"
"4.0","Location = awesome, its a side door and up some really cool stairwell with some great painted art on the walls Food = Ramen = on point and delicious"
"5.0","OMG! The chicken sandwich. Absolutely delicious and the beer is scrumptious too. This may be my new favorite place! Mmmmm"
"5.0","Yes! A great place with Quality!Yes there tea is not $.99 a cup is a little more on the expensive side but you have to remember they are ordering and serving quality team made right versus places that sell $.99 tea are just buying massive containers of tea bags that come to about five cents apiece maybeOverall quality service every time we come in also and the food is excellent too to be honest we come here often for the food more than even the Teatons of room for sitting and doing work also!"
"5.0","The ramen, the cocktail, the ambience. A+, Umami. I dined at the bar solo on a Friday night and was pleased at how lively this restaurant was thanks to the fact that a live DJ was in house. When in Pittsburgh, definitely make an appearance at Umami."
"4.0","I came here around 9pm on a Friday night. The entrance was somewhat hidden and you take a lot of stairs to get up to the actual restaurant. We did not have a reservation, but with only 2 people they found us a table within minutes. They don't have very much seating, so I would recommend getting a reservation.To be honest, I typically lean more toward eating sushi rolls, than traditional sushi. So I wasn't sure what I'd like, I started with a scallop hand roll, which was very good. Our waiter also suggested that we share the Sashimi Plate to get a taste for a variety of sushi... salmon, tuna, yellowtail, fluke, octopus, and striped bass. It was good.It's a unique place."
"1.0","So, I was out in this neighborhood at that point of the evening when all you want to do is have some food you really wouldn't want to eat sober, then drink a tall glass of water and get to sleep. This place looked very promising from the outside, a hole in the wall Italian joint that offered pizza by the slice, according to a small whiteboard in the window. So I walk in and there is no menu board. Hmm. I look around for a menu on the counter, or a carry out menu near the door or something. No and no. A middle aged man and woman behind the stop their conversation in another language (not Italian) and the guy asks 'What do you want'. Me: 'Pizza by the slice.' Him: 'We're all out.' Then we just kind of look at each other for a while, as I wait for him to offer an alternative, or to say that the next batch will be in X minutes. No luck however, so I just walk out. . . As I'm leaving, I notice one other item advertised on the white erase board: a Gyro special. So, now that I know they offer at least two types of food, I decide to try again. I return to the counter and this time the woman asks me what I want. I say 'A gyro' (pronounced 'yee-roh'). Her: 'A what?' Me: 'A yee-roh' Her: 'Wha?t'  Me: 'A Jie-roh.' OK, I know that ''Jie-roh' is the more common pronunciation amongst non-Greeks, but how do you actually work at a restaurant that serves this product and not even know there are two pronunciations? This is what we in the amateur restaurant review industry refer to as A Very Bad Sign. But after crossing this language barrier it turns out that they are in stock, and I get one to go.  How was my Jie-roe? Well, remember the gyros you got in the high school cafeteria, with the razor thin slices of pressed mystery meat, the flavorless limp white/yellow lettuce, one sad tomato and some white goo that has been prepared by someone who has never heard the word Tzatziki in their lifetime? It tasted like that. Other people seemed to have better luck with the pizza. That is the positive note I will end on."
"5.0","Outstanding Tacos!After hearing my wife rave about their tacos and nachos for months I had to see what all the hype was about for myself. The inside is fairly small which is a shame as in order to really enjoy their tacos you need to eat them freshly made. Maybe ten seats wrapped around the cooking area and maybe another three or four seats at the window. Lucky for us, the evening we went the place was almost completely empty at the time we arrived but filled up quickly after.As far as their taco choices go they offer about six different tacos. Carnitas (pork), Pollo (chicken), two types of ground beef tacos (Carne Molida and Americano), a Vegan taco and a Special Daily Taco Special each for $3 each served on either a flour or corn tortilla. On my first visit I went with a Carnitas, Pollo and Carne Molida taco. The Carnitas taco features slow smoked pork, Mexican Slaw, Pico de Gallo, Mexican Farmers Cheese and Cilantro & Lime. The Pollo taco features marinated chopped chicken, Avocado, Cholula Crema, Pico de Gallo, Mexican Farmers Cheese and Cilantro & Lime. The Carne Molida taco features Spicy Ground Beef, Bell Peppers, Jalapenos, Cholula Crema, Mexican Farmers Cheese and Cilantro & Lime. Of the three the Carnitas was my favorite by far! The perfectly cooked pulled pork was so flavorful. It was melt in your mouth tender. The Pollo taco was a close second as the marinated chicken was very flavorful as well. The Carne Molida taco was good but not as much of a stand out as the other two.On my second visit I had the Carnitas Nachos which for $5 is a stellar bargain as I was completely stuffed after I finished them. Some of the best nachos I have had in a long, long time. I usually don't frequent The South Side or Carson Street very often, but Doce Taqueria will be changing that for sure!"
"5.0","Best tea room in Pittsburgh! Great place for breakfast or lunch as well. I have been here quite a few times since it opened earlier this year and I keep coming back because of the loose tea selection, and bright and welcoming atmosphere."
"1.0","This was my first time here and I will never go back.  My hubby and I were excited to get alil dresses up and have some Italian and god did they mess that off. To start off when we walked in the place REEKED of piss. Like someone has literally just peed on the floor. Our waitress showed us to a booth in the back where they were scraps and trash under and around our table. I asked her for a drink list she informs me there isn't one k fine I move on. Then we get an appetizer the fried ravoli which was prices at 8$ but only came with four bite size pieces on a plate. That's it. Now onto the meal I order a tortellini and marinara and my husband got the tuna. Mine came out with random mixed veggies In it(which I just picked around) and my husbands came out fine except his sauces came in plastic cups(it was a 20$ dish). Oh and that's not the end of it. After telling the waitress that I didn't receive what I ordered we had to listen to her and the cook scream at each other while we at. She then have us our check and then disappeared. We waited until I finally stopped another waitress to cash us out. I paid 65$ all together and it should have been free."
"4.0","My go-to place for late night snackage. It's a small restaurant, so carry out or delivery is best. I usually order delivery on my way home so that it's there shortly after I am, and the pizza is always great. I like the sweetness that the sauce has. (Getting hungry thinking about it). ALSO, this place will deliver 6-packs of beer, so that's a great perk! Haven't tried anything but the pizza though."
"5.0","A great, independent eatery.  They have breakfasts of all description, freshly made and quite enormous, at reasonable prices.  Bring a big appetite.  Their omelots will fill you to bursting even if you don't eat the huge slices of bread and hash browns that come with them.  And,  hey, the coffee is good, too."
"5.0","I absolutely LOVE Tamarind's buffet. They have some of the most authentic Indian food in Pittsburgh, which a good mix of South and North Indian dishes. The last time I went there, I ate so much, my stomach nearly popped. :-)"
"5.0","This is a really quaint restaurant that I've been meaning to try for a while. Came here on a weekday night and was seated pretty quickly with a party of 4. On Wednesdays they have student night so bring your student ID and get 50% off your second entree! We got a serving of garlic naan, chicken tikka masala, chicken korma, and one of the dosas. Everything came as a pretty sizable portion and was REALLY tasty and authentic. The prices are also really good for the amount of food they give you and for everything we got, it was only $40 total with a 20% tip. This is now my favorite Pittsburgh restaurant!"
"5.0","Feels darn good to find a Hardee's near me! They are the #1 fast food joint, ya dig?! If yinzers got COUNTRY HAM on that breakfast menu I would be there daily. It must be a southern thang, but it needs to catch on 'cross 'Merica already. During my few (soon to be many) trips here,  I have been greeted by a friendly face and pleasant service. Heck, if they had a bar I would try to live here."
"3.0","This type of pizza is thin, chewy, oily and has very little tomato sauce in it which is pretty typical for a pizza place. What I enjoyed the most was the flavorful oil in the pizza - not the healthiest pizza but pretty flavorful nonetheless. Although I enjoyed the pizza overall and the customer service was quick, I strongly feel that the pizza should be accurately depicted on their menu and that the price is not the best value. To be fair, the picture of the pizza that they advertise on their menu looks nothing like the pizza that they give you and I find that disingenuous. Although the slice they gave me was pretty good, I still found the price of 3.50 per slice without toppings to be a bit much. It was a rather large slice vertically however the thickness was thin, which again, was not how the picture on the menu was depicted at all."
"2.0","Went during lunch time and it was busy, but the cashier was pleasant and took my order quickly and accurately. The wait for food was a little bit longer than I expected (~13 minutes) and I could've gone next door and gotten some Thai Iced Tea had I not have the buzzer given to me. Once I received my order I briefly checked to make sure that my order was correctly filled and then left to meet a friend elsewhere since all the tables and seats were full. What I was not expecting, was a charred Chicken Frontega Panini -- despite the busyness of a weekday I cannot believe they had the audacity to serve such inedible food. though I had a to-go order and the priority is to provide fast service, I would've rather waited an extra 5 minutes for an edible Frontega chicken panini - as long as I was told (otherwise I'd be in the dark about the extra long wait for a measly Frontega chicken). By all means, the other half of the panini was great, but would've been better had I got to enjoy the entire sandwich that I paid $8 for."
"3.0","Pamela's is a staple and a classic to the Pittsburgh region. I've eaten at 3 locations: Oakland, Shadyside, and the Strip District. There's usually a line and no reservations, and they only take cash. I usually get the banana chocolate chip hotcakes, and sometimes will get just the chocolate chip hotcakes with whipped cream which are both equally delicious! The service is good as well, as they bring you waters the moment you sit down, and ultimately they are trying to get tables their food and ultimately get new customers in the door."
"2.0","It's edible.  The tacos are pretty small and the price is not great.  The burritos are more expensive and not as good as those from some other restaurants in the area.  I don't eat here anymore."
"4.0","Once you reach the building that Umami resides in, going up the stairs to the top floor is like an experience. With each flight of stairs that you climb, the wallpaper pattern changes and each design is beautiful. The staircase is a bit narrow and the steps are rather steep but it takes less than 5 minutes to reach the 3 flights of stairs. Once you emerge, the set up is small and cozy with a bar on your left and the kitchen along the length of the restaurant. I really liked the aesthetics of the restaurant and it even translates to the presentation of the food. Food and Drink Ordered:* worth trying- [Suppai Shoga] : Beautifully presented. Tasted very refreshing and has a strong ginger taste which could be a hit or miss for some people. The foam on top had a lemony taste but I missed some of the other flavors in the drink. - [Karaage] : Tastes like the description: fried chicken. The meat was not dry, which was a plus but I've definitely had better. I actually preferred dipping it in the takoyaki sauce rather than the sauce that it was provided with. - [Takoyaki*] : Tasted like good classic takoyaki.- [Robatayaki] : Because we couldn't decide on which robatayaki to order, my friends and I ordered one skewer of the bacon quail egg, chicken heart, and Wagyu beef tenderloin. This appetizer was a bit disappointing because there wasn't any flavor for the chicken heart and Wagyu beef tenderloin. The Wagyu beef was also a bit tough. The bacon quail egg was delicious but it's usually pretty difficult to have a flavorless bacon quail egg. - [Chirashi bowl*] : Overall, the taste was good. My friend said that this chirashi bowl was better than the one at Chaya Japanese Cuisine. Some of the fish tasted very fresh but others did not. Not to say that the fish tasted bad but it wasn't phenomenal. I did like the addition of the pipette; it controlled the amount of soy sauce necessary for the fish so that the flavors of the fish weren't smothered. - [Tonkotsu Ramen*] : The ramen was very delicious, especially the broth which had a very strong sesame taste if you're into that. The only downside is that the pork ribs were a bit dry.Would I go back? : Of course! I believe that food should look as good as it tastes and for the most part, Umami hits that mark. I like all the options that Umami provides. Even after ordering five items, excluding the drink, there are so many other items that I wanted to try. This place is really nice to good with friends so that you can try a little bit of everything for a reasonable cost. The only reason I did not give a 5 star rating was because not everything that I ate hit the mark but if I could on Yelp, I would give Umami a 4.5 rating because it was pretty darn good."
"4.0","A great Pittsburgh themed restaurant on the North Shore! Inside there is a dining room and a bar area. The bar area is covered in tvs to watch sports and signed memorabilia covers the walls. I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwhich. The sandwhich came fried with a nice crunchy breaded layer. Coating the chicken is a delicious spicy buffalo sauce, not overly hot, but just a good spicy kick. I also got pepperjack cheese on top, which added to the good flavor. Lastly, you can get either blu cheese or ranch on the side to dip your sandwich in or place on it. Sandwiches also come with fries, which were fresh and seasoned nicely. Prices are reasonable too, so this is a great lunch or dinner option pregame or when you're spending the day on the North Side."
"5.0","Got the Fan Favorite - TexMex Omelette. Was a pretty satisfying omelette. Never tasted anything like it before. Would recommend. The banana-walnut-hotcake was also very good. The food came out extremely quick. I left satisfied."
"3.0","First, notice this little place has an application for liquor license on the door.  Just what this area needs, another liquor license!  Did not realize that Gennaro's had such a large menu.  Lots of pasta, sandwiches, salads...not sure how such a small place can have such an extensive menu, but I digressed.  The pizza sauce has herbal favors to go with the cheese on a thinner crust that was toasted just right on the bottom.  Also, the menu has deep dish pizza."
"2.0","I'm not a fan of the Panera in Oakland.  Often when I have been there the salads have no dressing on them or are missing a vital piece.  Last time I went I ordered a breakfast sandwich on a bagel and they pressed it on a panini press making it flat as a pancake and burnt.  Very unappealing."
"5.0","This restaurant is amazing in so many ways! The food is incredible - we got the buffet tonight and loved the baklava, hummus, chicken tikka masala, chana masala, and grape leaves. And the staff were so kind and friendly. This is actually my first Yelp review ever - I just had to share how awesome this place is. I'll be coming back next time I'm in Pittsburg!"
"5.0","I was incredibly surprised by Pamela's.  I thought the food was good (and unique!), the service was great, and the price wasn't too rough.  I went on a Wednesday morning, and it was relatively empty, but I'm aware it gets insanely crowded on the weekends so you'd have to plan ahead.  Definitely going to stop here again with my parents :)"
"5.0","Wow- what a great surprise! Great, interesting beers of all kinds (IPA, sour etc) and amazing food. We ate the tomato and summer squash salad, blueberry goat cheese toast, quinoa and chickpea curry, red lentil falafel, corn, and ham sandwich. All the dishes were delicious and fresh with good portions. I can't wait to go back!"
"1.0","The food was extremely greasy and the sauce was running off of the chicken. The mac and cheese was disappointing. Would not recommend."
"4.0","Finally got the chance to explore the menu at Cinderlands, after visiting their bar several times. Cinderlands always has some great beers on tap, and they've been taking the Pittsburgh craft beer scene by storm, in an impressively short period of time. They always have delicious craft cocktails on the menu as well.The ambiance at Cinderlands is great! The decor is clean and kind of cozy-industrial. When the weather is warm, you're able to sit at the double-sided open window at the storefront. I've been wanting to try their fried chicken sandwich for weeks, and I finally got the chance. It was a bit spicy for me, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. My boyfriend was excited to stop by on a Wednesday for their SSBC (super secret burger club). This weeks burger offering was a triple decker burger with jalapeños, marinara, and mozzarella. It was fantastic, but a bit pricey at $18. I'm always impressed by Cinderlands, especially the gourmet food they're able to crank out of their tiny kitchen. I'm super pumped for their new warehouse location to open!"
"5.0","Just picked up takeout from V3. I ordered the Barbeque and my wife had pepperoni with cheese. This was the best flat bread pizza we've had in Lawrenceville over the last two months! The crust was perfect and the toppings were tasty! This is a chain that offers several types of dough, including gluten free. We had the regular flatbread crust. All pizzas are $8. Gluten free is a couple dollars more. After reading some of the poor reviews we were hesitant to try it out but we were pleasantly surprised. The store was empty at 8pm and I think the two people working were owners or managers. The area behind the counter was a bit messy and there were only about 4 different bottled drinks to select from the cooler. They did have a decent selection of soda fountain drinks. We will definitely go back. It's hard to beat excellent quality at less than $20 for two people. FYI - We didn't order drinks because it was takeout.  Expect an update to the review if there is an issue with consistency as noted by other posts."
"4.0","Nice place with great food. Curry goat is very yummy, naan is tasty too. Maybe I will try sonething more spicy next time. Love it!"
"1.0","Just so so. Left hungry. sushi was small portions at large prices. They must have worked hard to slice the sushi so thin. Spent too much for too little. The quality wasn't anything to write about so I won't."
"3.0","Came here before a Pitt football game. We ordered 3 things:  firecracker shrimp, deep fried hoagie, and the buffalo chicken sandwich. The shrimp was by far the best. It comes in a creamy sauce, which is unusual, but flavors were delish. My daughter enjoyed her chicken sandwich. The hoagie was very heavy. It came with tater tots, which were cold and tasted like the ones I buy from the frozen food section of the grocery store. All in all, I'd say the food overall was just OK. On top of that, we waited an hour for our food, which normally is a problem but was OK here just because  we got to the game so early!"
"5.0","It's a little pricey but the food was great. I enjoyed my seafood pasta and the apple tart was definitely worth the order. I sampled all of my friends food and it was equally delicious. The vibe is real uptown  sheek if you get my drift but the music is Mello and chilled. Definitely a good look for a date."
"4.0","Stopped in for lunch while in the Strip District with my family. Had the #7 which was enormous. Ate half for lunch and half for dinner. Sandwich was delicious but I don't want to think about the calories. Service was good. Not a fancy place. Great stop if you're hungry and looking for a big sandwich for short money."
"4.0","So I have had Bulldawg's a couple of time in the past and yesterday I was at Grist House and finally realized how much I appreciate them! I love hot dogs. LOVE. But I have a huge gripe about most shops around the city...they all have these great hot dogs...awesome toppings...and then this sad little bun that isn't anything special. I ordered a hot dog that had bacon, bbq and provolone on it...gosh....it was soo incredibly good and the best part? the chewiest hot dog bun. I mean...formidable. I respected that bun. The hot dog is also really quality as well. The toppings were well balanced. I loved every second."
"3.0","'Average' is the best description for Chinatown Inn. A very friendly staff, the take Amex,great cocktails, nice presentation and generous amount of food can usually one one over. However, there was something lacking with flavor in all three dishes.We ordered Shredded Chicken with garlic, General Tsao's beef and Pork Dumplings. All lacked flavor and were somewhat bland. All were hot, came nicely arranged and looked very appetizing. When you took a few bites, it was edible, but I think the presentation raised my expectations prior to taking a bite.Would I go back, probably not. If I lived or was in the area and craved Chinese one night would I go back, probably yes but with much lower expectations."
"4.0","I've only been for the dinner buffet but it's been good enough that I've been several times, leaving each time fuller than the last. This buffet has a smaller selection than others I've been to but the quality and taste of the dishes is AWESOME. You even get your own basket of naan with the buffet price (which is very affordable). Service is dependable too!"
"4.0","Doce is one of my favorite taco places in the burgh! Tacos are $3 and they have a few options. The actual location is pretty small so not good for big groups! We normally come for lunch and it can get pretty busy. I love the nachos with beef! It's a good portion size and normally fills me up! They have different non alcoholic beverages that are bottled. The service is fast and a great place to go in and out in a short period of time! Recommend if you are looking for a small local taco stop in the Southside!"
"5.0","I really enjoyed their pad kee mow and duck curry. My friend and I shared these two, plus two appetizers and we had some leftovers. Level 5 spicy for pad kee mow wasn't very spicy for us, even though we were told it would be pretty spicy. But we do really like spicy food, so I'm curious about higher levels. The prices were so, so great for such great-tasting food, and the service was really nice too!"
"4.0","Update! They have chai tea for lunch now!!! Finally!! I must say, the food is really tasty and value wise this is an AWESOME place! You won me back!"
"5.0","For years I had longed to take on the RoethlisBurger, but Peppi's hours aren't the most convenient for me. That is until a Saturday evening at Altar Bar with Icarus Witch and Kamelot caused Kay and I to track down dinner in the Strip District. And there it was, Peppi's. And they were...open?'Yeah, 'til 8PM,' a guy behind the counter said. 'But the sign says...''Oh, ignore that. What'll it be, man?' Kay was frightened of the RoethlisBurger, so when I ordered it, she ran to The Clown across the street. After the fellow took my order, I was given a ticket, and was told to sit down and relax. As I waited, I took in the surroundings, gazing at the sports memorabilia and photos of patrons both ordinary and famous. Just as hunger pangs assailed my belly, there it was, enveloped in a paper plate in front of me: A homonculous of loose meat a la Maid-Rite gone malevolent. Ground beef, hot sausage, onions, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, scrambled eggs, and 'Merican cheese were all packed into a bread that was as flaxen as a Valkyrie and as airy as the morning mist. Upon doing some research I've found that it is called a Portuguese Roll, and it is pulchritudinous. This behemoth of a breakfast sandwich dazzled my tongue with its spice, filled my stomach amply with its bulky, chunky  proteins, and soothed me with its fresh, fundamental vegetables, all of it held together with that amazing roll of rolls that threatens to make Italian bread passe via its sublime texture alone. 'Tis the greatest sloppy joe to ever emerge from a steaming flattop. P.S. I found nothing 'shabby' or 'greasy' or 'dirty' or 'loud' about Peppi's. The service was friendly, the restaurant itself was clean, the atmosphere was quiet, and the sandwich was triumphant. If Primanti Brothers has a true parallel, it is Peppi's."
"5.0","Check out the downtown location of this top patisserie in the 'Burgh (tied in my opinion with Jean Marc in Millvale).  It's better than Lawrenceville, because you don't have to line up as far, you get some additional lunch choices, like soups, and you can sit down to eat.  Otherwise, all the classics you expect.I went at a slow time and the service had a little more of a relaxed vibe."
"1.0","This is the worst example of sushi I have had the displeasure of trying. Shabby decor ill mannered staff and the food were atrocious. The food was over embellished masking the flavor and actual quality and making a mockery of Japanese cuisine known for its artful display using less allowing the tastes and quality to speak for themselves. If boiler plate sushi is your thing with no respect to tradition or formal training as is evident here, then by all means enjoy. But if you seek sushi prepared by a chef with knife skills, presentation skills, and an understanding of what his role is then run! This is not the place. Thankfully a lifetime in Japan has given me the cultural experience to make the distinction. I would give less than a zero if I could but it seems I am forced to give at least one star"
"3.0","Their food is AMAZING but their service needs some work. They seem to be understaffed and frazzled when waiting on tables on the weekends during brunch hour. I also can't stand that they give you TINY water bottles for water, no tall glasses. Also, when sitting on the patio, don't get the tables next to the door because you will hear it SLAM a million times. However, their food is so wonderful and their espresso is crazy good! I will keep coming back for the food and cool umbrella patio but I wish they could step up their game a little bit."
"3.0","It is really pricey here and for the amount that they charge the food taste just OK so I was not overly blown away"
"2.0","I've been to the original location in Harmony and never had a bad experience. Hopefully this place will end up giving the same service. Unfortunately the rosemary fries came out like warm and very soggy and the fried chicken had a nice taste to it but had way too much breading and always fell off the chicken. Also... they don't put any pricing on their cocktail list. So I have no clue if I'm paying 6.00 or 15.00 for my drinks."
"5.0","My husband and I came here to have a casual and quick dinner this evening - we really liked it! We ordered a chicken panini with fries and a beta combo, and we shared both. The portions were good - we were pretty hungry so finished almost everything. While both orders were good, the chicken panini was my favorite, and I definitely plan on getting it again next time. Also, the employees were very friendly!"
"3.0","Pamela's has big diner-sized portions of hearty, greasy food at reasonable prices. We had the crepe pancakes, burger and chorizo hash with eggs.  The crepe pancakes are plate sized, thinnish pancakes with deliciously and addictively crispy (fried) edges that lure you into eating more and more, even you're stuffed. The chorizo hash was spicy and delicious but pretty heavy, especially with the 3-egg scramble that accompanied it - toast also came with it but honestly I hate wasting food and wished I had asked them not to bring me any- it was excessive.  The burger looked good, and the heaping mound of onion rings along side it were crispy fried and tasty.  Not the best food ever but it hit the spot, and then some."
"5.0","Peppi's is the hidden gem of Pittsburgh, this place gives primantis a run for its money. The quality of the delicious sandwiches that are made to order and affordable. The gentleman working was so kind to my friend and I, he even gave us customer reward cards for when we come back, and we definitely will."
"4.0","Firecracker shrimp was pretty good. I had that with a side salad for my lunch and I was pretty happy with my choice. My friend had a chicken sandwich and it was good. His kid had the cheesy fries which she just picked at, you know kids...The place is really nice and conveniently located down the street from the stadium. Bathrooms and restaurant was clean! Good service and good food."
"3.0","We recently moved to Pittsburgh and wanted to try a good sushi restaurant. After reading the reviews we decided to try out Kiku.The place is a little tricky to find if you're not familiar with the area. Restaurant seemed nice and everyone was very friendly. Although the sushi wasn't horrible, it wasn't that great either. I'm not sure if we caught them on a bad night considering it was Sunday. They seemed sloppy and rushed. Not a lot of care was given into the rolls as they were falling apart. Ingredients within the rolls didn't taste fresh either nor were they consistent within the same roll. Overall, I would try it again at some point but after I've tried other places first."
"4.0","I stopped in this past Saturday for coffee and I'm so glad I did. The space used to occupy Vanilla Pastry Studio and still has the cute, modern atmosphere which was very welcoming. The two women who worked there greeted us and told us about the two coffees of the day. I had the Nutcracker, a blend of cinnamon, almond, and sweet cream which proved to be a great holiday coffee to start the season! For lunch, I tried the Southwestern wrap from their amazing list of sandwiches. The wrap came nicely grilled from the panini press and was filled with the perfect balance of fresh spinach, tomatoes, cheese, and chicken breast. It came with a side of potato chips (or you can choose potato salad), and drink (I chose coffee) for under $9.Our server brought it to our table and made sure we had everything we needed. She didn't rush us and answered all of our questions.They also offer homemade pastries, ice cream, gelato, and fresh-pressed juices. The next time I stop by, I hope to try some of their sweets. They are incredibly nice, the food was delicious, and I hope they get more business."
"5.0","Food is well worth the money spent great quality! The lobster fries were amazing with the lobster bisque on-top.  Nothing like I have ever had before."
"4.0","delicious, quick, and healthy, i would recommend this place for lunch and i saw they also have mobile ordering which is a huge plus! i got the bamboo bowl and it was so flavorful and packed with veggies, i will definitely be going back and would like to try some of the other menu options. the atmosphere is also very vibrant and fun if you have time to sit and eat there."
"5.0","Went here for my birthday dinner and couldn't have been more thrilled! Two words- STOLI DOLI. Our server, Rob, was amazing and couldn't have been more helpful with explaining the menu. Ordered the filet mignon and although it was a little more rare than I would have preferred, it still melted in my mouth and was overshadowed by the fact the lobster mac n cheese (minus the lobster) was perfection. One side was suitable enough for my husband and I, we ended up bringing the rest home for the most expensive leftovers we've ever had. Definitely make it a point to come here for any special occasion!"
"5.0","Food is a bit over priced for what it is. Trendy spot, hipster atmosphere. I love their egg custard as it is one of my favorite comfort food, they get the consistency and flavor very well. The noodle dishes are big enough as an entree for one person, but the ramen is kinda oily. They have good specials everyday so check with the hostess before you order."
"5.0","Little Italy Days- a MUST see when in Pittsburgh. Rather than eat the so-so food on the street though, my friend & I decided to have a late dinner at Alexander's for a delicious Italian dinner. We ordered the chicken parm with angel hair pasta and marinara and split the portion between the two of us. We also had a side salad, the wedding soup, and some bread with our meal, as well as a glass of chardonnay. The salad was delicious and we received a generous portion as a side salad. The bread was delicious and fresh, the wedding soup was divine and the chicken parm was incredible. Even with splitting one dinner portion between the two of us, we still went home with leftovers. It was delicious! Service was wonderful as well. You can't go wrong with Alexander's! Highly recommend!"
"5.0","After a long day at school on the North Side, I traveled my usual route back to the East on E. Ohio St. Traffic was unusually hectic so I had time to gaze around at my surroundings. That's when I noticed this large store front with a neat interior. I parked my car and walked into the coolest tea and coffee shop I've seen in Pittsburgh. Really sweet customer service and awesome interior. The teas were just as good. I ordered the Lavenade (lavender lemonade) and a green tea. Definitely will go back soon"
"1.0","I ordered chicken biryani through seamless app.and their biryani tasted like sambar rice. They really need to improve a lot. A huge disappointment."
"5.0","Tasty, delicious and friendly service!!  Great little taco stand in the middle of the Strip District.  Cash only."
"4.0","I live on Mt Washington and love going to the Summit for a drink. They have a long list of cocktails that are creative and use good quality ingredients. Some change seasonally and others stay on the menu year round. I think my favorite is the Spicy Paloma (tequila, fresh squeezed grapefruit juice, and jalapeño). My husband is a total sucker for the Old Fashioned here. They also have a nice selection of wine.I think my favorite aspect of this place is the atmosphere. When the weather is nice, they open the windows that surround the space and it's totally open air. They also have a big stack of board games that you can play while you're there if you're so inclined. IMO, the only downside is the prices. The cocktails and food are expensive, especially compared to other places in Mt Wash. I recommend going during happy hour from 5-7pm on weekdays - the house cocktails are $6 and beer is $1 off."
"5.0","I ordered a burger, a two chicken tender sandwich and wings. The burger: I requested for my burger to be medium rare but my burger arrived medium. It still had tons of moisture. The flavor was perfect. The wings: They were perfectly cooked. They were crispy on the outside and perfectly juicy within. They were tossed with what i only can describe as a 'granulated garlic, white pepper wing dust'. Whatever seasoning blend it was gave it tremendous flavor, and I'd love to get a bottle of that seasoning blend. The fries: They were perfectly cooked as well. They were nice and moist on the inside, and slightly snappy on the out. They were also tossed with the same dust used on their wings. The chicken sandwich: The tenders were juicy on the inside and slightly crisp on the outside. They were perfectly cooked and the flavor was delicious! Overall: I would order from this place again. I wish i had asked for a menu. I enjoyed my food very much."
"5.0","The food here is excellent, the service is very quick, the staff is marvelously attentive and checks the progress of patrons frequently."
"2.0","Decent but terribly inconsistent food. I've had some great dishes and some terrible ones, I love chaat and 3 out of 4 times it was great, but once it was just a fried greasy mess (in a bad way, not in the good way it usually is.) Once the matar paneer was great, once it was oversalted and the peas were just plain bad. I don't know how they do it, but it's a coinflip between good food and an oversalted overcooked bowl.Either way, portions are generous."
"5.0","The BEST tacos in Pittsburgh. My girlfriend is a connoisseur of all things Hispanic- the culture, the food, everything. We've been to 8 Latin American countries between the two of us and we both agree that Edgar's taco stand has the best tacos we've tasted. I recommend the chorizo. Oh, ad he has horchata! A must try for anyone who enjoys authentic foods."
"5.0","In town for a couple of days and stopped in to check out Cinderlands.  I didn't eat, just sat at the bar...  the beer is amazing, I tried 3 and they are all well executed. They've got a style for pretty much any taste and they do some incredible stuff with single origin coffee, try the stack overflow coffee double IPA if available, it's awesome, never had anything like it!  Guy next to me got a burger that looked legit"
"4.0","We started with the pork rinds - new experience.  Light fluffy ... old bay seasoning? Could use some ranch dressing. Was served with lemon wedges.  Pretty good.The arugula salads were very good.  We had the artichoke pizza, beef special, and linguine with bacon and blue cheese for dinner.  Everyone would reorder their meals.For dessert, we split the carrot cake.  We all got a spoonful.  Great meal will definitely return for more."
"5.0","Excellent! We found Caffe Mona on Google and their top rating brought us across town for the best breakfast in Pittsburgh!  Completely awesome. Here is what we three had: Portabello Mushroom crepe with extra (and generous) spinach, South Omelette, Fig and Brie French Toast. Coffee was great. (We are still debating whose choice was best.) Service was outstanding - very attentive and kind. Hint: Check out the back patio with fanciful umbrellas to provide a bit of shade as you eat outside."
"4.0","I was staying at a hotel in downtown Pittsburg and the restaurant was closed, so I was handed a pamphlet to Genoa. I ordered the spinach chicken pizza in medium. They said I would have to come downstairs to get it but they ended up delivering to my room which was awesome. Delivery guy was very nice asked several times if i needed anything else. I had looked this place up on yelp after ordering and was a little weary after seeing reviews. However! I was pleasantly surprised. I judge a pizza by if i want to eat the crust or not. Let's just say I ate it all (not in one sitting ) but the toppings were packed on and the flavor was great. The side of ranch it came with was really tasty as well. I just re-heated some pieces for lunch today and it was still just as good. The portion to price ratio was very reasonable. I would totally order from here again."
"3.0","The chicken itself was good, but even the mildest level was way too spicy for me. Just a heads up to anyone else who can't tolerate spicy food. I had the tenders and they were HUGE. I should've ordered three instead of five. EVERYTHING has seasoning on it, even the fries and mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was creamy and delicious and a welcome respite from the saltiness of the chicken, even with the seasoning. Also this place clearly caters to college students, because the hip hop music was extra loud and definitely not family friendly."
"4.0","A very solid choice for Thai food in Pittsburgh.  Family-run, reasonable prices, good food.  The noodle dishes I have sampled so far--Pad Thai, Chiang Mai Mee, and the spicy Tom Yum noodle soup (which, let me tell you, is a truly amazing hangover cure) have all been excellent.Some of the appetizers I've had here haven't been the best, but overall you can expect solid quality from the entrees.  They often have candy and fruit for you to take with you when you leave!  And the staff is generally very friendly and helpful."
"3.0","Food: Prince of India has an expansive menu consisting of everything you would expect from an Indian restaurant, and they also appear to have a buffet. We didn't order the buffet, so I can't comment about what is on it or when it is offered beyond confirming that a buffet option does exist. There are many meat and seafood options, and there is a menu page devoted exclusively to vegetarian items, one of the biggest vegetarian selections among Pittsburgh Indian restaurants that I've seen. We started with the Dall (lentil) soup, which was steaming hot and loaded with lentils and flavor. We also ordered the garlic naan, which was just as good as any other naan we've had in the city. For an appetizer, we tried the Samosa Chat which are samosas smothered in chick peas, tomatoes and sauce. There weren't many samosas (maybe 2 small ones), but there was an abundance of chick peas, and the sauce covering them was the best part of the entire dinner. The lead-up to our entrees was impressive, but we were slightly disappointed by the main courses. We ordered the Baingen Aloo, which was surprisingly bland and had little to no flavor or spice. We also ordered the Vegetable Mango Curry, which had considerably more flavor, but wasn't anything special. Entrees are ordered on a spiciness scale of 1-10, and the 7 I ordered was accurate; very spicy but not overwhelming. Overall, nothing we tried was bad, although the entrees left something to be desired after the excellent soup and appetizer.Price: Prices are very reasonable, particularly the entrees. The most expensive vegetarian entree was $10.99, and the majority were cheaper. The portion sizes are smaller than most Indian restaurants, but there is more than enough to eat your fill and likely bring some home. The soup was huge for only $2.99, and the appetizer, which was $4.99, was probably bigger than either entree.Drinks: There is a full bar and multiple beer selections, which is different than most of Pittsburgh's Indian restaurants, and definitely as asset. We ordered bottles of Taj Mahal, which we hadn't tasted before, and were surprised by how good it was. The menu also includes typical Indian non-alcoholic drinks like mango lassi and chai tea.Atmosphere: The dining room is large with tables for parties of all sizes. There was a group of 20+ sitting down the center of the room, so they can accommodate very large groups. The location directly on Fifth Avenue in Oakland makes parking tricky, particularly on weekend evenings. Overall, the atmosphere and decor are comfortable and casual.  Service: Our waiter was very attentive, filling our water glass almost obsessively. He spoke English, but not excellent, and struggled to answer some of our questions about the menu. Our soup and appetizers came together, which we didn't consider ideal, and our entrees were out before we had finished any of the earlier courses. But we definitely didn't have to wait for anything, including the bill.(+): fair prices, good food, good service(-): although nothing was particularly wrong, nothing was spectacularWould I go back again? Probably for lunch to get the soup and appetizer again, or, if giving dinner a second chance, I would try a more standard Indian entree like Chana Masala."
"4.0","My Dad only turns 70 once. I asked him what he wanted for his birthday, and he said a night at the Pirates game with all of his kids. So that's what he got. Since the Parents don't know the city that well. They asked for suggestions on where to eat near the park. We decided on Grille 36. It was CRAZY busy when we got there, but they quickly got us a table for five. We sat down and our waiter was there in a jiffy. He didn't tell us his name, unfortunately. But he was amazing. We quickly had our drinks, and refills. I had been previously to Grille 36, and recommended the Fried Cheeseburger. So, everyone but dad got that. Haha! It was still as good as I remembered. Dad got fish and chips, and he shared them with his favorite daughter..me. I'm a lucky girl. He really enjoyed it and ate the whole plate! Right before we were to get the check, the waiter came over and asked if we were going to the Pirates game, and we said, 'yeah, for dads birthday!' And ten minutes later, he came back out with a giant plate of brownies, ice cream and a little skewer on top, lit like a birthday candle. He sang a horrible rendition of Happy Birthday, but we didn't care. You could tell that it's something they don't usually do, but this guy went above and beyond to make sure my dads meal was special. So, thanks, nameless waiter. I hope I can take my dad back someday. Happy Eating!"
"5.0","Delicious treat during your afternoon in the strip district! The picadillo tacos are awesome! The savory flavor of the beef with the fresh pico de gallo and cool sour cream is tasty! The cheese and squeeze of lime at the end cut through the richness of the meat and sour cream and add a lot of flavor! I also love the use of the corn tortilla instead of flour tortillas! Always one of our stops in the strip district, and will always be one of my favorite tacos in Pittsburgh!!"
"3.0","This place serves a purpose if your looking for a cheap drink and bar food. They have quite a few draft beers.   The service is good but the atmosphere is pretty mellow and unimpressive.  I would only go back if there were no other bars in the area open."
"5.0","This is an absolute hidden gem. Really fresh, authentic and delicious japanese food. So glad I was able to visit this place in Pittsburgh. Good sashimi with a variety of fish types. Recommend the Sashimi Lover Deluxe for 2. Even the cuts were perfect thickness and the rice was delicious. I appreciate the noodles and the fried veggie tempura. Its a nice crisp taste even though its fried. The ambiance is perfect and they could seat a variety of party sizes. I recommend making a reservation for larger parties on the weekends.I love everything about this place! So excited to go back."
"5.0","The best Italian in Pittsburgh's Bloomfield area! I love the fact that they make their own pastas to order and my fav is Calamari over choice pasta! Delish fresh calamari not frozen hand breaded and sauce is superb! Like MAMA's! Last time I had restaurant Italian was in Brooklyn NY! This place reminded me of there! My fav desert is Cannoli but didn't see it on menu! I had small Italian coffee w shot of Annisette made whole dinner since it was cold outside! It took me 45 min to get their from SHills by access van but I used to live in Shadyside and would walk to Alexander's in the cold snow for Their pasta! You can make it yourself go buy all ingredients slave over stove but won't be same! Wish we in SHills had this other than Olive Garden which Id never will eat that phony food!"
"5.0","We found this place on Grub Hub and we LOVE IT! They have the best pizza and the wings are really good too! I highly recommend it!"
"5.0","What a great experience! My maid of honor planned an afternoon tea at this place and it was just perfect. First, I love the decor and openness of this cafe. The wood tables and the brick walls and the inviting couch make for what looks to be a great place to meet friends or get work done. The staff was so pleasant making sure we had everything we needed. They set up a large round table for us all to partake in high tea. The tea selection was great, but the food they brought out stole the show. The tiered risers held our many currant scones, mini sandwiches, and variety of desserts. Every thing I tried was so delicious. We left feeling so full and happy that we spent the afternoon there. I can't wait to go back for another experience trying one of their other meals and another adventurous tea!"
"3.0","Okay- Love China Town Inn but the last 3 times that I have gotten Shrimp Fried Rice it just wasn't up to par.  I was highly upset the last time... thinking it was a fluke... I hope they see this and step their game back up."
"2.0","I recently went here for the first time with family members.On the appearance level, this restaurant has a very suave upscale look. The lighting and decor make for a very pleasing atmosphere. Also, the waitstaff are very pleasant and hospitable.The downside of this restaurant is that the food is very overpriced considering the portions. I ordered the salmon ($35.00) which was served with a side of green beans. I asked if I also could have a side order of rice. I was given two scoups of sticky white rice and charged $6.00 extra. The salmon itself was good, but the serving was much TOO SMALL for a $35.00 charge.When I left the restaurant, I was still hungry. My food bill total for the entree, soft drink and tip was $50.00+.Bottom line: Not worth the money. If I'm going to spend $50.00 on a meal, the plate should be filled."
"2.0","I was excited to try Kiku due to the Yelp reviews when we stopped in Pittsburgh for a night en route to New York. Being a half Japanese woman living in Kentucky, I jump at the opportunity to get traditional Japanese at any chance I can get since my hometown is littered with sushi bars that specialize more in mayonnaise, fried, or spicy sauce laden fusion sushi rather than real Japanese food.  Kiku was definitely run by Japanese folk and the menu had the usual traditional fare. The food was pretty okay. We had the Agedashi Dofu which the broth was so mild it's taste didn't transfer well to the tofu. They garnished with green onion and daikon oroshi (grated radish) but didn't have the customary bonito flakes. They also charged a whopping $6 for probably a 2-1/2 ounce portion. I'd pay overblown prices for a good Agedashi Tofu, but this wasn't one. The Agedashi experience kind of defines the rest of our meal. Everything tasted okay but the prices were beyond ridiculous. We then realized we were in a touristy part of town and missed out on a lot of the amazing farm to folk fare in other areas. This place is meant to pull in hotel guests who aren't really looking for real culinary fare and are unaware they are getting raped by prices.  The tuna in our tuna roll was on it's way out, the smelt we ordered were just grilled with no sprinkle of sea salt or any kind of sauce--and again, a whopping $8 for three small fish. All sushi was ordered by the piece and about 20% more expensive they any other sushi bar I've been to outside of the Pacific Northwest, Tokyo, and NYC.  (Example: $6 for two pieces of salmon). The advertised 'mixed green salad' was cut with iceberg lettuce. The chawanmushi was bland and a small tea cup size. If you are charging $8 for chawanmushi, use real crab. At least snow crab. And throw in a ginko nut.  On the good side, the dressing was yummy, the salmon sushi was really fresh, and the service was decent. Overall, food is not awful but not exciting and the prices are beyond ridiculous for what you get."
"5.0","I come here for their Sunday buffet and they never disappoint. There are tandoori chicken is super great and they make it in a huge pan. Pate super authentic and I love their drinks and cracker bread as well"
"1.0","Awful, we went on Sat, October 5th. First off, there was no game they were not even half full, it took at least 15 mins to get a beer and Moscow mule. My mule had no lime in it and was ninety percent Rose's lime juice; undrinkable. My wife was served a beer in a plastic cup. Our lunches took 34 mins to come out, she ordered a steak salad and I ordered shrimp street tacos. I told our waiter to cancel then the food came out ice cold with hard rice pilaf, and they forgot my fries!!  Mr. Stampo and ownership needs to train from  the top down, I've been to many places and this is a disaster. The manager did not ever come over to apologize, he had our poor waiter do the dirty work, come on!! Plus our table was where the sound control is and a crowd of confused employees kept congregating there and bumping into my wife. Do not put a table there!!! I will be sure to tell everyone I know to not enter your establishment, word of mouth nowadays is not good. They did however comp my meal, but I didn't eat it."
"5.0","My girlfriend and I were searching for a brunch place earlier today as we were making Sunday plans and eventually we settled on Cinderlands.  So, after hitting up the Squirrel Hill farmer's market, we meandered--thanks to a random road closure and Waze seeming to no understand Pittsburgh--our way to Cinderlands.  We were greeted by the lovely staff there and our waiter gave us our menus with a smile, immediately apologizing for being 'a little over energized because i'm over-caffeinated,' which made both of us laugh.  He was quite attentive throughout our meal and super insightful on the beers currently on tap (she had the POG Whipper & I got the Grizzled Canary) both of which we loved and completely recommend if you enjoy very fruit flavored beers.Then came our food.  Our waiter gave us several recommendations, but we ended up settling on the French Toast and Smoked Fish Scramble (for her and myself respectively) with an order of the potatoes to split.  We like trading bites of each others meal, as we often pick things the other was considering when we eat out, and after an initial bite each on the potatoes we were hooked on them and the rest of our food.  The description of the potatoes, in my opinion, does not do that simple dish (which perfectly fits as an appetizer) justice. My Smoked Fish Scramble was simple and wonderful and is strongly recommended as well.  But, it was the French Toast that pushed us both over the edge.  The bread was fluffy and savory and the 'lime curd' as well as the peach and mint took the flavors of the dish to a whole new, very refreshing and summery, level that we both have been raving about all day.  Hands down this was one of our favorite brunches from the summer and in recent memory and we both also loved the overall aesthetic in the back section by the bar.  We'll be back!"
"2.0","First of all I'm a STEELER FAN but when it comes to food that's a different story.The buffalo spicy wings were ok, quite dry. The side of fries had just a hand full on a large plate and the 12oz rib eye steak had no favor when I added salt the shakers were wet so there was no salt that came out.The bathroom had no toilet paper in 4 stalls and there were no napkins.1 star for personable customer service and another star because it's a STEELER restaurant."
"2.0","Though the ambiance is nice, we were throughly unimpressed with the food and service. I ordered eggs, they were completely cooked through and rubbery. Came with 2 slices of American cheese (yuck)! The other food was okay, but not worth the $40 check for 2. They also charged .50 for tiny water bottles that we had not ordered. Not satisfied, not coming back. Left a lot to be desired."
"1.0","Working downtown, Redbeards is a go to happy hour spot for me and my co workers. We called ahead as we always have and requested they reserve tables. We had a large party, about 15-20 ppl coming at various times. On the phone they said okay, as this has never been a problem. Well today we get there at 3:45 and as we walk up the steps a gentleman in a blue button down shirt who i assume was the manager starts shooing us back down the stairs telling us we cannot come up there until 4pm. This has never happened. When they finally let us upstairs they had ONE table with about 8 chairs even tho we told them ahead of time how many ppl we had. There were several empty tables surrounding us but we were told we couldn't take them because they were reserved for other people as they expected to be busy due to the pirate game. This was odd to me because we were paying customers and they were making us stand when there were empty tables available? Well no one ever came to occupy them so we ended up just sitting there because standing was getting old. Our waiter did his best considering but the manager was SO RUDE and it ended up being chaotic. I think we'll take our happy hours elsewhere."
"4.0","I love cafes and Cafe Raymond is such a nice addition to the strip! The interior is really warm and inviting with rustic vibes. You order your meal at the register up front and then take a seat indoors or outdoors. I came in between breakfast and lunch so I decided to order the veggie muffaletta sandwich to go. You could taste the freshness of the veggies and let me tell you it was delish! The sandwich came with grilled portobello, eggplant, zucchini, squash, roasted red pepper, olive salad, pesto and provolone on focaccia for $7.75. This sandwich was a lot bigger than I expected for the price. I am really excited to try their breakfast during my next visit. They also have a case filled with fresh pastries from scratch that look so yummy!"
"2.0","Stopped by today to get the number 7. Wait time to order at the counter was about 25 minutes. Wait time for the meal after ordering was about 10 minutes for the french fries show up at the table and another 35 - 40 minutes after that for the sandwich to show up. Just over an hour and a half for the total visit. Service here was extremely slow.The sandwich was pretty huge. I didn't feel the sandwich was worth the wait. Fries were great, but needed salt. Due to a lack of time in my schedule today, I filled up on the french fries waiting for the sandwich and was only able to finish a quarter of the sandwich and throwing the rest out. I don't see myself returning due to the sluggish service and the hour it took for a sandwich."
"2.0","I got the Madagascar vanilla cream cold brew... but it's just the regular cold brew with pumps of vanilla syrup... disappointed. Not worth it.. I even went to ask if this was correct and the girl just tells me it's suppose to be pumps of vanilla but I can add cream if I want... pictures online are deceiving"
"4.0","I haven't been here in many years, and it was a pleasant surprise. The food was great, and our server(Jonathan) was helpful, friendly and professional.  When I was trying to decide what to get, he was knowledgeable about the selections (and HIS favorites), and helped me choose. We began with an appetizer of calimari, which was cooked to perfection (NOT rubbery, like so many restaurants tend to serve). They have an awesome selection of unique salads, one of which I chose. My son ordered a pasta dish, which he thoroughly enjoyed. For dessert, we both got tiramisu, which is so often our choice wherever we go. My son and I agreed it was the best we ever had. It was served in a parfait glass, rather than on a plate in the traditional square,  and the cake portion was surrounded by a delicious mousse, garnished with tiny chocolate chips. An enjoyable experience,  all around! The entrees weren't outrageously priced, my son's pasta with clam sauce being $13.00, my asparagus and chicken salad $14.00(worth the price!) The tiramisu was $6.00 for each portion. Though it was clean and the atmosphere was nice, I do wish I didn't have to walk through the bar, especially as we were leaving,  as there was a customer who seemed to be acting rudely to the bartender. Also, my son and I agreed that we didn't want to sit under the table with the chandelier hanging over it, because the decorations on it looked old and dusty. Maybe they weren't, but they looked pretty musty."
"2.0","Great lunch catering. I couldn't recommend it enough--a variety of sandwiches, salads, cookies, chips--really impressive.I probably won't go back for dinner, though, and it pains me to say it because I love living in Bloomfield and I love Bloomfield businesses. A group of eight of us decided to check this place out for restaurant week, and even though the $25.15 menu didn't look all that impressive, we figured it would be a nice taste of what they had to offer.The meatballs were a bit dry and the sauce was a bit unimpressive. The salad was great (I love beets). The risotto was bland and undercooked. The pumpkin ravioli tasted like canned pumpkin pie filling; the cream-sauce was either not a good complement or not spiced well or something (I can't quite put my finger on it, and it wasn't bad, it was just...there). Before our meal, they brought out a white bean dip with some bread--this was the highlight of the night, aside from the wine we brought ourselves. Our waitress was extremely nice and down-to-earth, and kudos for being patient with our larger party.I guess my concern is that if you're going to bother offering a restaurant week deal, why wouldn't you serve something wonderful that you're especially proud of? A few of the people in our party ordered something off the menu rather than getting the special, and they really enjoyed their meals. They won't split large-party checks and only use up to four cards on one check. We also stayed past our welcome--by the time we left, all staff were in the back, and we were alone in the front of the restaurant."
"5.0","They make the best pizza I can buy.  We get one a week ( during Football, basketball , hockey , and the Olympics, and during special holidays.  What I am saying is, we order a lot of pizza. Before we found Wiseguys, it was a gamble. Sometimes the pizza we would buy from many different parlors  was ok, and other times it was terrible. But since we started buying Wiseguys pizza, we have been very happy with the pies we get. Sometimes Dar picks em up, and sometimes they deliver, And we're not easy to find. We live in the woods. But either way the pizza is always great. We love their crust, and it all tastes good the next day or 2.  They are very polite on the phone and in person.  We tell our friends and family all the time how much we love Wiseguys Pizza . We have had them over to taste it too and they agree they are good at pizza.   Most important they aren't over priced. I'd rather tip well than to pay over priced pizza.   Wiseguys  keep up the good job.  We appreciate it."

"1.0","We used to order about six pizzas a month from this place, but are now done with Gennaro's. Last night, we ordered two LARGE (16'/12-cut) one-topping pizzas, but when the pizzas arrived, they were MEDIUM/14' size, with one cut into 10 slices and the other in eight. We checked the receipt to confirmed we were charged for LARGE pizzas and then called to let them know that they sent two mediums. The unapologetic response we got was that they've recently changed sizes and MEDIUM is the new LARGE. (You'd think they might have mentioned that to a regular customer?) So we ended up with the equivalent of 16 slices when we ordered 24. Either somebody screwed up and they lied instead of fixing the problem OR they really are now charging large prices for medium pizzas. So I called the following day and asked to speak to the owner. The man who answered the phone said the owner wasn't available, but identified himself as the manager and confirmed the story. I pointed out to him that the menu on their website still shows that a large pizza is 16'/12-cut and he told me the website hadn't been updated yet.There are lots of places to order pizza from on the South Side and I'm sure I can find another that's more worthy of my business than Gennaro's."
"5.0","Stopped in and had a sushi platter last night - probably my first time in close to ten years at kiku. It was fantastic. Easily much higher quality than Nakama in the Southside."
"4.0","Great outdoor spot. Beer selection is OK, not the Yard House by any stretch of the imagination, and pricey. Mediocre drafts command a princely sum compared to other places. However when all is said it is very fun to hang out here. Bar staff are friendly."
"2.0","Usually decent. Staff is extremely rude on the phone. Don't apologize when a delivery is 30 mins late, or when there is an issue with your order, or when you arrive and the order has not been completed. Older delivery guy has been to my house, and on several occasions he shoves crushed pizza boxes to me while on the phone yelling at someone on the other end. If you live close, avoid the delivery fee and cold, crushed pizza delivered by an angry disgruntled man. Was charged $12.95 for a 6 pack, when the 12 pack was $13.95. I left without noticing. Called, and asked the employee if he really charged me $12.95 for a 6 pack, and he said 'yeah', and I asked is the 12 pack really $13.95, and he said 'yeah'. And then I asked why he didn't tell me that? Came back to the restaurant where the owner confronted me and started yelling that I was 'f*cking yelling' at his employee when I clearly knew the prices and was costing him 50 cents for using my credit card. Well, nothing is clearly labeled, and it's also my prerogative to use a credit card so ... (ps his employee charged me incorrectly for the 12 pack anyways, so the owner got his 50 cents). Due to the hit or miss pizza (30% of the time it's burnt) and being yelled at by the owner when he's trying to swindle local repeat customers, I will no longer be giving them my business."

"3.0","Hey, a Panera is a Panera. I have fond memories of this one just because it's located near Pitt, where I attended college; I would meet a number of friends for dinner here and even interview people for the school paper here. Good times!However, no Panera is perfect. The biggest drawback to this Panera is its location. The service is wonderful and the food is as good as it is at any other Panera, but unfortunately if it's time for the midday/dinner rush nothing will save you from getting lost in the swarm of students and staff members all looking to get a yummy sandwich or bowl of soup. It's always good to have a back-up plan in case the line is really long here - fortunately it's Oakland, so there's no shortage of alternative eateries. Also: if you want parking, try the Panera that's along Boulevard of the Allies; that one has a parking lot, but this one does not.On the plus side, in recent years this Panera's added a LOT of new space to accommodate the population it feeds, which is wonderful; it doesn't do much to help when you're standing in line, but at least once you get your food you have a greater chance of finding a table hidden in the back corner and you can use the wi-fi in relative peace. Still, fair warning: extra space or not, be ready to compete with a massive student population if you want to sit in here.One final note and tip: if you're looking to host a class or meeting here, go for it: this Panera, (like many, it seems) has a nice meeting room that's separate from the main dining area. The one here is almost constantly in use - that's how popular this place is. Everyone likes Panera in Oakland, I guess!"

"5.0","We had our first opportunity to dine at Luke Wholey's last evening ( 10/10/2018). We were with another couple and were both celebrating our anniversary.We were greeted by Tony who then seated us and was our excellent waiter for the evening.The food was exceptional! She crab soup, filet, shrimp, crab cakes were enjoyed by all. There was one hiccup. Three of us ordered Land & Sea. On the menu it stated scallop, shrimp, filet. When served it did not have the scallop but Escovar . When brought to the attention of Tony, he apologized & went to check on this. Quickly, Michael, the general manager rectified this problem by bringing us the above mentioned scallops & his apology, as well. This place will definitely be on our list of go to places!!We are also planning on trying their Happy Hour.We enjoyed talking with Tony and MichaelAll four of us had a very delicious meal and an enjoyable evening!"
"4.0","Since this is just an update I won't bore you with anything other than the highlights.Service: better this time. We were in no way rushed through our meal and enjoyed ourselves for a little over two hours. She was helpful with suggestions and efficient with removing plates from the table. Complimentary white bean hummus with balsamic vinegar and red peppers: Very flavorful as per usual. We were offered seconds but declined to not fill up on bread.Spiced gala apple spread with mascarpone goat cheese honey  and crostini- there were only five small pices and six of us so portion size needs to be considered if you have more than five people. The crostini was WAY too hard and hurt my teeth chewing it. The spiced cinnamon apples were amazingly flavorful and nicely complemented the drizzled honey. The goat cheese was tasty and added a unique profile to enhance the sweet apples.Smoked Gouda(sage wheat-encrusted smoked Gouda , sautéed spinach, sun dried tomatoes, pesto , balsamic reduction)- one of my favorite appetizers ever! Smoky with a hint of nuts and slightly sweet from the sun dried tomatoes. Excellent as always. If you only get one appetizer here get this! Complimentary salad- no dressing choice this time. Beets and pickled onions were nice additions.Crab cakes with zucchini risotto and housemade remoulade- very meaty, little to no filler. Large portion. Zucchini risotto was creamy and prepared perfectly. Roasted Duck breast with cranberry orange reduction and aged broccoli cheddar hash- the duck was so tender! The skin was perfectly crisp! Portion was very large for both the duck and the hash. The cranberry orange reduction was quite unique when paired with the duck and offered a nice, sweet counterbalance for dipping. The broccoli cheddar hash was just homefries with cheddar and steamed broccoli. I'd suggest a different side dish be paired with this as it was just too simplistic with the more evolved flavors from the duck and reduction. It was seasoned well but just seemed out of place.Frenched 16 oz. pork chop with roasted spice pear reduction and smoky blue cheese mashed potatoes- the pork chop was thick yet very tender. The pear reduction was a unique twist on the typical apple/chop combination. The blue cheese mash were tasty but on the runny side. My review stands at 4 stars since I have had the chance to explore more in the US since my last review.  While not getting everything perfect, they get enough right to make this an always solid choice for an evening out."
"5.0","This place has fantastic service and the cured meats are really well done.  They always seem happy to steer you in the right direction if you can't decide.  This is one of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh, for sure."
"4.0","Decided to try this place out after passing by it numerous times. The interior is clean and spacious. There's plenty of seating available as well. They have a limited menu and everything is chicken based, duh. I ordered the Chicken sandwich and wanted to try damn hot, since my spice tolerance is pretty good. The cashier cautioned that medium itself can be quite hot and so I decided to go with hot. My verdict - the hot is what I'd consider medium, but I can imagine why they'd be considered hot for others. The sandwich itself was decent and the chicken crispy, would have preferred a better bun. Overall, it was quick and you get a decent quality chicken sandwich and the price is reasonable too. I however was not a fan of their to-go box for the chicken sandwich. The box is meant for nugget like items. The sandwich is quite large and trying to eat it out of the box wasn't the most convenient."
"3.0","Came here for Valentine's Day.  We were seated so quickly, which was a definite plus for a place that doesn't take reservations.  Service was outstanding.  Wine was delicious.  However, the food just wasn't that good.  My chicken was pretty undercooked (very pink), and the polenta was very soupy.  The pasta in the genovese was cooked just right but the meat was pretty toothy.  I will say the charcuterie was amazing, as was the tiramisu.  Verdict - come here for wine, charcuterie and dessert, skip the meal."
"4.0","I think I need to mention off the bat that the menu here is small. Guys, that's a good thing. Seriously, restaurants with overwhelming menus just cause confusion and longer waits at times. When there's a concentrated menu food seems to be more fresh and on point.There are taco specials that change and that's a nice little surprise when you're in the mood for something different.The interior is small and not good for large groups. I've eaten here once and other times just order takeaway.$3 tacos can't be beat! Definitely in my top ten for local tacos."
"5.0","Amazing pizza! And super fast delivery on a Sunday night. We got half meatball and half pepperoni. The meatballs were delicious."
"5.0","Stopped by here with a buddy after work on a Sunday. You can find street parking nearby or a pay lot just down the road. They don't open until 5 and we got there right as they opened. It's on the smaller side and filled up fairly quick. It seems to be a real hotspot on Mount Washington. There is a reason for that.  I was told that I needed to try a cocktail despite being a craft beer guy. Speaking of, they had a great selection of crafts. But I digress, I was told to order a cocktail before anything else. I went with a go to, an Old Fashioned.  The gentleman behind the bar went to work and it was almost hypnotic watching him make the drink. It was like watching an artist working with his medium of choice. It took him a few minutes to assemble and put some finishing touches on it but was totally worth the wait. After tasting the drink I can honestly say I don't think I've ever had a true Old Fashioned until that very moment!  It was amazing and eye opening! The attention to detail in making the drink really came through. And that is what is great about the Summit! They truly put effort into the establishment. I for one will be making this a regular stop and strongly encourage others to stop by."
"5.0","Great food, bar, and location. Will be back. Arugula salad and parmesan risotto were delicious. The staff is very knowledgeable about the food."
"5.0","Good lunch choice!  The $10 best friend combo is a great deal.  You get your choice of arepa, empanada, and drink.  I had the shredded beef arepa that had plantains on it and it was delicious and fresh!  I also chose the shredded chicken empanada, which had great flavor.  There were 2 homemade drink options (you can also choose from bottled drinks) - homemade iced tea lemonade and coffee lemonade.  The first one was sweet and refreshing.  You also get to choose from a number of sauces.  I did the garlic and the spicy avocado, the latter was not spicy.  It's a small restaurant (2 indoor and 4 outdoor tables), so get there early!"
"5.0","My husband and I chose to visit Capital Grille while in town for work. We made a reservation, not knowing how busy they could/would be. We ordered the bone-in ribeye, med-rare, a side of sauteed wild mushrooms and the augratin potatoes. The steak came out perfect! It was exactly how we ordered and tasted fabulous. It was not over-seasoned, and was extremely tender. The mushrooms and potatoes were large portions and also quite delicious. The restaurant/restrooms are clean and the service was on point."
"4.0","The long narrow staircase, vibrant wallpaper, neon signs, and intimate third floor space make Umami feel unlike any other restaurant in Pittsburgh. We arrived right at our reservation time and were seated immediately. Since this was our first time at Umami, our excellent server, Elizabeth, explained the izakaya style in which the food is served. The food is prepared pretty quickly, so you place multiple orders rather than ordering everything at once. Elizabeth and others checked on us frequently to ask if we needed anything.The menu obviously sets Umami apart as well. My table ordered skewers (chicken thigh, pork belly, chicken heart, and chicken skin), hand rolls (yellowtail and mackerel), ramen, and yatai (fried chicken, octopus balls, and eggplant with ground chicken). Everything was delicious except for the ramen, which we all agreed lacked flavor, even with the chili sauce. Next time I'll just stick with the yatai dishes, which were small plates of fried Japanese-style street food.There's a lot of great options to try at Umami, so my advice would be to bypass the ramen and sushi, which you get elsewhere, and stick with the unique and memorable flavors of the fried street foods!"
"4.0","Pamela's diner is a great place for a quick brunch. Food is pretty heavy, but you won't need to eat anything else until dinner time. Also, it's very cheap. You might need to wait for a bit."
"5.0","I was really shocked I liked this place and even more that I loved it. We got together with some family for Easter pre-game and I was not happy we were trying this place but decided to try and make the most of it. And then a while later I was stripped of my socks when my meal arrived. I got the carb cakes and cheddar broccoli risotto and oh wow. The crab cakes were all lump crab deliciousness. The risotto was chessy yumminess. Even the salad was fantastic. It has beets in which my not appeal to some but I loved. The BF got the seared tuna, which is not for me but he thoroughly enjoyed. Two people got the sausage pasta and that was amazing. The pasta was clearly homemade, a lost art in my opinion, and the sausage was quoted as 'the best I've ever had' by one of the woman who ordered it. We didn't get desert because of the amount of Easter candy littering the table but I can only imagine how I would haw the tuxedo cake. The place is small and very quaint, with lots of interesting furniture, and our waitress was so nice and accommodating. I love the atmosphere which is the the din of forks on plates and some lite jazz or something playing in the background. No loud music and college students acting like fools. I cannot express how much I enjoyed this meal. I would highly encourage you to try it as well."
"5.0","I go past this place everyday on the way to work.Always wanted to stop, Glad I did!! Awesome breakfast wraps and reasonable prices. Will definitely stop again, and again, and again!!!"
"5.0","Awesome. This restaurant is just awesome. Awesome food, awesome service, everything! I love coming here before seeing a show and for special occasions! I look forward to the vast wine selections and great steak!"
"1.0","If you have small children or are a person of color, this is not the restaurant for you. Immediately upon entering with our small children we were told that if we didn't have a reservation we could not be seated. We noticed many empty tables and when we asked the bartender, they confirmed that there were no reservations and tables were open - we had already ordered to go. While we waited for our food an African American man walked in and asked to have a cappachino at the bar - he was told by the host they only do that to go, however, once again, the bartender confirmed he could sit and have his coffee (of course the host, who was very selective about who ate at his restaurant was unaware). Racist, unfriendly, and NOT for families."
"3.0","Solid option for brunch. I've been here a couple times on the weekend and it gets packed during peak brunch/lunch hours. Food/pricing is fair for the strip district and our meals have always been delicious. There definitely room for improvement on the overall flow/organization. Food comes out decently fast once seated, but it takes forever to order at the front counter. There's also some disorganization to the table number process and lack of communication between upstairs/downstairs waitstaff, which is very confusing as the customer. My biggest gripe is the coffee situation. You get an empty mug that you fill yourself at the coffee station, but then you have to carry a hot cup of coffee all the way to your table upstairs. I just don't see how this is safe at all, especially when you're trying to juggle your kid. Maybe I'm being overly cautious but I think it's a huge safety issue and could be a huge problem if someone were to spill/burn themselves or worse, a child! One suggestion is to eliminate the coffee at the coffee stations and simply have insulated coffee pots brought to the table by your waitress and left there so they don't have to go around filling coffees."
"4.0","When we first walked in, we couldn't help but admire how trendy the restaurant was. Umami is a bit tucked away as the entrance is to the left of Round Corner Cantina and you have to walk up two flights of stairs. I do recommend getting a reservation beforehand since the restaurant isn't huge. It was really neat seeing the open kitchen and how they prepare the food. My friend and I each ordered the pork belly robatayaki skewer. The chunks of pork were large, tender, slightly charred, but lacking some flavor. Next we shared the takoyaki. There were six takoyaki balls with shaved katsuobushi on top. The takoyaki had good flavor but lacked an outer crispy skin. The kewpie sauce was generously available on the plate so you could dip as much sauce as you wanted. I ordered the zaru soba. It comes with a skewer of grilled salmon, which was excellently made as the salmon meat was exceptionally tender and fell off the skewer as I tried to eat it. The soba noodle sauce is more tart than traditionally sauces I've had since it's made with ponzu sauce. I found the tartness equally, if not more, delicious. My friend ordered the tonkotsu ramen. I only tried a bite, but the broth seemed very rich and authentic. Service overall was excellent."
"2.0","I normally love this place and go to the Western Ave normally. I happened to stop in this location on Saturday night at 730 and had the worst service. The man cooking was either too high or drunk to understand the order and didn't seem too happy about cooking yet another order. We waited an exceptionally long time for just two sandwiches and at this point were the only ones in the place. We finally get our orders and one of them were wrong and the other had so much mayo on it it was a sopping mess. I will never come back to this location again. Guys at Western Ave have their act together . This guy was the worst ."
"5.0","Beta Bites adds Moroccan style spices to many of their dishes, providing for a unique twist on the typical French fries, sandwiches and wings of a collegetown joint. Open quite late on weekends, nothing beats a chicken sharmola sandwich with fries after a night out. Ask about their loyalty card."
"4.0","I am glad that we made a reservation during lunch for Restaurant Week, because it certainly seemed very busy when we walked in. Most likely they were catering to the usual customer base of downtown employees in addition to those like us. The interior itself felt like a museum with all the paintings on the walls and the stuffed animal heads (the latter was probably not necessary). One annoying thing was the slow speed at which we were attended to--we had to wait quite a bit before getting our waters, before getting our orders taken, the bread coming out, and then finally each of the fixed courses. The bread and clam chowder first course were fine--pretty tasty, nothing to write home about. The second course got interesting. We each ordered a dry aged sirloin, which came with a good salad on the side. The steak was actually done wonderfully, super tender and finely spiced around. But the problem was that both of ours came out rare when we ordered medium-rare! Even our waiter acknowledged this, although by the time he came back around we waited so long that we were pretty much finished with our meal. It wasn't the biggest problem in the world, but our waiter acknowledged the mixup and compensated our meal. So that was nice, and the desserts were good too. So while I probably wouldn't go back on a normal occasion, it sure was an interesting experience."
"3.0","Wife and I went to Luke Wholey's the other night for dinner.We saw all the great reviews and decided to give it a shot.The place is pretty big in size and was mobbed.We were seated immediately which was a good sign.Waiter brought over water and menus immediately and then came back for drink orders.I had the broiled cod with french fries and a french onion soup.The soup was pretty good, but my complaint with it was that it was almost all cheese and very little soup????.The cod was ok nothing to write home about.The service was excellent and the waiter was very friendly.The service was a bit slow, but that was properly do to it being mobbed.I would properly go again if it was less crowded and I would try something else."
"1.0","Bad service and neglect from kitchen. Three out of four of us had incorrect food brought to us, incomplete menu items inconsistent to what the menu says. Waiter told us they didn't have the items to complete the food ordered and laughed and shrugged his shoulders. Upon receiving checks a mouse ran underneath the table. Do not recommend."
"5.0","To me, this is the best restaurant in Pittsburgh. Not the best Japanese or Asian place, but the hands-down best. The sushi is sublime. From your basic tuna rolls to your fancier hand rolls and specialties, I've not had anything I didn't want more of. The second-best sushi I've ever had. However, what makes this place shine is how good everything ELSE tastes! Too often, people thing Japanese = sushi. From the simple miso soup and house salad (which were far above others I've had) to the various platters, each dish tastes like a delicacy. The steak and chicken teriyaki are delicious choices that satisfy the more timid palate, and the various hot dishes that arrive on platters are all also excellent. Even the desserts, though simple, are excellent. I recommend the anjou pear poached in plum wine. The downsides of this place are parking ($), price ($$$), and interior. Being in Station Square, you'll likely have to pay to park. The portions are not large for the money, which means you'll spend even more to be full. I expect to spend upwards of $70 for two when I come here. Also, the inside is plain and somewhat dated, which doesn't attract me. However, the incredible preparation and taste of the food here have kept me coming back any time I can afford a fancy meal!"
"5.0","Make sure to order the hot cakes when you visit Pamela's! Get ready for deliciously soft crepes, with nice crunchy edges - really adds texture and flavor. I went with the banana and chocolate chip crepes.Delicious!"
"1.0","Two things I asked for when I ordered tacos here: CORN SHELL and JUST CHEESE- no sour cream. The girl taking my order understood but the guy making my order completely disregarded her notes. I got a sour cream-drenched mess in a flour tortilla. Not worth the wait or the price- never again!!!"
"4.0","Currently going through all of my favorite delivery sports, to show some love! Beta Bites is great for pizza alternatives. I actually have not had the pizza because I've been too happy with the chicken plate. Rice, a boat-load of perfectly seasoned chicken, and salada! I adore it! Plus, they give you a side of tahini to tie it all together! It's definitely two meals worth and definitely satisfying!"
"5.0","Sit out on the patio! Lovely ambiance inside and out, but the floating umbrellas on the patio are sweet. Good coffee, a varied menu, hard to choose. I had the French toast with Brie, apple and fig compote which was a mix of savory and sweet. The Nutella hot chocolate was fabulous, but too rich to drink a whole mug!"
"5.0","Stopped here for an early dinner on a weeknight. I made reservations just in case. The place is small and would fill up easily. Anyway,  the food is excellent. Stop reading this and go already!"
"3.0","Ok Chinese food. Delivery was fast to our hotel but messed up on a few items or else they would of gotten a 4. Better Chinese food in Toronto for sure"
"5.0","Went here with a friend last week. I could not stop talking about how amazing my meal was for days later. I ordered the Chiang Mai Mee with chicken. I'm a sizeable guy, so it didn't quite fill me up, but I took the leftover curry sauce home and there was enough for a good two more bowls of rice. We also split an appetizer platter. The peanut sauce was amazing. Seriously, this was possibly the best meal I've had in Pittsburgh. For the price, the quality and amount of food was an incredible value. The staff were quiet, but friendly. Food was served in a very timely fashion. Seriously, I would return here over Smiling Banana Leaf or Pusadee's Garden any day."
"5.0","If you have more than 2 or 3 people, you definitely want to make a reservation in advance. Usually it's only me and a friend so we can get away with sitting at the bar and ordering drinks and dinner :) My favorite go to's would include: the pork and shrimp shumai, the whole squid and any of their sakes. Next on my list to try are the noodle soups - especially the ramens! Definitely check Umami out!"
"3.0","All aspects of the restaurant's service were way below my expectation for a restaurant of this caliber, with the exception of the valet.The hostesses seemed disoriented and confused when I arrived and pointed to the table where the rest of my party had been seated rather than escorting me. Our waitress would be a better fit at McDonald's than a high end establishment, she referred to me as 'Hun' several times. She never asked if we wanted another bottle of wine. Her assistants were also inattentive to our needs (we requested water 3 times before our glasses were filled). The highlight of my experience was my meal."
"5.0","Great fresh seafood in Pittsburgh! It was quite good. Lots of options. Really great fresh tuna in the sushi. I got the Baja shrimp volcano as it seems to be popular and it really made me want a bowl of the lobster bisque it's filled with. Mashed potato volcano was sooo good and I enjoyed the shrimp and lobster claw. Their food is well presented. Next time I will get the oysters!"
"1.0","Ordered a spicy shrimp biryani and it turned out to be rice overcooked in chilly powder and salt water with shrimps.  Paid over 14 dollars and was not worth it at all.  The Shrimps in the biryani were fresh and that's the only plus point."
"4.0","Another great visit to Cafe Raymond. I ordered the same egg dish as last time while my dad got an omelet (which he loved, large quantity and good quality!) and mom got the sweet potato toast. It seemed like potato that had been sweetened rather than sweet potato. She didn't think it was anything special, but the omelet and eggs breakfast still didn't disappoint!"
"5.0","Great beer, good burgers, excellent fries. Who'da thunk you could get cheap beer in Lawrenceville?"
"5.0","I wish that I would have known about this place sooner.  I have only been here twice since I only discovered it last month.  I had the turkey burger with fries and a chocolate malt the first time and I had the Frisco with onion rings and soda the second time.  I love this place!  Everything I ate from here was golden.  I can now say that I'm a Hardee's fan."
"2.0","The service was so bad  i almost walked out. Two young girls were on a computer didn't say hi just stood there at the counter and waited for us to order. They had a miserable demeanor and kept saying to one another 'i can't wait to leave ' this is annoying to me as a customer and not professional. I will not go back if the two miserable girls are working. Food was good. They need to hire less whiney unappreciative people."
"5.0","I love their pizza! Can be a little pricey but I have yet to be disappointed! Their garlic butter sauce is to die for"
"5.0","Good quality, great value, in a comfortable laid-back environment. A must for lunch!Tell Gisele I sent you in for the walk-in special."
"3.0","Ordered the grilled cheese with crab - at least that is what I think I ordered, its not anywhere on their website menu. It had been good, but did not taste strongly of crab (which is why I now question it) and it had been very rich and heavy, with almost too much butter or oil or whatever it had been cooked in.The buffalo chicken rillettes were better, it was a buffalo chicken dip essentially, with bread and blue cheese. It packed a lot of punch in the small container it was served in.It was busy that night but the service was attentive, and while I dont drink beer, their selection seemed to be very wide and pleasing to all palates."
"5.0","This was a great find on Liberty.  We recently had lunch here and were incredibly impressed with the quality of the food.  I definitely recommend trying Sausalido for lunch considering the menu's are almost identical except lunch is cheaper.   Our experience started with warm bread that came out with a bean puree that was dressed with multiple layers of incredible flavors and could easily stand alone as its own appetizer but it was complementary with the bread!  I think that the bean dip was only a foreshadowing of the extreme attention to detail that the chef and owner shows when developing menu items.    I had the zucchini bisque and wild mushroom flatbread both of which were perfect and my wife had the pumpkin ravioli that was incredibly accentuated by cinnamon sprinkle julienned apples.  Both of our meals were incredible.  Additionally the pumpkin ravioli was a seasonal replacement for the standard ravioli.  The waiter was OK (not bad but not great) but the owner/manager came around and spoke with everyone and definitely reinforced our opinion that this places really cares about the quality it puts out!    I can't wait to go back and try the new seasonal additions to the menu!"
"4.0","Great little place in Bloomfield. The food was wonderful and the portions were enormous. All entrees come with a side salad (have the house dressing) and bread with a white bean dip. I ordered the pork chops and my partner ordered the crab cakes - we both loved our food and took half our meals home to save room for the peanut butter and jam creme brûlée and flamed bananas - so good! Service was a little slow, but that is my only complaint.Oh, it's byob and the corkage fee is only 2 bucks! Wonderful for a date night."
"5.0","Fantastic! Authentic, succulent food, delightful atmosphere and staff are a realpleasure. It's a small space, quaint and charming, you sit at the counter and watch the chef prepare the food, and they also do a robust takeout business. My teenage daughter and I shared three tacos, but should have followed the owner's recommendation that we get two each. The carnitas were perfection, the other two tacos - outstanding. Very affordable, great place to have lunch in the South Side!"
"5.0","This was the bright spot during my day of jury duty. I had arepas in NYC a few years ago, but I bet most Pittsburghers have no idea what they are. This is a great lunch for about $10. I had the Best Friends lunch special with a can of pop, which was $10.88 or $0.18 more than I earned for sitting on my rear all day for jury duty. The shredded beef empanada was warm- spicy, not too hot for my midwestern palate. They have a small seating area and it was perfect for watching the traffic go by, except for one aspect: I smelled a bit like the fryer for the rest of the afternoon, so if you are headed back to the office you may want to get takeout. Don't forget the sauces, I had to choose only one, but they have a lot of options. You may ask: What do they go on? I have no idea - they went with both my arepa and empanada and no one judged me."
"3.0","i ordered the chicken sandwich combo meal which added a side and a drink. i chose the fries for my side which were crinkle cut and had light old bay seasoning. the friends were ok, not amazing. the sandwich was also just ok. i did like that the sandwich had coleslaw on it but the bread was a bit too heavy. the sandwich also dripped a lot which was a mixture from the coleslaw and the oil from the chicken. i ordered mild and should have ordered medium. the chicken was a bit salty but the size of the sandwich was pretty big. the portion of the order was good and worth the price but the overall flavor was lacking, more salty than flavorful.the interior of the place was cute with plants displayed on the wall. the music was pretty loud in the restaurant but the vibe overall was nice. they have a lot of seating inside, tables with bench seating against the wall and then a couple raised long tables with stools in the middle and more seating on the second floor."
"5.0","The burgers here are delicious and well worth the price!! We got the Shadyside burger and the Fox chapel burgers and they were both tasty. The Fox chapel burger was less heavy than the Shadyside burger and when paired with the salad, it didn't put me in the post-thanksgiving-meal comma as burgers usually do. Great place overall."
"2.0","This was a disappointment. My boyfriend and I came here one night after I had a particularly long day at work and just wanted something quick. (I suggested it since I've had really great experiences at their downtown location). There were three people working and about 6 people in front of us. They burnt almost everyone's pizza. The pizza is cooked on a conveyor belt and they left trays on there so everyone's pizza got stuck in the machine. After discovering the first 2 pizzas were burnt they proceeded to leave those ones on the belt while remaking them, which then in turn caused our pizzas to be stuck in the machine and get burnt. My pizza wasn't so burnt so they didn't remake it but my boyfriend's was destroyed. Out of anger he just took it because he was hungry and didn't want to wait. Since mine was stuck in there for longer than it should've it was a bit hard to eat and his was nearly inedible. The one shining grace was the obviously new employee felt so bad she remade my boyfriend's pizza and brought it over to us as an apology (I give this girl a lot of credit, especially since the shift manager should've done something). They were incredibly disorganized and uncommunicative with each other. Would hate to see it when it's actually busy."
"2.0","I ordered a medium burger and it was probably the driest piece of meat I have eaten in a long time! I was so disappointed I had to order aioli to attempt to help get it down. Ugh. The fries were decent, but way too much cheese sauce for me."
"1.0","Absolutely one of the worst experiences I have had at a pizza place. Used GrubHub to place an order through them and then they denied even receiving it and we're fighting grubhub on it. Avoid this place at all cost!! Do NOT I repeat Do NOT order from this place or give it any business."
"4.0","Very cool interior and all staff we encountered were exceptionally friendly and knowledgeable about their food and wine offerings. Even offered some advice to us as tourists. We started with a sensational charcuterie platter with extensive choice of flavours. It was a great way to start and we followed up with a beautiful risotto. The suggested wine pairings worked well. Will definitely be back."
"4.0","A small quaint building with a bar type atmosphere but no alcohol. You sit and watch them prepare your meal before your eyes. They have 6 options of tacos with a variation of toppings depending on your selection. They do have a vegan and vegetarian option taco. A bit pricey for tacos but very tasty and worth every penny."
"4.0","Great place. Very high price/quality and quantity ratio. There are better/fancier places but if you want a decently=priced dinner, this is your place. My favorite dish is the thai fish cakes: they are an appetizer but are very filling. Papaya salad good too. And the pumpkin curry. I find their noodle dishes are not their best, nor is the sweet and sour dishes."
"2.0","Extremely overpriced for what you get. Sushi at Krogers is better.  I got the three rivers and I never had worse sushi. Dang really disappointed. Bloody Mary was so,so."
"4.0","HOT CAKES.  That's really all I have to say.  I was wondering what the fuss was about, and when I took my first bite, it all made sense.  As for the rest of the breakfast items, they're okay.  I ordered corned beef hash, and it seemed like the kind of corned beef that came from a can.  I could be wrong, but it just didn't have much flavor.  The only annoying thing about this place is the wait.  Get there early or be prepared to wait, outside, for a long while."
"5.0","I'm really not sure where to start on this review because everything was absolutely phenomenal. I could not have asked for a better server or better food which if you knew me says a lot considering my older brother is a professional chef who has won several championships in the state of Maryland and I've been a bit spoiled by his cooking. Let's get started. The date was Saturday February 18th - we brought some sunny beautiful 60-65 degree weather to Pittsburgh  My aunt made reservations for us since it would be a larger party at 6pm. It was my aunt and uncle, my favorite cousin's girlfriend and her mom, husband and I and our two kids. When we arrived, we were seated immediately. Our server Brian came over right away and got our drink order. He was fabulous! First off, our son is autistic and he was absolutely amazing with him. He could've very easily blown my son off while we were there and not answered our son's 50-60 questions about what type of cellphone do you have and why you should have an iPhone like his parents do. We all decided that we would share some appetizers. We ordered calamari, Thai chili catfish bites, wild Alaskan roll off of the sushi menu and I also got an order of seaweed salad for myself. My family all ordered the fish and chips, the crab stuffed salmon, the imperial swordfish, the Alaskan crab legs, my aunt ordered the Baja shrimp puttanesca pasta, the Baja shrimp and Day boat scallops, the colossal blue crab salad and it was absolutely amazing - all of it. Luke came out and checked on us. He was genuine, he talked to both of the kids, our daughter told him how her and our son caught a huge rockfish off the pier back home and showed him the picture(he thought it was awesome), Luke thanked us for coming in and told us to call him at the restaurant next time we were in town. I know this is long, my insincere apologies lol but this place is so worth it! So if y'all have"
"2.0","Pizza brand pizza. This pizza tastes like pizza. What sets a pizza spot like this apart from its competitors is neighborhood and price. Rialto is 4 minutes away from some of the best pizza in town and the prices are not the lowest nor the highest. I've called in multiple times to ask what the specials were. I don't get any specials, and then there is a special on the sign out front similar and cheaper than what I ordered. I think it is typically worth driving the extra 4 minutes for the better pizza or the cheaper pizza."
"5.0","Tried this place for the first time, and loved everything about it! This place is pretty small so you may want or have to get your tacos to go, but it's absolutely worth it! I ordered the chicken and carnitas tacos and paid only $6. The menu is super simple which I like, because it makes the decision process much easier. Plus, I'd rather eat at a place that offers few, but high quality items as opposed to a plethora of mediocre items. The fresh ingredients are right there behind the counter as you can watch your meal being prepared. Personally, I found the chicken to have to more flavor so next time I'll go with that. I saw someone else's order of loaded nachos and for about five bucks, they looked hearty and tasty. I'll definitely bring friends back to this place for more good eats. Also, they have vegan and vegetarian options available.!"
"3.0","Not my first choice for late night pizza slices in downtown Pittsburgh. The Cafe was empty at 10 pm  on a Saturday night and they offered pizza by the slice. It was close to the hotel I was staying for the night and reason for the visit. Expensive slice my I add. $12 for three slices. I am not a coke person so I did not purchase a drink. I don't think I would ever return nor recommend. The pizza was ok, nothing exciting, nothing special about it."
"5.0","So good!! Who would have thought I would be able to dine Venezuelan street food in a downtown Pittsburgh alley! Fresh made food and fast service! The girl at the counter was very helpful and answered all of our questions."
"2.0","This is not a place I would recommend....table for two in virtually an empty restaurant....speaking of that table it was one of those that wobbled, there was another table very close to us and with us pretty much being the only ones in there, we just shifted over....the decor is avg to not that nice, nothing special......just a boring not so fun place to be....the sushi was ok, but too expensive for this type of place....for nigiri pieces, your typical rolls and special rolls it was over priced....the lady that served us was very nice though and did a pretty good job, this was a pretty forgetable time here...I guess if youre in station square and want sushi quick, pop in here to get your fix, but it's not a place I'd go to when choosing where to dine for the night...."
"4.0","With it's clean style and quality tea, qualiTea if you will, Arnold's Tea is helping to bring some much needed class to the North Side. But my question is, who is Arnold and why did he want to show Pittsburgh that he could build a tea house? Did he actually like tea that well? Did he decide that other people liked tea that well? Was it some experiment to see how well he could excel in a venture like this? It seems like it will always be a mystery to me. He wasn't even there when I was there. It was just two ladies working. Which brings me to some new questions. Who were they and why were they so dedicated to making me my rooibos iced tea?  I will never know the answers to Arnold's secrets. What I Do know is that he created a very nice environment in which to relax or work while enjoying the tea he is offering. Also he created a very nice selection of tea to enjoy while sitting on a massive leather couch in his wood-laden parlor. I see a bright future for the North Side and it looks a lot like Arnold's Tea."
"4.0","My husband and I tried out Sausalido as we were searching for a rehearsal dinner spot, and it was solid. Not a terribly interesting menu, but the owner and service were friendly, the food seemed predictably good, and the value was good as well. On the other hand, the interior is slightly dated and our window table in the window was so cold that I had to keep my jacket on.We started our meal with the roasted sprouts - which didn't really taste roasted (outsides weren't caramelized) - but were covered in cheese, so were still pretty good. We had the pork and the steak for our entrees, and while they weren't notably amazing, they were cooked and seasoned well...and the portions were enormous. I'm not sure if we would make Sausalido a destination, but I would eat here again if I'm in the neighborhood and want a nicer meal."
"5.0","Stopped in this east-side gem for some brunch while I waited for my dentist appt. Ordered the triple meat breakfast sandwich and it exceeded my expectations. The place has a cozy casual vibe, where I was able to briefly work on my laptop with their free wifi with minimal interruptions. The food and service was enough to know I should stop in again whenever I'm in the east-side area."
"5.0","Best pastrami sandwich I ever had, and I have been to NY delis. Bread was divine! Stone ground mustard and mango Jarritos."
"4.0","Quality spot in south sideCheap, quick, and a good eat...usually get the loaded nachos Fun drunk meal as well"
"2.0","Let me start out by saying that I love me some Panera. Usually, I get my soup and salad or even some soup and a sandwich and I am on my way. There new broth soups are awful. Seriously. It was flavorless and gross. I was not amused. Especially since it was so expensive. I will go out and update my review. But for now, it has two stars."
"5.0","My partner and I love Cinderlands. It's our favorite date spot. Every single time we go there without fail we have a great time. Amazing food, great beer, and incredibly affordable. Will always go back!"
"1.0","Not happy with my experience.  It took 1 hour 45 min for my food to be delivered.  when it said 45 min - 1 hour.  Also when i got my food it was not warm at all by that point.  I ORDERED a personal pizza came with 3 wings and a drink, and cheesy bread.  Pizza was ok but cold, and they gave me the wrong drink, and i got mozzarella sticks instead of cheesy bread.  I would order here again."
"1.0","Me and my family placed an order that had two steak salads in it. When they started to eat said 'steak' salads to find gyro meat instead of steak and when we called they refused to give us our money back and would not send us new salads with steak in them!"
"5.0","There's no place like Salems! I recently left Pittsburgh and I miss this place terribly! They have the best burgers, steak, gyro and chilli chicken just to name a few. The meat market next door makes it very convenient for one stop shopping! Friendly staff, great food and chill atmosphere are some of the most important qualities for me and these guys got it all! Definitely a place to visit more than once a week."
"4.0","I couldn't find the restaurant at first because there's no clear sign outside - but mama didn't raise a quitter so I channeled my inner Sherlock and found the stairs leading to Umami. The menu is Japanese street food inspired - we had a bunch of robatayaki (yakitori style skewers of grilled fare), a grilled whole branzino, and the sashimi plate. The highlights were the pork belly skewer and the branzino, but the sashimi was also super fresh and the scottish salmon skewer was also delicious!! We had to back for round two on the port belly skewers because DAMN they are YUMami. Downside was we got dripped on by the vents above us but I can look past that for a tasty meal!"
"1.0","Do not go unless wearing a suit...was ignored while sitting at the bar (my suit jacket was off)...as people filled in around me they were offered water and menus...I waited 15 minutes and was offered neither...total disappointment as there's so many other great places I can pay $15 for a martini for..."
"5.0","Delicious food and friendly staff! Eating in or taking out are great options, and delivery is always fast and accurate. The combination of more traditional Moroccan flavors and quick American favorites is awesome! The amount of food for the price is great for students and anyone on a budget."
"4.0","Attention upper Lawrencevillians with a penchant for the quaint, a new shopping opportunity with unexpectedly high quality options is all up in your block.  Remember how you used to ask the Shop N Save if they had any Gorgonzola or frizzante only to be shunned like the shameless foodie you deserve to be?  We'll now you got a market on 52nd street called the 52nd street market that has all your recycled paper products organic laundry detergent and fair trade chocolate coveted espresso beans right next door.  You don't even need a bike or the 54a to take you over hill to Whole Foods, no sweat!  They have very limited inventory right now, prices are reasonable.  Very local, meats are from Butcher on Butler, pretzels from Axels, and breads from Allegro Hearth."
"4.0","We both got the chicken sandwich, one at mild and one at damn hot (there are 5 different spice levels). The damn hot one was not too enjoyable because of the spice so always start low at a new place! The sandwiches were REALLY tasteful and filling for sure though! Mild was a good tiny bit of spice/salt. A bit slow because it got really busy at 5 pm even on a holiday! Open everyday!!"
"2.0","I must update my review from two years ago. I no longer feel impressed by the taste of their food. I used to love their pierogie pizza, but now I no longer feel satisfied and do not want to finish eating the pizza. The price was sort of high also. My husband's chicken parmesan was very soggy, and he called it 'gross'. We had called ahead to pick up our order. We had to wait well over the 15 minutes that they had told us. When we showed up at the cash register, the employees ignored us for several minutes and did not even say hello."
"5.0","The sushi at Kiku is very fresh and the staff is very friendly. We got the shadyside roll, spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, assorted nigiri, beef tataki and the shrimp shrimp and vegetables. Pricey but worth it."
"5.0","My favorite taco stop.   Flower or corn tacos,  nachos and a veggie bowl.  That's it!   Yummy!"
"2.0","This place seems favored by many people because of its fresh and healthy food. But I really has no feeling for it... The salads have nothing special; the amount of the Phipps Special I ordered is just as much as appetizer in other cafe or so, and taste really bad...(I can't remember the name); the fruit cup is very small and thus pricy. I expected there will be juice in this healthy place, but nope..they gave me soda...the only thing seems ok is the pizza my friend order...Well"
"4.0","Short version: Arepittas is a terrific addition to the downtown lunch spot rotation -- fast, friendly service; delicious & unique menu; great value. Highly recommended.Longer version: The only reasons I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars are for the strictly bare-bones interior (no seating, some standing room), and for the diesel trucks idling just outside on Cherry Way (making the sidewalk tables unusable). They do a brisk take-out lunch business, but I can't imagine that five or ten minutes inside a paper bag improves anything on the menu. Otherwise this place is a winner in every way. I had the 'Best Friend Combo' (one shredded beef empanada & one arepa pernil, washed down with a lime Jarritos), and walked away fully satisfied for under $11. The empanada was nothing like the ones we bake at home (so I'm spoiled); its deep-fried flavor and spongy texture reminded me of carnival food, but in a good way. If they sold these at Kennywood, I'd rank them right up there with Potato Patch fries. But for midweek lunch, it was a little heavier & greasier than I expected, and I'll steer clear the next time. YMMV.The stuffed arepa pernil, on the other hand, was sublime in every way. Tender, juicy pork topped with fresh pico de gallo inside a hot toasted arepa 'bun' -- a traditional Venezuelan bread that's like a cornmeal biscuit crossed with an English muffin, split open like a pita, and a perfect texture for holding all the fillings together. Topped with the house-made salsa picante, it's perfection -- and there are 11 other varieties on the menu that sound just as good. I'm already looking forward to repeat visits, so I can work my way through the arepa line-up and discover some new favorites. Buena suerte, Arepittas!"
"5.0","I really enjoy Cinderlands. The menu is different but delicious! I got the grilled cheese with salt and vinegar fries but they also have the option to get tomato soup with it. I was amazing! They also have great beer! I typically just get their IPAs which they have a variety to choose from!"
"4.0","Outstanding breakfast, just awesome! Their Owner/Chef is internationally trained and the dishes are unique. Sadly, I'm off red meat because his brisket hash topped with two fried eggs looked amazing. I asked for a green pepper, onion and cheddar cheese. I got green, red and yellow pepper, onion and cheddar cheese. Service was awesome, was asked by 3 different servers if we enjoyed our meals. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"
"2.0","I'm not new to the slightly higher price point, chain steak house circuit.  If Ruth's Chris had a rewards program, my family would have free steak for life.  That being said, I know what is expected here.  It's going to be stuffy and overpriced; you know that.  But your expectation is the food and service should make up for those little trips.+1 and I are early 20s, cute lil' professional guys.  I understand we are a contrast to the older people in floor length furs, but we didn't come in off the street like a bunch of ruffians demanding cheese fries (although the ladies behind the host podium would have disagreed).  After being greeted with 'do you have a reservation', we let them know we were early and would have a drink at the bar until our scheduled time was up.  Drinks were fine. Whatever.We were taken to our table which was one of two placed right in front of the kitchen and that terrifying eagle.  They're kind of like the next to the bathroom booths.  When I asked our hostess if we could move to one of the few (3+) open tables that were actually in the dining room, she said she couldn't do that (I would normally freak out over this, but somehow that pales to the rest of the night).  Our waiters and helpers/runners were awesome.  They weren't nearly as personable as you'd expect, but they didn't act like we were confused and didn't mean to be there.Now here, judging by the other reviews, I should rave about the food.  That is absolutely not going to happen.  This is also going to be much more harsh than it should be as I was expecting (what I suppose is) way too much.  Way harsh, T. Oops.Because I don't do seafood, we ordered the fries 'to share' .. The portion you receive of the truffle fries is sad.  If Burgatory's truffle fries are a 10, these may get a 4.  We both ordered our double priced Caesar salads and were given small plates of yellow iceberg.  I can't tell you how sad this was.  A few shavings of asiago I was able to find saved my sanity that night. For our main courses, I ordered the chicken that makes more an hour than I do, and +1 got the strip steak.  He said it was 'good,' but was not impressed in the slightest.  My chicken tasted like I did nothing but threw a chicken in the oven and then cut it in half and served it to you with some blackened cooked shriveling yellow carrots.  It was sad.  So sad we didn't even get dessert.  I just wanted to get out of there.  The only decent sustenance I received was 200% marked up glass of Riesling.If you are thinking of going here, it won't be the worst.  Clearly, people enjoy it.  But if you are one of those people that may have expectations for anything ever or don't happen to have some extra change from your hedge fund to waste, keep walking until you hit Ruth's Chris or something that isn't going to make you cry into your fifty dollar piece of meat (at least that would season it)."
"4.0","I have been to this Panera Bread location several times in the past. I have always enjoyed experience at this location. During my most recent visit I had a minor issues that was wonderfully resolved by the staff members. I am a Panera rewards member. I ordered through the app. There was a minor issue fulfilling the order with my rewards through the app. The staff members hastily mitigated the issue. The best part, is that this process did not take any longer than a normal mobile completion time."
"5.0","This is my first time trying this restaurant out and I must say I was delighted by the service, taste of the food, and friendliness of the staff. The meat was cooked to perfection and the bun was very soft and delicious. My servers name was Sadie and she did a terrific job, she was fairly busy but made my table feel like the only one in the building. Will most definitely recommend this place to all my friends and family."
"5.0","This place was awesome. Our waiter George was prob the best waiter I've ever had. We had the grilled wings, pita chipsand pierogies for appetizer and they all were so good. I had the grilled chicken sandwich and mac and cheese. The sandwich was awesome and the mac and cheese was so good.. Deff recommend going here."
"1.0","Poor Management.As I work in the area, my co-workers and I eat here at least once a week.Today, I experienced total disaster and bad behavior at this restaurant.Granted, they were busy with walk in customers and GrubHub orders, so the wait time became a half hour.The workers today sadly had one speed...'slow'...either management can't convince them to move a bit faster when you are busy or they simply hire the wrong people.I politely asked to speak to a manager. Three times a manager was called to the front and three times that person did not show to speak with me despite my calmness and professionalism.On my way out, I did learn that manager today was 'Dave'. Oh well...'Dave you need to find another line of work'.Poor service is never a good thing,Anna Bartolini Brown"
"4.0","Came to the Summit for happy hour after my parents told me what a great time they had here. Cons of the Summit: even though it's on Mt Washington, you don't get that overlook view.  Pros on the Summit: the drinks; and Grandview Ave is only a block away if you need to see the city skyline after you have a few. Oh and there are charging outlets right under the bar, what a great feature! Happy hour is 5-7, during which cocktails are $6! It was a Tuesday, we walked in at 6, and there was plenty of seating. Even though I complained about the lack of view, the space does have a large window open to Shiloh street which is nice when the weather is good.  I had the Amabel and the Sex Tape. If you go and read the descriptions, you'll see that these are pretty close to the same thing (gin, grapefruit), but the Amabel was my favorite."
"4.0","Cool, chic village NYC vibe and crowd.  It's a nice more laid back lounge vibe option from the other restaurants and bars on Mount Washington. They also have a stunning painting behind the bar which deserves your attention.  Message me with your thoughts on it!"
"5.0","Brisket Hash is one of the best things to get anywhere for brunch in Pittsburgh.Great options and great food."
"2.0","Atmosphere was nice.  Ordered a pizza which was 'ok'.  Server never brought my Iced tea and took a while to bring the check.  Which was strange being that the restaurant was not packed.  No A/C and it was a warm evening.  Different but not impressive."
"5.0","This place is awesome! Great drinks, cool atmosphere, and delicious food! They have a really good happy hour too. One of my favorite bars!"
"4.0","Tamarind is usually a very good Indian restaurant, set cozily on the first floor of a house.  The dinner options are excellent, if a bit on the pricier side for the students they typically attract (the fact that it's usually full of students anyway is a testament to the quality and consistency).  Sauces are creamy and flavorful, while chunks of meat are tender and sizable.The one caveat: during lunch, you can only get the buffet (no individual ordering)--and on weekdays, the buffet is a little below average at best.  Avoid lunches Monday through Friday and you'll do just fine."
"1.0","My waitress was rude and completely out of pocket! I paid for my lunch with a credit card, and when she came back to the table to collect my signed receipt she points at it the receipt and says very loudly as with an attitude 'don't you want to tip?' I was completely taken aback and said 'No!' (The caveat is I never tip with my card, only with cash so had she not been rude and disrespectful she would have gotten a tip) She not only walks away with an attitude she proceeds to 'sneakily' take my picture with her cell phone. So I took one of her... HERES YOUR TIP - DONT ASK FOR A TIP JUST DO A GOOD JOB."
"5.0","Went across the street and ate here because Texas de Brazil had a two hour wait. Was a good decision all around because we were seated immediately and the food was amazing. I suggest the sukiyaki...it's a little pricey but a really cool experience and it's delicious."
"2.0","I'm not going to get into why I avoided dining at Fernando's when I've had the opportunity, but when Kay didn't feel like cooking this evening, and a flyer in the Pennysaver revealed that they delivered to Beechview (among many other neighborhoods!), we decided to take a leap off the stage...and nobody caught us. Ouch. Yup, 90 minutes (no kiddin'!) after we spoke to the genial lady on the phone (the coupons had the wrong expiration date on them), our barely lukewarm food arrived.Fernando's Roast Beef & American sub was the only stand-out. A sweet 'homemade Southwest dressing' that came off as Russian or Thousand Island complimented the supple, better-than-Arby's roast beef wonderfully. A bun that tasted freshly-baked, and of course American cheese and good 'ol l-t-o finished off what was a dandy of a grinder. Fernando's needs to stick with hoagies and nothing but. My side of potato salad tasted like chilled mashed potatoes with some mayonnaise folded into them. The four shrink-wrapped, Chips Ahoy-sized chocolate chip cookies I had for dessert cost me $2 and seemed to have been half-baked. The true dud of the entire meal was the Buffalo Chicken Pizza, however. On top of what was a strange sort of synthetic flatbread (see my review for the Bridgeville Philly Soft Pretzel Factory location) were cubes of 'grilled' chicken breast that had that tasted to have been boiled, a BBQ sauce that probably came from a bottle, a dull provolone/mozzarella/Romano blend, and raw vegetables (onions,mushrooms, green peppers). The advertised garlic was as invisible as a Stealth bomber. So, I'm gonna have to go with a 'no' on Fernando's, okayyy? Yeahhh...I've seen 'Office Space' a few too many times, yes, but I'm sure Lumberg would concur with my evaluation."
"5.0","Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. Staff was nice, facility looked brand new and super clean. Highly recommend."
"4.0","Gennaro's is one of my go to pizza delivery places. I tried someplace different last time just to see what's out there and regretted not ordering from Gennaro's. I usually get the 'Create your own Pizza' option which I usually special request crispy and it is! I like a place that gives you what you want.I also ordered their popular deep dish pizza and it was delicious. It was just a little much for me(too much crust, too much cheese), not my usual thin crust style, but I'm glad I tried it. I have never had bad pizza from there, the cheese taste good, so I'll keep it in my 'go to' file under pizza delivery."
"1.0","Worst service ever. The owner literally kicked us out in the middle of a birthday party."
"3.0","After running around all darn night and morning getting ready for my vacay I decided to stop in the capital grill for lunch. I was greeted immediately upon my arrival and the hostess stand checked my coat and luggage. It wasn't busy at all for a Thursday afternoon I would have to blame it on the rain because the menu options were superb. I was torn I came in to try out the restaurant week menu but I couldn't take my eyes off the lobster roll and Parmesan truffle . I ordered a goose Bloody Mary which was decent heavy on the goose which I prefer...The bartender Katie was kinda distanced at first but me and another patron got her talking and she warmed up quickly:). As shown in my pics the serving size for the fries and the roll was good for a lunch portion . Now when I think of Parmesan truffle fries I think of shoestring style fries I was presented with thick cut fries with no Parmesan....now don't get me wrong y'all know I haven't met a fry I didn't like . It's just I had a different thing pictured.  The lobster roll could've had more seasoning it was pretty bland The brioche roll was to die for. Was I dissatisfied with my lunch noooo I was way to hungry for that was I blown away... not this time"
"5.0","This place schmacks. Crispy and chewy naan, perfectly spiced dishes, and amazing gulab jamun. Very fair pricing + filling. Nice waiters. Offered us a free dessert."
"4.0","This place is absolutely wonderful! I came here with a couple of friends on a Friday night and the staff was very welcoming and nice. We ordered the samosas for appetizer, which were just phenomenal. The food did not take long to come to our table and the waiter explained many of dishes to us, which was so helpful. We got several different chicken curries and rice. I ordered the spinach dosa, however it was not as good as the chicken curries. I would definitely order the non-vegetarian entrees here instead of the vegetarian ones. Otherwise, great place with such a warm atmosphere. I will definitely be coming back here!"
"4.0","I was here a couple of times for team lunches. Both the times, I liked the food. It is such a vibrant place! Food is fresh and light, yet filling. The last time I was here I ordered roasted veggie sandwich with chick pea salad. I liked the food and I am sure I will go back again. Things to remember:1) They are busy during lunch hours and you should be prepared to wait for at least 10 minutes for your food to arrive.2) If you are planning to go in a group, make sure you are there before the rush hour to easily find a table for everyone at one place.3) Don't hesitate to order the bbq sliders if they are offering, my colleagues were happy with the sliders they ordered."
"1.0","So first time here and ordered a cappuccino and veggie omelet. The waitress brought my 'cappuccino' that looked more like a latte. I asked to confirm this was the cappuccino, and she said 'yes that's how I make my cappuccino.'.....Next, my veggie omelet came and I expected the cheese to be melted, but it was not. I guess they do things very differently at Caffe Mona La Bistro. The owner was generous enough to comp our meal. Thank you but it's a no for me."
"5.0","A totally unique and open 3rd floor space feels fun and cool. This location made a perfect birthday surprise spot for my amazing fiancé. Not only because of this great third floor bar, but because of the wonderful Italian restaurant on the second floor (just take the elevator back down to entry floor and walk up the stairs to 2). Loved the appetizers and the craft beers on tap, hard cider options and wine - everyone can order their favorite drink here. I cannot wait to visit again especially in the summer when the roof is open. Even in early Oct with the roof closed, this unique space made for a perfect start to a special bday celebration. Service was great too!"
"4.0","Cheese. The Steve Urkel food of champions. I love cheese...so why not put cheese in your pancakes?Raymond's pancakes are to die for. Thick, uber moist, not too dense, and they contain ricotta cheese. That's the secret ingredient! We both had the blueberry pancakes, big fat juicy purple blueberries nestled in those luscious ricotta pancakes.  Too die for. You get one little cup of syrup, it's a buck for n extra syrup. A little ridiculous. The orange juice was really wonderful. We both agreed that we were not expecting to be wowed by orange juice, but it was super tasty. The bacon was thick, perfectly cooked and meaty. I'm so glad we ducked in to his place. Nice decor, good seating in and out. We ate at a little table on the sidewalk. Nice, busy vibe happening on the strip. Inside they had a great display of pastries. Wish I would've had some room but I was stuffed. Everyone loves Raymond's."
"5.0","Had a really nice dinner. Koy was our server who was excellent. We did the restaurant week dinner which is a great deal but also did the generous pour which if you like wine is a great deal. Food was very good and wine was delicious. Highly recommend. We like the steak restaurants for restaurant week and this was exceptional. Kudos to Koy to being an excellent server."
"3.0","My wife and I went here late night after a concert at Stage AE.  We ordered nachos and chicken quesadillas.  They were good, not great.  Server was friendly and attentive.  I would go back again for some late night bar food.  It was one of the only couple places still serving food, so I give them props for being open late.  One warning, the quesadillas and nachos come packed with black olives.  I love them, but my wife hates them.  I picked them off for her and all was good."
"5.0","Great neighborhood spot with delicious cocktails and bites. They have a lot of board games that you can play with friends and a great vibe with the music and staff. Short walk to the overlooks on Mt Washington so it makes for a great date or a stop with friends while showing off the city! I got the Leona cocktail and will be back again!"
"5.0","Awesome burger!!!Fast, friendly service.Try the fried goat cheese appetizer.  I'm not from around here but will be back."
"3.0","I've been to the buffet a few times and the food is all right. Their rice on the buffet ends up really dry. It could be just cooked wrong, or else it's been on the buffet way too long. It's a smaller buffet, so options are limited. It's not the best Indian buffet in the area, but it's really cheap and close to Pitt and UPMC, so it's convenient, and they have a discount with ID. It's always really dim there though, and the booths are not very comfortable, a lot of the seats sink in awkwardly. I've never seen is crowded, so it seems the general consensus is that it's not great. The staff is sometimes on the phone making personal calls when you're trying to pay, which is frustrating.We ordered delivery from there through Grubhub last night at 7:40pm. The food was supposed to arrive around 9:00. We called them, and they said they never got the fax from Grubhub, but then conveniently received it when on the phone with us. They said they'd send the food out. We called again around 10 since the food hadn't arrived still, but they were closed so nobody answered. Then we had to call Grubhub, who said the problem was not on their end and that the fax was received. They talked to the delivery person who said that he was on the way. Finally 5 minutes later the food came, but the delivery guy said he couldn't get up the hill because of snow and asked us to come down. When we brought the food in, the one thing was wrong, which meant our vegetarian friend didn't even have anything she could eat. The rice in our order was super dry, almost crunchy, like they just packaged up whatever was left on the buffet. The naan was good. I liked my saag. I tried someone else's chicken vindaloo and it was good, but not spicy at all. I'm not sure what actually happened with the fax, but it's really convenient that they got the fax exactly when we were on the phone with them. The order was messed up with no way to fix it so late at night, so one person didn't even get to eat."
"5.0","Been here a few times last year. Great atmosphere and great staff. Try the Blood and Sand or the Moscow Mule."
"4.0","The best part of our dining experience here was our waiter George.... he was a delight to talk to and he was very knowledgeable of the menu and the resturant itself.... I would just go back to be served by him again..... now the food itself was also good per George's suggestion the Mac and cheese just AMAZING and 'game day punch' very yummy bar beverage.... the only down side and unfortunately a big one is cleanliness... the entire place needs a really good scrub down especially ladies bathroom!"
"5.0","Recommended by coworker who had an excellent dinner during restaurant week. My experience echoes hers. I went with family including adult children and in-laws and from the moment we entered we were treated to a divine dining experience. The BYOB adds to the pleasure. The hummus, Gouda, crab cakes, risotto and other entrees were shared and enjoyed by all. Although we couldn't finish entrees, we treated ourselves to yummy desserts which capped a marvelous evening."
"4.0","Nice and solid 3.5-stars for some solid AmericanItalian food!Service was really really friendly and the portions were really generous.It doesn't compare to your top-rated traditional Italian joint because that's not what it is.It's really more of an unpretentious mom and pop spot, with consistent hearty meals.Great stop for lunch or dinner, and cozy family atmosphere.We ate, we laughed, and had a very relaxed meal with coffee and dessert at the end.Drinks were refilled seamlessly and leftovers carefully packaged.Would definitely come by again!"
"5.0","I've been here twice now for breakfast and it's amazing.  The seating is packed but they help you find a table and the food is consistently great.  The croissant sandwiches are excellent, but seriously get a pastry!"
"3.0","My wife and I came here with a a couple of friends. The sever was very excited, almost to the point of being obnoxious, but she was helpful. It was restaurant week, so they offered a limited menu, we all head the quinoa meatballs, which took some getting use to, but we ended up enjoying them. They brought a house salad course next that I felt was unnecessary. The white balsamic vin was really good. The final course was an option of stuffed pumpkin ravioli with honey crisp apple cream sauce or the daily risotto. Both options were really good the sauce on the ravioli was smooth and buttery and the risotto was filled with bacon Italian cheeses, red peppers, and bleu cheese . Great choices ! We all decided to get to dessert, we could of skipped this portion of our dinner. Enjoy!"
"4.0","This place needs to be bigger! Yummy tacos, tender meat, flavorful and great prices! The workers were very accommodating to our young children too! My only complaint would be the nachos, they were to smothered in cheese sauce which made them super soggy. Some people might like that but I wasn't a fan..."
"3.0","Loud as hell... Didn't bother me until someone else mentioned it. But I can't even speak to the server or the person I'm with without having to raise my voice. It's not the music just voices. LolWent in on a Friday for happy hour. Super busy took a while to be seen and to get our drinks. When food came it was a little cold. Didn't really have a horrible experience but not the greatest. Happy hour prices aren't really that happy. The girl who was training to be server was very nice and polite, she'll do just fine!"
"3.0","Sausalido attempts to be a quaint Mediterranean bistro. I believe the intimate atmosphere accommodates that very well, and the service is admirable. It is a good place to take a date, which I did (pimpin aint easy, I know). From there, the maitre d is accommodating with the corkage and you can let all your conversational juices flow over a nice glass of red wine. The staff likes to give appetizers on the house, which are generally delicious. I found several other appetizers to be well prepared, but very basic. I believe one was akin to a cheesy baked potato with bacon. Those are always tasty, but  I could make that when I was a culinary challenged college student.My main course was a simple seafood and veggie pasta a la oligio. It seemed a bit bland, and would have probably been better with fresh cracked black pepper, some truffle salt, and shredded Gruyere. When a restaurant is trying to convey an attitude of beauty through simplicity, the utmost attention must be given to a dish to justify its price point. Yes, pasta is simple, but there needs to be a delicate balance of high quality flavors to make the simple into elegant.I still enjoyed the experience, but feel Sausalido is encountering the troubles that I see of other up and coming Pgh restaurants. They are trying to be something through their image, but not accounting for the details which bring it to life. You can get away with that in Pgh, but it wouldn't fly in a larger city."
"5.0","Fernando's is a wonderful place to stop in for a bite to eat. The wait staff are quite friendly if you take the time to speak with them, and the food is delicious. We host monthly gatherings at the restaurant with the blessing of the owner and staff, and everyone is excited to come back month after month for another lasagna wrap or sub. I've found their gourmet pizza to be to-die-for. They changed their hours last summer to capture more business, and I think it's only helped them out. It's certainly brought myself and my friends their way more often than during AC every summer."
"5.0","Had the Fox Chapel burger, which was amazing. The fresh-cut rosemary fries were the best fries I've ever had. Awesome New England IPA. Highly recommend this whole meal from a foodie with high standards."
"5.0","Let me tell you friends, I've been on a MASSIVE seafood kick lately!  It's not just sushi though, it's everything and I want it well prepared and cooked to perfection.  So you walk into a place with the name 'Wholey' and you expect it to 'wow' you.  And you know what?  It did!I was surprised to see the less than stellar reviews at first, but I had faith it was just the new restaurant jitters.  We came in on a random Tuesday night around 8pm and was surprised to see about 6 other tables full with diners.  Surprising to see in the Strip, but exciting, if you ask me!  It's an absolutely gorgeous space.  Nothing you would expect from the Strip at this point and time.  It actually used to be a club, so there's many different levels.  I love the sea of blues and mosaic tiles.  The tables are large, so it's great for big parties.  We started out with the Sashimi appetizer and it was so cold and fresh.  I loved the tiny mandarin oranges and crisp lettuce surrounding it.  We devoured it within 3 seconds of it hitting the table.  Good start!The tomato salad will probably only be on the menu for a short time, considering the season for them ends soon, but it's worth having when you can.  You can easily throw together some tomatoes and splash on some balsamic.  This had a very well done pesto sauce and pine nuts.  I would have never thought of the combo together, but I loved it!  I ordered the Scallops and Shrimp, which came with a hearty helping of jasmine rice and grilled bok choy.  Both the Scallops and Shrimp were seared to perfection and the scallops, which I find hard to season well, had a great flavor and were large in size.  I loved the creamy garlic sauce drizzled on top.  It was as if every element of the dish came together in harmony!  While seafood can be expensive, and this was no exception for a $24 meal, I had no qualms about paying my bill for the amount of flavor that was packed into each dish.  Fresh is the word here and you won't have to reel me in... I'm coming on my own!"
"4.0","First time eating at a Thai place--success! I had the thai fried rice and my fiance had the pad thai. Both were hot and delicious. We had plenty of leftovers to have a couple more meals out of it too! It's small, but they have places to sit and our server was very attentive."
"1.0","Worst Taco Bell I've ever been to. I've been there a handful of times over the past few months and have left with a complaint every single time. I've had forgotten items, terrible quality food, poor customer service, overcharging for items and rude manager interactions. The incompetence of the staff and management is mind boggling. Tonight was the final straw and I will never return to this location. Taco Bell is my favorite fast food restaurant and it's such a disappointment to have to be so negative about a great chain. For Taco Bell fans, it's very worth it to take the extra drive to the West View or the McKnight road location. Do not dine at this location, I guarantee you will be disappointed."
"4.0","Good food, nice variety of dishes... I subtracted one star only because it's more of a casual place, cafeteria-style."
"5.0","During my second visit to Pittsburgh, I had to ensure I had breakfast at another Pamela's restaurant. Their food does not disappoint. It is a greasy spoon type of diner that you just know will be great. Their potatoes are just one reason to come back again and again."
"3.0","Went to redbeards for dinner and drinks before a concert at the Benedum Center. Overall pretty unsatisfied with the food. We had pierogis, steak fries, and wings. If you are looking for ok bar food this place will suffice. Decent beer prices as well."
"5.0","I've been here twice and have loved everything. The croissant is huge and flaky. I got some pastry with apricot that was amazing (don't remember what it's called). And the macarons....amazing. I ate 6 in one setting. The raspberry are my favorite. They open at 7:30am which is perfect for when I get to work early and want to get something for breakfast. They are quick, knowledgeable, and give great service. Plus, it's super cute inside!"
"4.0","It was enjoyable. A little on the pricey side but I also don't frequent sushi joints to often so I'm not the most reliable source. The hostess was great! When we arrived without a reservation she put us on the waiting list and also told us the bar was first come, first serve. She walked by the bar to check out the anticipated wait and noticed if I couple moved down one seat we would be able to be seated right away. She kindly asked them and they obliged - so we got a spot at the bar within minutes of arriving! Great customer service!"
"5.0","Great food, good atmosphere, good service.  A fine combination.We went with our two kids on a weeknight. The food was all well prepared, and they were great about working with our kids for things that would suit their tastes.  It all worked, and I'll certainly be back."
"2.0","I came here the Steeler game on Monday night with two of my friends. The space is nice and roomy with a lot of seating. My friends and i found a table at the bar area and sat there. I will start by saying two things: 1) our waiter came right over and asked for our drink orders (i like that) and 2) the bar area was a little busy, not definitely not completely full. He brought us back our drinks and then went on to another table. He wanted to put an app in, but our waiter never came back. Finally when he did, he brought another guy over and said that since they were so busy (they weren't) that they would both be helping us out tonight. A while later, the original waiter comes back over and says 'he's taking care of you now, right? Okay good.' Then ran away as fast as he came. At this time we were still waiting to put our appetizer order in. Finally about a half hour later, the second guy comes over and asks if we needed anything. (My water was empty). At that time, we put in our appetizer order, some more drink orders, and i asked for more water, because we didn't know when he'd be back. He came back about 10 minutes later with our appetizer and then about 10 minutes after that when our drink orders. A while later he came back to take our dinner orders. Two of us got salads and the third person for a turkey burger. It took almost 45 minutes for our food to arrive and was brought out by someone else. A half hour after our food came out, our waiter came back and was very anxious to give us our check. He did not check to see how our food was nor did he refill our drinks. Once he dropped off the checks, he was very quick to take our checks and bring them back. We stayed until the end of the game and he didn't come back to check on us once we cashed out. He didn't offer any more water or anything. On top of that, the food was nothing exciting. I gave this place 2 stars because the atmosphere and warm and inviting and it is a great place to watch a game. But, i probably won't be back."
"5.0","There is only one steak, and its name is ribeye!  Can't beat the ribeye cooked in the 1500 degree oven at CG.  What do you need for a good steak?  Quality meat, the right cut (and I go ribeye), minimal seasoning, and technique with a good hot oven!Started with the calamari, Rodney Strong Cabernet, spinach and bacon salad, finished with that great ribeye!Remember, its all about the marbling!"
"4.0","I have been wanting to try this place, and Restaurant Week seemed like a good time! It is a little different than the other breweries in Lawrenceville, because it is set up like a restaurant that also brews their own beer, as opposed to the other way around. We did not make a reservation, but I recommend doing so if you plan on coming for dinner via Open Table (esp if you have more than 2 people).  We arrived about 6:45 on a Friday and were told it would be about a 90 minute wait. There didn't seem to be too many people standing around, so we decided to just wait it out and luckily, something opened up after about 10 minutes or so. Both myself and my boyfriend ordered from the Restaurant Week special menu. The 'deal' of a sandwich and a beer for $20.19 was not really a special in itself looking at the prices of food and brews on the regular menu, but we were interested in the sandwiches. I ordered the Meatloaf Sandwich and it was 10/10. I normally would not order meatloaf at a restaurant but it was pictured online, and it looked amazing. I was not disappointed. He ordered the Parmesan Chicken sandwich, which he did not like. It was prepared  using chicken thigh, which was too greasy and just not good as part of this dish. Seasoned shoestring-style fries were good and overall, portions were very generous.We were pleased with the beers on tap. They had about 6 different options available at the time-- all their own brews. There was nothing super special or unique about them, but there was one of each style (pilsner, IPA, sour, stout, etc.), so I think that most beer drinkers could find at least one that they liked. I noticed that there were about 15 taps, so I imagine that they will be adding more beers to the list as they continue to expand and grow their business. Service was great. Our waiter was very friendly and the wait-staff seemed to work as a time to make sure that everyone was taken care of. Our water glasses were never empty! I would definitely return for dinner and a beer. The menu is pretty small so be sure to check it out beforehand. You can actually see the kitchen if you are sitting in the front part of the restaurant and it is pretty small itself. You can tell that they put a lot of effort into having good, quality food that pairs well with their beers. If anyone from the restaurant is reading this, please make the Meatloaf Sandwich a staple on your menu :)"
"2.0","Great Bar, Great bartenders, great food, NO AC DURING FOOTBALL GAMES AT THE BAR!!!  3 people left already because of t, people complained so they opened the door, lol, 90 degrees outside"
"4.0","I ordered 'damn hot' - it's spicy, but definitely not as spicy as I expected. Especially after reading through the comments prior to ordering. Sandwich is entirely too large for one sitting. The fries were just alright, but I probably wouldn't order again."
"4.0","I love the space and the concept of the three story venue each offering something different. Mezzo (2nd floor restaurant) offers great food at somewhat reasonable prices.         Start with a cheese board and a bread selection, small portions but totally worth it. We felt the best way to try this menu would be to order a few things to split and we were right. The spicy shrimp pasta was AWESOME. Had a real kick to it but bearable. Margherita pizza was tasty too.         Before or after your reservation (or both) check out the bar on the third floor. I'm really excited to have dinner at the restaurant on the first floor as well. So much to do in that area!"
"1.0","No air conditioning in restaurant!  Food was good but they shouldn't even be open on a 90 degree day!"
"5.0","This food was wonderful! Great appetizer, soup, and main course. It's also BYOB so it makes it quaint but extremely tasty. Can't wait to go back!"
"4.0","Chik'N, the new Nashville-inspired chicken joint in the heart of Oakland is basically the real deal. Ratings and descriptions below:Chicken sandwich- hot; 4.3/5Ample heat, moist chicken breast, and a tangy coleslaw on brioche fill out a pretty amazing sandwich. Heat level of 'Hot' has a spice that you can enjoy while eating, yet doesn't leave a lingering sting. If I had to offer one improvement, I wish the breading was crispier. Mac n cheese; 4.6/5The Mac n cheese is a standout on the menu. A rich and thick white cheese sauce over elbow macaroni is topped with some colorful paprika, and tastes just about as good as it gets, although I could see how someone may think it's too thick. French fries; 3.5/5The French fries are crinkle-cut and also seasoned with a spice blend. Seeming to be of the priorly frozen variety, they were crispy and seasoned well, but uninspired. Ambiance; 4.2/5The building itself is large, with ample seating downstairs accompanying the counter and kitchen, and upstairs is a large TV and more seating. There seemed to be about 10 beers on tap and a hearty selection of bottles. While we took our food to-go, you wouldn't have to twist my arm to come back and eat-in. Service; 4.7/5Fast and efficient. The cashiers were taking orders and also bussing tables and wiping counters, while the cooks were busy whipping up your meal in plain sight. These people were rapid-fire cranking out orders. We went in on a Tuesday evening, but it was fairly busy. Kudos to them. Value; 4.4/5This place does not accept cash, which is no biggie (rewards points on credit cards, duh), and the menu was fairly priced with decent sized portions. Later, raters!-Pat"

"5.0","This place is amazing! All the food here is delicious and everyone who works here is really kind, especially the owners. The ambience is great and the outdoor patio is decorated really nicely with cute umbrellas! Highly recommend this restaurant for coffee, breakfast, brunch, and lunch."
"3.0","With many food trucks to choose from at the food truck festival at the Meadows casino, this is where we ended up. Definitely something on the menu for everyone. My XXX hot cheesesteak was delicious and different. It was made on exceptionally good bread. My wife's burger was so so she said. Again it was different. Fresh cut fries were good but many many small pieces. Could've used a fork to eat them but didn't have one. Food was made in a timely matter. Items were priced good. Service was great, helpful, and friendly."
"4.0","Was in the neighborhood...heard so many great stories on the soft shell crab bloody Mary's...photo attached. went to the bar...early afternoon...not crowded...had tell 3 people behind the bar. what I wanted...15 minutes later finally received my drink. I would say tasty...I order the tuna appetizer...that was good. was not impressed with services...the women behind bar where more worried about conversation with some guy. would I go back...maybe"
"5.0","Perfect burger establishment. What an amazing restaurant   from all the local beers ingredients and decor....everyone needs to experience this piece of pittsburgh heaven. Can't speak enough about the delicious burgers and chicken sandwiches"
"2.0","The two large cheese pizzas we received had very little cheese and nearly half of the actual pizza surface on both were bare dry crust. I would recommend ordering elsewhere. They have simply gotten skimpy with the cheese and sauce.... This place used to be great years ago."
"5.0","This place is amazing. I was recently here and started with the bread and butter. What is in the butter. Oh my god. Delicious. The bread was incredible. We also got the bruschetta which was not traditional but amazing. I had the risotto and honestly dream about it. Not your usual take on risotto. Everyone else had pizza and they loved it. It was a great meal. Our server was a darling!"
"4.0","Stopped in after work on Friday night after hearing on KDKA, Cinderlands is on the verge of being the best brewery in all the land. This was my second stop in, so I already knew the atmosphere and I like it. The menu, 'foodie' items which are a real nice change of pace. I however was surprised that they only had about 5 beers on tap. They only serve their own. Couple of sours, 3 IPA's, Dad's Lager....I was left a bit disappointed. I mean, I love craft beer but when I am out to have some, I do not want a 'lager'. Not a fan of IPA's. The lager however was good. We had the buffalo rillettes and fries both of which were very good. My husband was a fan of the scotch egg. Large with a nice presentation."
"5.0","Visited during crabfest with family.  Sea-crab soup and mahi-mahi tacos were great.  Family had snow & king crabs legs.  They were happy.  Kids loved their food and service was great."
"4.0","I've ordered lunch delivery from this place a few times since I work downtown and it's a quick, easy lunch. I was even more impressed when I went to the actual restaurant! This place is huge--you would have no idea from the outside. The best part is their egg rolls. They are definitely homemade and GIGANTIC. Apparently they also do jumbo egg rolls which I can only imagine are the size of a burrito since the regular ones are so hefty! I've had a few of the basic dishes here and have never been disappointed--Shrimp Lo Mein, General Tsos, Chicken & Broccoli. While I don't ever mind dark meat chicken, I know others who really appreciate that you have the option of ordering white or dark with their General Tso's platter.Whether you want a sit-down meal, take-out or delivery--this is a great place to check out!"
"5.0","Came here to meet a friend for coffee. She had a specialty latte and I enjoyed a traditional latte. We both really enjoyed our drinks and loved the atmosphere here. The customer service we experienced and saw with other customers was phenomenal. Truly, the woman working could not have been kinder or more patient with the customers she had. We had a really great time here and can't wait to come back to try their food next time. Their lunch items sound delicious! This is truly a new gem in Bloomfield!"
"3.0","Good food at a good price. I ordered the Gails breakfast: ok scrambled eggs with delicious lyonaise potatoes and really good wheat toast. I'd definitely go back again"
"1.0","The pizza was absolutely rancid. I live in a place riddled with horrible 99 cent pizza places which are so bad, a pita with ketchup and government cheese would be comparable. This is WORSE than that. The bread sticks were ... edible, the hotwings were about as good as Dominos (when they feel like being stingy with the sauce), but the onion rings were garbage. Probably frozen, definitely processed, and tasted like cold mashed potatoes that just got a divorce. If this is the only place open and you're hungry late at night, drink some water and have a good breakfast the next day."
"5.0","Food was okay service was bad, took 30 min before anyone even looked pat my son and I, too bad we were hoping for better."
"4.0","We had lunch here after a tour of Heinz field. It was the perfect stop for us. It was a 5-10 minute walk from the stadium.We got there around 1pm so it was not crowded. We were seated immediately. The food is typical grill food. We had burgers and a buffalo chicken sandwich. Both were good and served quickly. There is a lot of interesting memorabilia of Jerome and signatures of people who have eaten there. Plus there were lots of tvs if you wanted to go and watch a sporting  event.It also has  outdoor seating."
"5.0","OMG best pancakes ever. Do yourself a favor and get the nation's greatest pancake ever - banana chocolate chip. I still have fond food memories about my single Pamela's experience - almost 4 years later. I need these pancakes back in my life!"
"2.0","Nothing special about this place other than you'll be disappointed you wasted your money on their pizza. Ordered a slice while walking the south side.  No real taste, dough was flimsy and pizza was greasy. Staff was very friendly, place was clean so I gave a second star.  Otherwise pass this one up unless you're r desperate."
"5.0","Tried Edgar's at a food truck rally. The tacos were amazing. It has become a goal to stumble upon this food truck again."
"5.0","This is the best Mexican food I've ever had; they have a variety of choices, and my partner and I split two different Burritos, ground beef and I believe a pork filling?. They were both delicious. We also got a variety of empanadas and salsa and it was all incredible. Be warned that their spicy salsa is SPICY, they are not messing around, but it is also flavorful!"
"5.0","Godd#$*m delicious.  I am a major fan of the Cajun fries always fresh hot and completely covered in a smokey savory Cajun spice blend with a side of home made ranch that is so good at cooling your hot mouth. On my last visit I got a tuna melt which did not disappoint.  The tuna salad taste like how mom makes and was served with the additional of lettecue, tomatoes and onion and melted American cheese."
"4.0","If I could rate the food at Sausilido it would be a solid 5 stars. I had the porkchop, which was the largest piece of pork I've ever seen. The sear was fantastic, and the middle was juicy and delicious. It came with cabbage and apples which was all right, but not anything spectacular. My friends both had the crab cakes with risotto. The crab cakes were amazing. I didn't care for the risotto. I thought it was kind of bland. What really killed this place for me was the ambiance. It was extremely stuffy. It felt very uppity, like you didn't want to laugh. Other than that, the food, our server (Ed!!) was great!"
"5.0","All I have is a picture of the (INCREDIBLE) miso ramen but we had so much. The vibe of this place is so cool and the staff was so nice and helpful, especially for a (mostly) Japanese food virgin like myself. Will DEFINITELY be returning soon"
"4.0","I have never had anything other than their dosas. They are pretty good with a hefty portion of the potato filling and the sauces (sambar and chutney). I do like the dosas at Udipi better, but Tamarid is about a mile away from me, so I would sacrifice a bit of quality in exchange of a 20 mile round trip drive. I have, however, tried my friend's butter chicken. It was pretty darn good! It was nothing like the common creamy butter chicken that you see if EVERY north-Indian restaurant. This one had more of a chicken curry consistency, but it was oh-so-good! Their tandoori chicken that the same friend got another time, is a little blah. I wouldn't recommend that. Service is pretty good here."
"4.0","Pretty decent New York style pizza, with quick delivery."
"4.0","Best Korma in town! Over all, the prices are pretty fair for what you get, but I do wish that the naan would be a little bigger/more for what you pay."
"3.0","The only time I ever see this place is during Anthrocon, so my experience may be a lot different from other Yelpers. What I noticed is even though the restaurant is busy during the convention, they have extra staff behind the counter to keep the line moving. That said, their subs are average at best. I actually do like the place more for breakfast than for lunch or dinner because at breakfast time, I can get a whopping big pile of ham, sausage, bacon and egg on a bun, and the coffee is free. The only thing that seemed sketchy to me is on the third day of the convention, I noticed that they taped over the part of the menu where it says chips and drink come with a combo meal."
"5.0","The place for Smile. Oh is it ever! Eat & Park really knows how to make dining a streamlined experienced. They are the classic Pittsburgh family establishment. After starting with one restaurant, they've grown into a chain that has been perfected! My families kids LOVE this place & I love Eat N Park for providing us with such a stress free dining option. The menu options are extensive. They have something for everyone's dining needs- diabetic, allergies, celiac, small portions for kids & seniors, picky eaters... it's amazing just what they've thought of! I can't think of any other restaurant in the country that offers what Eat N Park does! Our family has many favorites- just to name a few, the chicken soup is heavenly. As is the fish sandwich w mac & cheese during Lent. There are just so many choices- it really is almost impossible to review just one meal. The thing about Eat N Park is that the menu is straightforward & the calories, ingredients, and all details are readily available upon request. This makes finding a dish that suits ones individual tastes easy and exceptional. Personally, I think you can't go wrong with the hot turkey sandwich & French fries - all covered in gravy. Delicious!  So very delicious!  And we can't forget to mention the Smiley Cookies. They are iconic! Do not leave without having one if you're dining for the first time! The Smiley Cookies are absolutely the best part. Or maybe the stickies are. Or the the pies. No. The Smiley Cookies are the best... or maybe the stickies.  They are all so amazing! You might have to try them all and decide for yourself!"
"2.0","I worked at a Panera when I was in undergrad, and the standards were much higher than this one. My food is always sloppily prepared, my orders are frequently wrong, and the wait times are excessive. I know it is a busy location, but the Panera I worked at was the busiest in its franchise and our wait times never got like that.I used to love Panera, and I still enjoy other locations, but this one is seriously lacking."
"4.0","A new joint on the main drag. The good thing about this place is that it's now easily the best chicken place on campus since popeye's is bust. Food is delivered fairly quickly, and it's what you expect: chicken! Don't be a fool though..  Hot and Damn Hot will severely hurt you! I got Hot chicken and waffles and I was in a lot of pain."
"1.0","Awful service at this cafe! The staff is not friendly at all! They treat you as you are in a dorm cafeteria! I went there with a group of friends. We had to stay in the line for an hour to order our food even with the reservation. Then they wanted to kick us out because we were staying there longer than they expected!!  It was my friend 's birthday and we asked for extra utensils and they said they cannot provide it and we have to leave in 15 min!! We asked for the manager who was very aggressive and started yelling at my friend! I won't go back here! The food is ok; not a 4-star quality at all!"
"3.0","The atmosphere and location are great for a casino restaurant, but the food has gone downhill from the last time I ate here about 3 years ago. I had Monterey chicken and my biggest complaint is the the chicken tasted fake!  At a price if $17, I expect to get a decent piece of chicken. On a side note, all the other casinos across the country where I've eaten... the food is cheap, the drinks are free and I win money at least some of the time. But nope, you'll see none of this at the Rivers Casino."
"4.0","Great place to go on a Saturday or Sunday morning after drinking way too much. The hotcakes are unbelievable but I am a really big fan of their home fries. I also really like their corned beef hash. I'll usually get some sort of omelette and pair it with a hotcake (usually chocolate but blueberry is pretty good too). I'll then make sure there is plenty of home fries and get a side of the corned beef hash. This usually puts me in a food coma but makes me feel fantastic especially after waking up a little hungover or still drunk from the night before.Oh. you have to pay with cash. And this location is also pretty packed so there is usually a line up outside. But it's so worth it."
"4.0","Ambions-Nice for gora chamda's- brown chamdas look else where! I'm serious, you will not like eating at a neat & clean place like one of those stylish service and quantity of those of peasantsFood-Nice level of spice and don't forget to mention that you want Indian spice.Overall- I might check in if I'm in that area"
"4.0","Prince of India has a solid, though not expansive, buffet. Last dinner buffet I had there included very good chicken tikka masala, saag, tandoori chicken, excellent chili chicken, turnip masala, vegetable korma, and channa masala, plus a small salad and dessert bar. Rice also, of course. You also get unlimited self serve soft drinks included in the price.At lunch, there is naan on the buffet, but at dinner you get fresh naan of your choice, which is a delicious upgrade. The buffet food is always good, but could be a bit more aggressively spiced. I understand why buffets are never spiced 'hot,' but some dishes here could just use more flavor. I have had a la carte several times, and it's excellent. However, as with other Indian restaurants, the portions are really small for the price, so I tend to stick to the buffet. UPMC and student discounts, too."
"3.0","Came here for bunch one day, trying a new spot! Every picture I saw online looked amazing so I wanted to see for myself! You place an order at the counter, pick a seat, grab water or coffee, and wait. I ordered the BBQ brisket hash and 1 blueberry ricotta pancake. The food came out quick and was so yummy! The brisket was amazing and I loved the spice of the BBQ sauce. I would recommend that hands down!The only negative I had with this restaurant is the unnecessary use of single use plastics.. For some reason our syrup was given to us in little single use plastic cups with lids and it seemed very undeed. It's becoming increasingly important to think about things like that and I would have appreciated it more if it came in a reusable dish or ramekin."
"1.0","All I can say that this place is not clean at all (also for some reason the place is full of flies). If this is what your costumers see in the dining area, I wonder what the kitchen looks like... The employees, however, are way better and friendlier than they used to be. The heat level is STIL inconsistent, my husband order another sandwich after he was done with the first and the jump in the heat level was crazy. I went approximately a week after I posted this review. I was very happy to see them improving the juiciness/quality of their chicken and the spiciness levels (I really hope they stay consistent when I visit them next time). However, sadly the place is still not clean (especially the tables) and there are a lot of flies whicI came to this place when they first opened. And I come pretty regularly as they're the only Nashville hot chicken place around. The only reason I'm writing this review is because I would really like to see some improvements. This is the list of things that I think they can easily improve: 1- the people working here have a negative energy. 2- the tables are always dirty every time I come. I think they should assign someone to wipe the tables after each party. Wish they would care more about the cleanliness of the place.3- the last couple of time I visited I noticed that the chicken is dry and not juicy at all. 4- (MOST IMPORTANT AREA OF IMPROVEMENT) The spiciness level is NOT consistent! When they first opened the medium was too mild for my husband so he had to start eating the hot. Suddenly it became too spicy and he had to downgrade to medium then the medium became too mild... etc. As for me (a person who loves the heat) the hot was too mild for me but the damn hot was actually waaaay too spicy (the jump in heat was ridiculous to the point I couldn't take more than one bite) I wish they would either add a new level between the hot and damn hot or make the jump more reasonable (by either making the hot actually hot or dropping the heat a notch with the damn hot) 5- last time I came here the fries was cold and not fresh at all!"
"4.0","I recently went to the summit before a yelp event. I live in Mt. Washington but haven't really come across any places that I really enjoyed getting cocktails at. The summit always seemed appealing to me but also, tended to be a little too busy each time I walked by (not a bad thing, I know). I chose to meet a friend before heading to the Grandview bakery and I am extremely sad that I have not gone before.I did not have any of the food but it all looked good. One stand out i remember was their spring pea ravioli, which sounded fresh and delicious. I did have two cocktails. The bartenders seemed incredibly knowledgeable and really friendly. I ordered a drink that I believe was called 'Donnie Darko' like the movie. This drink is pretty much my existence in a glass. There was rye and a hazelnut maple syrup. Simple and amazing. I also had another drink that I do not remember the name of. I only remember jalapeno and gin were in it. Also, it was gooood. The heat was at the beginning and not on the finish, which I usually find with pepper-based cocktails. It was smooth and not overly sweet. I would have more to rave about if the other drink was not even better. I will definitely be going back to the summit and the next time I will have food for sure!"
"1.0","Terrible service. Even the management is rude. Told our grandmother and grandfather they weren't allowed to sit at a table because they weren't ordering food. That was the start of it. The bar is boring with nothing good about it the only reason we went was because of proximity to the hotel. How they stay in business no idea"
"5.0","Great place, knowledgeable and alert bartenders, and the food is outstanding!!  Extensive selection of beer and house created cocktails are exceptional. Go here, well worth the stop."
"3.0","Average tasting pizza, nothing different or particularly delicious. The dough is very thin and doesn't have a whole bunch of flavor. Sauce is thinly put on and has a slight sweet flavor. We ordered pepperoni and sausage, which they did put a good amount of on top. They also put a good amount of cheese on the pizza. Their pizzas are pretty expensive for the quality and in comparison to other pizza restaurnts. We paid $24 for our large. If you're looking for pizza, it's a convenient and decent, just nothing overly amazing."
"2.0","Stopped in here for a small bite and drinks... not great. We decided on their Bloody Mary from the cocktail menu... it was super generic and no flavor other than the absurd amount of spice. It was so spicy that I could only take two drinks. I'm not one to return something because I didn't like it, but the bartender could have at least asked why I didn't drink it  We ordered the pierogies for our snack... again, no flavor!"
"5.0","Great prices, service, food, and atmosphere.   So happy i saw this on yelp.  Totally worth coming."
"3.0","Il Tetto has more to offer in terms of ambiance than food/drink. I was visiting from out of town for a work trip, so I was looking to try some local craft beers. Only a few on their list were local, and the draft prices were a little high. The bar snacks for also expensive for the quality. $10 for a plate of deviled eggs (5 or 6 halves) and another $10 or $11 for bruschetta (2 slices of toast). I was really excited to try the hummus, but it was super bland.  I wish you could order food downstairs from the pizza place and bring it up!"
"4.0","Nice atmosphere, delicious beer.  Haven't tried the food but looks great.  Wait staff very very nice."

"1.0","If I was able to give negative stars I would. I just got home from here for a relaxing dinner with my mother and aunt, I just wish I knew the service would be so bad before so we could have gone to McDonalds and been more satisfied. It took 15 minutes for our rude waitress to even come over and greet our table with a half ass smile and what I would assume a migraine from rolling her eyes so much at us. As you can tell the rest of our meal occurred in the same negligent fashion as previously stated.  The best part of the entire evening was watching our waitress run to her gang of fellow lazy waiters and laugh and point to our table reflecting on our frusterations in a passive aggressive fashion. Furthermore,  after ordering a simple shot that sat at the bar for 20 minutes, we figured it would be easier, faster and possibly more pleasant if we simply went up to the bar. There was our second horrible decision. The 3 bartenders were even more rude as they aimlessly walked past us ignoring our orders; counting down the minutes until happy hour was over. I would understand if I was the only upset one but there was another equally frusterated party next to us complaining about the same horrible service. I have never in my life put up with such horrifying service and I normally would not write a review but this experience completely ruined our entire mood and evening. I will never ever come back and make it a point to spread the word of such a terrible establishment run by horrible customer service."
"1.0","I am a big fan, and frequent visitor to Capital Grille. I had a bad experience during my last visit. Both my partner and I got sick (stomach) after the visit.Not expected from Capital Grille but unfortunately this happened.What made it even more frustrating was that I contacted company but did not get any response back."
"1.0","Worst Christmas ever...coming from out of town we wanted to watch the Steeler game and this was open. First they ran out of ranch dressing after we order all foods that we use it...who runs out of ranch?? Go get some?? Then I said please no lettuce or tomato on my sandwich...she drops it off and says sorry they put it on then walks away..then my sisters burger was so gross we all tried it it tasted old and like a ball of salt and too well done and we normally don't like to send back food that's why I kept my sandwich but her burger was so bad we had to send it back...whatever bad experience and bad food we chalked it up to...however, now my sister has food poisoning she has been up all night sick and not left the restroom...seriously like ruined our night and our Christmas her getting sick...we were just trying to do something different since our dad just passed two months ago...we should have stayed home and cooked..."
"5.0","Visited again!  I got confirmation - Sushi bar is first come first serve basis.Tableside tofu - AMAZING.  Get it.  So so good.  Skewers - still phenominal.  Rice ball with tuna - amazing.You can't go wrong with anything on the Umami Menu.  Go!"
"5.0","I never thought I'd find myself saying 'some of the best sushi I've had was in Pittsburgh.' Honestly, my wife and I were very skeptical about stopping into this place in a sleepy mall late on a Sunday night but wow did they deliver. The fish was fresh, the food was authentic and the service was fantastic. They've got a nice sake list as well. Great sushi. Turns out it's a hidden gem and according to the waiter people come from all over to eat here."
"4.0","This place is great!I may go 5-Stars, but I've only been there once. I'll be back, so I may reassess. What I like:- FOOD was great. More below. - Service was friendly. Warm even. - Setting is cool. Very clean and fresh inside what must be an old building. THE FOOD:Mine was great. I got a Raymond Burger, which is a pretty standard, large cheeseburger, with shredded lettuce, tomato, and 'special sauce.'  It was served with a hand full of wavy chips and a huge dill pickle (that was excellent, I might add).  It was served very hot (my preference), on a pretty basic bun, but the bun was warm and very soft, obviously fresh. While there is no 'secret ingredient' to this fairly standard burger, the execution was top notch. The beef was cooked medium well (trace of pink), and was very juicy. Excellent. My side salad was surprisingly large and also very fresh and crisp. Comprised mostly of field greens, it did have some nice olives, cucumber slices, and other food stuff I can't remember.  It came with a house vinaigrette that worked well. I see lots of all-day breakfast items on the menu, as well as lots of other sandwiches and burgers, so I need to go back and try more. I definitely can recommend this place quite highly. Give it a try and fling us your take on it!  Yelp on!"
"5.0","Awesome coffee and tea shop!  Cool environment to work and network in.  Reliable WiFi and good good!  They host live music a couple of times each month too."
"5.0","The all you can eat wings on Wednesday for $9.99 is a great deal.  I couldn't even eat the first portion.  Unlike some places that give you the 'junior' wings, their 'special' wings are jumbo as well.  Bartender actually paired a wine with Buffalo wings.  Now that's talent!"
"2.0","bartender was attentive and helpful with questions. beer was adequate, nothing outstanding. burgers were smallish and / or overpriced. fries were underwhelming if you like them crispy. happy hour is a nice value but was surprised how empty it was considering half price. glass bottle water was an unexpected twist, kind of sad that is what stands out. if you sit at the bar, beware of bartender dropping glass into trash (or recycling) startlingly loud!! not sure if it was deliberate, but it was annoying and likely not very safe. meh at best."
"5.0","4.5 stars.Enjoyed my night here with a mix of sake, cocktails, and small dishes. Fresh sushi is hard to find in Pittsburgh, but Umami delivers very well with their fresh sushi selections. Highly recommend the yellowtail if you haven't tried it yet. The skewers were also great, as there were many options, with ample quantities of meat on then.Atmosphere can be a bit loud, especially with the DJ and lots of people in the small room, but it's a fun time.Overall, the ability to try a variety of high quality Japanese dishes and an exciting restaurant vibe made for a memorable experience."
"4.0","I am going to refer to this as a hidden gem in the Oakland area.  Especially when you take into account how similar most other places are in the area.  This has definitely earned it's place on my short list to get some food from when I am looking for a quick order in a sea of similarity.If it wasn't for Yelp, I wouldn't have been able to have found this place.  Prior to my search I had not heard of this place from any of my friends or coworkers, nor had I seen a menu from this place.  Luckily for me they have a menu listed on their Yelp page and the prices/specials are accurate.  As soon as I told my coworkers I was going to order from there, they were eager enough to join me.We ended up ordering an array of items and after consumption our overall consensus of this place is that it is some good eats.  I had decided to order the three cheese Panini and was blown away by this.  Consisting of cheddar, mozzarella, and provolone cheeses all perfectly melted with fresh tomato and spinach.  I'm not completely sure about this, as it was not in the description of the item, but I swear there was pesto on this and it was heavenly.  The Panini came with a side order of fries which were seasoned nicely.  Total for this meal, $8.  For the size of the Panini itself (read that as big) it was well worth every penny.My one coworker decided to get the special of the day.  We ordered on a Friday which meant that you get 12 wings and a can of soda for $10.  That to me is a great deal.  These aren't those wing dings that other places try to pass off as wings, these were honest to goodness wings.  Lightly dusted and fried to perfection, or at least I think that's what my coworker was saying through a full mouth of food.Other things to check out here, pepperoni pizza, hush puppies and their BIG fish sandwich.  If you order wings other than the special they come with a side of fries as well.  Prices are great for the amount of food you get.  To say that it is filling is kind of an understatement.*Delivery available*"
"1.0","Don't order from this place! SCAM they gave me the wrong pizza. I called to ask if I could get the right one, they said no and hung up. Really???"
"1.0","Waited 20 minutes for to go hoagies. There was no meat all bread. Would have been good if they actually put steak on our cheesesteak. What a rip!!!"
"4.0","I was craving some Indian food tonight and didn't feel like spending too much money. After reading the reviews on yelp, I called Salem's to put in a take out order. For $14, I ordered a lamb curry, meat shwarma, garlic naan, and a baklava for my husband and I. These portions were generous and they did not skimp on the meat at all. I will be returning here for all my future Indian food cravings."
"5.0","Great little spot.  Not a lot of seating so not for large groups. The guy behind the counter, I wish I caught his name, was great!  He moved quick and took orders quickly he did not slow for a second till everyone was take care off.  The food was fantastic!  3 delicious tacos and a drink for 11 dollars!  It was a cheap and fun date night for us. I suggest walking down to the milk shake factory after for chocolate. It really topped the night off right for us!"
"4.0","This was a nice pick in Mount Washington, distant views on the city but open air inside due to 2 garage doors that rise to bring the outdoors in.  Attractive modern decor.  Nice beer selections, and lots of cocktails.  Solid neighborhood spot. Did not eat here, but I heard people saying good things."
"5.0","One of the best meals in Pittsburgh hands down. The service was excellent and the food was amazing. We started off with the bruschetta that was topped with bacon and tons of veggies the split the pork rassito(spelling) and split the eggplant pizza. I was shocked how delicious the eggplant pizza was, it was very good. The price of the food was very reasonable about 15-20 bucks a plate. The wine bottles were overpriced at 50 so we went with a glass of wine at 10 instead. I would highly recommend this place"
"4.0","The dining half of Salem's serves predominantly Indian food. The only Middle Eastern items are the meat and the chicken shawarma. I opted for the chicken shawarma sandwich which was about a foot-long and also filled with veggies and mustard. The mustard gave the sandwich an unusual yet interesting taste.I also tried the yogurt drink. As a warning, it is VERY salty. It's interesting to try but tough to finish unless you like salt...a lot.The market portion of Salem's has more items typical of Middle Eastern food. You'll find rice, pita, beans, and a myriad of sauces and spices characteristic of food from Arabia and South Asia. The largest part of the market is certainly the butcher's counter. (I'd like to clarify that Salem's has a butcher's counter not a deli counter). The meats are halal and priced comparable to Giant Eagle. They do sell a few deli meats but no where to the same scale at which they sell chicken, ground beef, goat, and other butchered meats."
"4.0","Visiting Pittsburgh for the first time and discovered The Summit on Yelp. We're not big on cocktails (which seem to be what they're best known for) but were tempted by the deviled eggs with pancetta and parmesan (because WTF is better than bacon & cheese?!) They did not disappoint, and neither did the pork dumplings or gouda mac & cheese!  The dumplings were different, the pork was almost like a meatball in flavor and texture... which I actually enjoyed more than a traditional dumpling. To cap it off I had the chicken tacos and my fiancé had the burger. I enjoyed the tacos but was too stuffed to finish them. The burger (though not medium rare as both suggested by our waitress and ordered) was delicious and 'one of the best he'd had in awhile.' Overall a great experience and our waitress Melissa was super friendly, attentive, and cool. I saw some reviews complaining about the price but we're from D.C. so it didn't seem expensive to us at all. We got all the food above plus two hard ciders for $65. Will definitely return if back in the area and recommend to others."
"5.0","I swung by this place after a meeting because I had never seen it before. Overall I was impressed. The wait wasn't long, the service was friendly, and I got my chicken & waffle to-go pretty fast. The vibe in the restaurant seemed pretty tight too. I got mine medium to try out their spicy levels and it would be just right for an average spicy chicken seeker. The waffles were pretty good and the combo itself was just too too good.I would also recommend getting their potato salad. It's beyond delicious with the chicken."
"2.0","Don't bother ordering extra toppings b/c you wont get more than enough to cover one slice only. The first time it happened I figured it was an oversight, but the second and third time it convinced me it was just their policy. If I ask for a pizza covered in ham, i'd like to see more than 7 little pieces of ham on it. There is nothing special about their pizza either. It's just typical American style pizza. Will not order from them anymore."
"5.0","Came here based on the reviews and OMG Pamela's did not disappoint! In a cute quaint area with nice shops all around & is a retro but contemporary feeling decor.  and the food was the BOMB.COM with super fast, friendly service."
"4.0","Food was superb!  Service was 'slightly slow' not with the food but afterwards getting the check."
"4.0","Loved it! I was not too excited about trying to eat healthy at an Italian joint, but went with friends. I was impressed at how many healthier options they had, if that's what you're in the mood for. Or pig out on a hot plate of carbs and dairy with a side of italian sausage.My friends and I split an order of beans, greens and tomatoes. I regret the sharing part, it was so outrageously delicious I wanted it all to myself. Next time I'm getting my own.In the spirit of healthy eating, I went with a salad, which was big, fresh, and just what I wanted. If you like salad, you're set. If not, the pasta my friends had looked great too. You can get gluten free or whole wheat pasta for an additional charge if you like. My boy friend had angel hair with alfredo, our friend had linguini marinara with fried calamari.The waitress was very pleasant, and kept her cool even though she had the pleasure of serving this merry band of drunk, vicious old queens.Now I would have been sold on the service and the food, everything I tasted was great. But the two pasta dishes weren't all that hot. Somewhat warmer than warm, they said. My friend let the waitress know but wasn't unhappy enough to send it back, even though the manager was adamant they could remake  the plate in no time. (I work in a customer based industry and I know first hand, nothing can be worse than an unhappy customer who isn't willing to let you fix the problem after they bring it to your attention.) So at the end of the meal, he offered to buy us a round of drinks instead. Smart guy - offer a couple of drunks some free liquor, and all is forgiven. He took an almost great meal and made it great for them. Sadly, I was driving so didn't take him up on the offer. So - great food, beans and greens, lots of choices, beans and greens, good service, and beans and greens. If it were closer to home I'd be ready to move in."
"5.0","I am so, so pleased with my experience here today. Three of us were walking around the Strip on a Saturday and we got pretty hungry around 1pm. I quickly pointed over across the street to this place since I've never been here. We walked in and were waiting on the hostess to seat us. I was looking around and most of the tables were full. Large TVs had march madness stuff going and orders were being delivered left and right. We waited not even five minutes to be seated, but the hostess appeared frazzled over so many people coming in.We were seated at a table in the back left. It was a spacious table with comfy chairs. Our waitress walked over within a few minutes and she was so quick to get our drinks. I got water and unsweetened iced tea. I looked over the menu and became way too excited for sushi. It's absolutely my favorite thing to eat so I was ready to order the whole menu. I narrowed it down to miso soup, seaweed salad, tuna & salmon sashimi. The two other people I was with ordered fish and chips, a burger, and an Alaskan roll. We chatted while we waited and I felt like our orders came out fairly quickly even though the place was busy. Also, I noticed how it wasn't insanely loud. A plus for sure. My unsweetened iced tea tasted strong and I liked that because most iced teas taste very watered down to me. Heidi, our waitress, brought over my miso soup and shortly after my sashimi and seaweed salad were delivered. Oh my gosh my sashimi was beautiful, fresh, and extremely delicious! The same goes for miso soup and seaweed salad, which was the tastiest I've had so far in Pittsburgh. I was head over heels for my food. I've finally found the sushi I've been dreaming of. Heidi was fabulous at keeping our drinks refilled and coming back to check on all of us. I liked that she didn't abandon us after getting us our orders.Towards the end of our meals, I decided I wanted to try a rainbow roll and asked if I could have it without rice. I wasn't trying to be a pain in the butt and I rarely ever ask for substitutions of any kind. Heidi said she'll see what she could do. She didn't say no and she didn't ignore my request. She put my order in and I was treated to an incredible modification with rainbow roll filling surrounded by a cucumber shell. It tasted amazing. I went over and praised/thanked the sushi chefs because they got creative and they provided excellent customer service. I thanked Heidi as well. She was so kind, bubbly, and an overall joy that added to our dining experience. We all adored her! Praise for the customer service, the food, and overall atmosphere. I was so happy and I'm definitely coming back for more of that sushi!"
"4.0","This is surprising nice. Great food, large menu, food allergy friendly, fair prices, and exceptional service.However, this restaurant is very large and is not a place for a low-key quiet meal. But that said, it is a nice option for a pre-show dinner."
"4.0","Excellent couscousProbably the only place in the 'burgh that offers it.  Available only on Friday.  A large piece of lamb with couscous and 3 or 4 boiled vegetables:  zucchini, squash, carrots, onions."
"5.0","Seriously the best place in Pittsburgh to get authentic Chinese food affordably..  Best egg rolls and homemade  duck sauce and hot mustard!  You will not regret eating here!  I will never go elsewhere again because I'm always disappointed when I waste the money and it's not half as good as this place!  Highly recommended!"
"2.0","Fun aesthetics with lots of seating and clearly quite popular, but I came in for a smoothie this morning and it took over 15 minutes. After a 10 minute wait I started peering over the counter and saw that they hadn't even started yet (mind you there wasn't anyone who ordered ahead of me and several people after me had gotten sandwiches and teas). I didn't say anything as they finally pulled out the blender. The blender struggled and a few minutes later they poured the smoothie contents out and then started trying to break up a chunk ice with a wooden spoon or something. Back in the blender to pulse what remained but it didn't work, as the smoothie I got had a huge mound of ice that blocked my straw at every sip. I know these guys do tea, but this was really disappointing between the wait, the ice, and lack of mango flavor in the mango smoothie."
"2.0","Went in for dinner on recent business trip. Tried the 'Taco night special', was informed it was a minimum of 4, so ordered although it didn't say that on menu. Tacos were small, very scant on filling, and pretty much flavorless.  Asked for hot sauce, Tabasco was only one available. Decided to try a cup of chili, as tacos weren't even close to filling. Chile tasted of green peppers and tabasco, no other flavors evident, near no meat either. Although door staff and waiter were very nice, I wouldn't recommend this place at all."
"5.0","Very good lunch buffet. Really worth for the money you pay. Very tasty. Lot of vegetarian options. Customer friendly. Great service. Simple menu but great taste and feels like home food."
"4.0","After following Umami through its many pop-up events, I am very excited that it is finally open!  Even more delightful is its wonderful, very authentic atmosphere. Upon entering, I immediately felt transported to a true Izakaya experience. Pittsburgh needs more authentic ethnic places like this!We had not made reservations, but we came at 9:40ish on a weeknight and were able to get seats at the kitchen-facing counter bar. The hostess was gracious, and we received impeccable service all night from our server Sheryl.  It was super fun to watch the chefs working. As someone who is obsessed with food and cooking in all forms and watches lots of shows/documentaries involving professional chefs, I was pleasantly surprised.  These chefs really know what they are doing.The hot towel they give you in the beginning is a really nice touch, and we enjoyed some cold sake with our meal. My partner got the tuna sashimi and the Nasu Shigiyaki and thought both were delicious. Apparently the Nasu Shigiyaki, which is half of a japanese eggplant pan-fried and topped with ground chicken and an incredibly delicious sauce, is a staff favorite.  Well, let me tell you, the staff have good taste. It is a dish that you might overlook on the menu, but it is awesome!  I was impressed.I got the ramen, and while it's one of the better bowls of ramen you can get in Pittsburgh, it was a bit on the salty side, the char siu was excessively fatty, and the bamboo shoots were uninspiring.  The egg was done perfectly, though.  Overall, I enjoyed the ramen at the Umami ramen pop-up a lot more, so this was the only (very slight) disappointment of the meal.We will definitely be returning to try some of the other food here!"
"3.0","I've always been a big fan of this place but lately I've kinda fell into a love hate type relationship. The shopping mart side is great and I love the fresh meats and how they cut everything right in front of you. Now as for the food court area it's been making me upset. I was here about two months ago and I got the rice and the tikka masala. As for the same thing today and both times have been bad. The flavor is invisible the chicken is so bland and it's just not there. It is disappointing to me because it use to be the best around and it makes me wanna stop coming because it seems the quality of the food has been downgraded. As for the rice it was normal basmati rice had good flavor. One thing that's really nice is they have two different baskets at the register. One has normal pita bread and the other has deep fried pita bread and I think it's awesome that's include free of charge. I really hope things change and go back to how it was before because I think this was one of the better middle eastern food spots in Pittsburgh."
"3.0","Alexander's is certainly a charming restaurant. It has a lovely patio and a nicely decorated inside (the bar in particular is the best feature. We arrived early, before the rest of our party, and decided to have a drink at the bar. The happy hour drink deals are pretty great, so we got a glass of Cabernet for $5 (and BOY was it a heavy pour!). The bar tender was nice as can be, helped us choose our wine, and even brought out little crunchy snacks for us to eat with our drinks. Our party arrived and we sat at our table in the bar section (happy hour deals still apply in this section!). Bread is immediately brought out along with two types of olive oil and cups of grated Parmesan cheese. The pesto-infused oil is tasty, especially mixed with some parm, but honestly the parm is almost tasteless, and the bread is a crusty, thickly cut, white bread that's just not that great. It was also served with butter packets which are just a bit tacky for me. We ordered two appetizers for the table: the 'greens and beans' and the 'fried zucchini.' The greens and beans are absolutely delicious (garlic, white beans, spinach, tomatoes, olive oil). The fried zucchini was nondescript and the marinara that came with it was bland. For my main course I ordered the tortellini with the Gorgonzola cream sauce with broccoli. The portions are huge, so you'll definitely have leftovers (no complaints). The broccoli was underdone, however, which was disappointing. The sauce was also quite bland, which was surprising considering the base should be Gorgonzola cheese. So I had to douse it in hot pepper flakes to give it a real taste.The manager is extremely welcoming and kind, always ready to be on the floor greeting and making sure things are ok; he's a great guy and is genuinely trying to better the place. When a friend of mine sent his dish to be boxed, however, it was thrown away instead because someone in the back thought it was overdone and assumed my friend wouldn't want it. We were told after the fact that it was thrown away and taken off the bill. Honestly it should have been spotted immediately if it was overdone, and not thrown away without asking the customer.. That was a disappointment. I will be back, because I'm truly rooting for this restaurant, but I hope that next time I'll see some changes (bread, please!)."
"5.0","There's a million places for tacos... Is kinda annoying.  Regardless, this place is the only place that I go for tacos. Why? Because the tacos are simply the best. No fancy bullshit foofoo tacos here. Simple fresh delicious. And they are cheap. Like tacos should be.  No $12 tacos here.  They are 3 bones each.  My favorite is the chicken ones. But they are all good. And sometimes they have featured flavors. Those are always great.  There's sometimes a line. Don't be deterred...it usually goes fast. Don't expect to find a seat if they were busy though."
"3.0","Mmm tacos :) I'm currently on the hunt to find the best taco places in Pittsburgh and I was really excited when I found this place on Yelp. Sadly this place probably wouldn't make it on the top 5. The restaurant itself is very cute but also very small. Don't plan on eating here if you have a big group or it's prime lunch/dinner hours. This establishment is more of a order and go place.As for the tacos they do a specialty taco that changes daily I believe. You can follow their Instagram account to keep up with the daily options. This was probably one of my favorite aspects. Otherwise they just offer a handful of basic tacos that aren't out of the ordinary in any way. The specialty tacos is what makes me want to go back again and again to try the different tacos. I will say I wasn't all that impressed with the flavor of the tacos. I think they lacked flavor."

"5.0","In short, Thai Gourmet has fantastically flavorful food for a good price (for what you get). Others here have said it more eloquently than I, so I'm just here to echo their sentiments.The take-out portions are very generous and have definitely supplied me with plentiful leftovers. One of my personal favorites is the Tom Kar soup as I'm a big fan of coconut milk, but nothing I've eaten from Thai Gourmet has disappointed me. It's absolutely some of the best Thai food I have ever had, and is highly recommended."
"2.0","I really, really wanted to love this place but it left me wanting much more. I stopped in for breakfast and got a smoothie and a breakfast burrito - neither had much flavor. The smoothie was really somewhat tasteless which was odd because it had a handful of ingredients. Kind of like how la croix sort of tastes like fruit. The Southwest burrito was almost there but needed something to pull it altogether. The eggs were sitting around or microwaved (sort of tasted like liquid egg or powdered egg), but either way were not made to order. Healthy food can be incredibly flavorful but both of these items just missed the mark. Staff was friendly but they seemed a little distracted by the catering order they were working on - I was the only person in there and it took around 5 min before they even started on the smoothie."
"5.0","GOD DAMN this chickens good. but GOD DAMN this chickens hot. I got MEDIUM and I needed to be placed in a milk bath for 3 hours. The mac and cheese and french fries were delicious! Too bad after I ate a bite or two of the chicken, my tastebuds left my mouth for good -- probably would've enjoyed if more. Overall, delicious food! WILL be returning... this time for less spicy chicken."
"5.0","I love this market because it's so convenient for us who live in Lawrenceville. They have so many options and phenomenal hours. The food is always fairly priced, and the staff is extremely friendly. If they were somehow able to start doing coffee/lattes as well, that would be a dream... Love supporting Lawrencevilles small businesses!"
"3.0","Pamela's is a classic brunch staple in Pittsburgh. I have many memories here from my college days, and it always brings back great memories when I dine here. After traveling around a bit and living in NYC, I admit I have been spoiled. In college, Pamela's was the best brunch thing to me, but now I've gotten pickier. The hot cakes are great as everyone had mentioned. It's a cross between a pancake and a crepe, but leans more towards the latter. I got the Banana Walnut Hotcake, and it definitely hit the spot. I also tried the Tex Mex Omelette, which was tasty as well. It had a little bit of heat, and the side potatoes were good too.Overall, a solid, safe bet for brunch. Be sure to get there early, as the dining room fills up quickly. Cash only (PNC ATM is across the street). They also grossly underestimate the wait times when I went on busy Sunday mornings."
"5.0","Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. This place is tiny. I usually don't like that, but for whatever reason it didn't seem like that much of a problem. Me and some girlfriends were here on a Friday night to grab some chow before heading over to a game night. I loved the decor, and the cooks were both very friendly and personable. They had most everything ready to go in steam trays so they can throw together orders quickly, but don't let that deceive you into thinking the food isn't delicious. We shared some veggie nachos that were delish and only $4 for a big container. I got two pork tacos and one spicy beef. The pork was super legit, moist, and the toppings were the bomb diggity. I also liked the spicy beef, which is interesting because I usually don't go for beef tacos. I was bummed to not see chorizo on the menu, but I was told they have a daily special taco and they sometimes feature the chorizo. Tacos were $3/per, and drinks from the cooler were all the old school cane sugar ones and Jarritos for only $2 each. This place stays open til 3am on the weekends to accommodate the drunk Southside crowd, and is thankfully NOT cash only.Great addition to the dope little food joints in the Southside. One of the cooks told me they plan on expanding into the space next door, but I sort of don't want anything to change because it's pretty amazing as is."
"5.0","I love the Wheelhouse. By far the best restaurant in the Rivers casino. They have such a wide variety on the menu & the portions are HUGE. I've eaten here several times & always have leftovers. Portions are definitely large enough to share. The meatloaf dinner is one of my favorites. It's cooked perfectly & you get two sides PLUS soup or salad. Can't beat that for $17! Wheelhouse also have a decent French dip. Service is usually pretty quick and the staff is friendly. Their wedding soup is also really good and you can't go wrong with one of the salads. I'd definitely recommend the wheelhouse!"
"5.0","Lunch at Salem's is excellent.  I have always got my fix of authentic arab/mediteranian food from their original location in Oakland.  This location is MUCH,  MUCH better!   There is parking.   It is impecably clean.   The space is huge.   The food is more varied and tastes great!  The service is way above any cafetria syle restaurant!   It is definately a place that makes you feel like you belong.....no matter who you are!If you like mediteranian, indian-style food....you have to try it here.   It tastes great, feels real, and is inexpensive!"
"5.0","Went on a Saturday before the rush, and had an amazing meal in an atmosphere best described as casually cool.  Our server was quick to respond and knew the menu back to front.  She brought out a macaroni and cheese appetizer that was fierce!  Cheesy, springy, zesty and DELISH!!!!  Our main courses were the shadyside and the polish hill burgers surrounded in a sea of crispy french fries.  My rosemary fries were UNREAL.  The burgers are a thin seasoned patty, topped generously.  Make sure you order a chocolate shake for the trip home...it's made with Millie's local ice cream, you'll thank me later.The bar and tabletops are made from local trees acquired in Butler.  Everything in the whole place is local, from the meat to the toppings to the glasses you drink out of.  Hell, even the bathroom screams Pittsburgh....FOR EVERYONE ON YELP THAT WANTS A 6 DOLLAR BURGER AND THINKS THAT A POOR REVIEW IS WARRANTED FOR YOUR WALLET BEING UPSET, GO TO EAT N PARK.  I think Hardee's also has a cheap dirty meat wad you can shove down your pie hole."
"1.0","straight d*ck team. only reason they did not receive one star is well one, that is not an option, and two, the delivery was quick. (im only 6 blocks down the street though.) got the grilled chicken salad which was 90% fries and cheese. got about 3 bite sized pieces of chicken and maybe 4 bites of lettuce. the pizza was absolutely just sub par. my stomach has been killing me for almost two days. wow."
"4.0","We came here on a Saturday night, where there was only one server on duty. But she was attentive. The place has a great ambiance. We really liked our food. I had the best whiskey sour I've had in a long time. We'll be back!PS There are games available for the customers!"
"1.0","Food is ok, but service is bad. And then plenty of empty tables and they still let us sit in the bar."
"1.0","I ordered a pizza at 12:30 am and it did not arrive until 2:00 am.  I was never contacted about a delay with my order.  I made an attempt to contact the establishment but I was sent straight to voicemail multiple times even though I called before their supposed closing hours.  The pizza was average and very poorly cut not pleasing to the eye whatsoever.  I do appreciate the fact the pizza arrived at all but I'm still upset."
"5.0","Great place to watch sports.  Will show just about any game.  Great bar food selection as well.   Yum yum.  Vast beer selection.  So you will be comfortable and have a good time.  Not to loud either.  Enjoy one and then another."
"1.0","The worst pizza I have ever had in Pittsburgh. Crust was doughy, cheese tasted horrible, and the sauce was so minimal it was basically non existent. I'm actually impressed on how they managed to make a pizza taste so bad. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. You'd be better off getting a pizza from literally anywhere else in the city of Pittsburgh."
"1.0","I placed a delivery order today, and it took nearly two hours for the delivery. They offered no discount for the inconvenience. I will not order from them again."
"5.0","If I could go here every day I would. The pork and shrimp shumai is my absolute favorite. Typically when a group of us go we need at least a couple orders of it. The the pork belly robata is also a favorite of mine, and really I could go on and on listing the items I love at Umami. Not to mention the atmosphere is excellent. They have a DJ there most nights.The only downside I'd have to say is that it is a bit of work to get there as it sits above Cantina. It's not the easiest to find and lots of stairs."
"5.0","Delicious food and excellent service at a great price. It may not look like much when you go in, but do not be fooled. The vibe is so great in here with all sorts of people mixing together during the lunch rush. If the variety of foods seems overwhelming, take a friend, read some reviews, and bring an open mind to try a few things. Maybe things that look familiar!My husband and I went and decided to split some menu items so I could try a variety of things. I really enjoyed the hot bar offerings. We had chicken tikka masala, spinach paneer, and chickpeas. The generous cuts of chicken were moist and served over rice in a slightly spicy sauce. This combination is definitely a filling lunch for one.The naan shawarma should not be missed as well. It takes a bit longer than the items above since it comes from the grill, but they give you a number and bring it over. The shawarma sandwich is served on nann bread with garlic sauce, Mediterranean pickles and onions. The naan had a subtle garlic flavor which left me wanting more naan for sure! If you like gyros, give this a try sometime - very similar. Fries, are another must at this place too if you're a fan of perfect french fries.Plan ahead for parking, the small lot nearby fills up quick but there's always street parking."
"4.0","Cool vibe definitely. I think the tacos could be a little better however, I'm sure after a long drunken night- these tacos would taste amazing. I will update my review once I stumble in here again after a fun night out."
"4.0","Rialto is my go-to place for pizza in the East End of Pittsburgh. I love the options at Rialto: pizza to sandwiches to salads to appetizers to desserts and more. The food is high-quality and the service is always prompt and polite. On a recent visit I ordered the tossed salad (cuz veggies are important). I was pleasantly surprised to find that this wasn't the standard pizzeria salad (ie iceburg lettuce with whole black olives). The lettuce was crisp and fresh (a nice green leaf lettuce) with peppers, cheese and a breadstick. We ordered a small personal pan for the kiddo and a Sicilian pizza for ourselves. The Sicilian was great - a great crust with a perfectly seasoned sauce. Here are a few of my tips:- Come for the pizza, stay for the rest. The menu is big and everything is good. Why not get something in addition to your pizza?- Rialto's has a surprisingly great beer selection. Bring your ID, cuz pizza and beer are fantastic. - Leave a few minutes early if you are picking up. Parking is limited. - Get the pirogi pizza. Its amazing! Why should I even have to tell you this?"
"4.0","Great place to stop in for happy hour downtown! They have different specials each day and great daily specials. It was $4 house wines the day I was there. I haven't eaten here yet, but am intrigued by some of their daily food specials like All You Can Eat Crab Legs on Mondays! There is plenty of seating at the bar and the bartenders have always been great. Convenient location to the North Shore and Cultural District."
"5.0","YUM! The people here were very friendly while we ordered our tacos, and the massive range of vegetarian options is fab! Instead of just one veggie taco option (like beans and cheese) they had a soyrizo option to compliment the omnivorous chorizo taco.SOYrizo. Get it? It was quite good.These tacos are super messy, so don't trick yourself into thinking you can eat and drive with these guys... take a seat nearby and enjoy!"
"5.0","We recently dined here as part of Pittsburgh's restaurant week special. I had actually been recommended to come here for a while, and we figured that we would take advantage of the deal. This restaurant was fantastic! They have a very nice selection of wines, and we began our dinner with the New England clam chowder. Our waiter was exceptional, tolerating my boyfriend's bad dad jokes all night. Our soup was followed by the main course. We both ordered steaks. I ordered an 8oz filet mignon, topped with crab oscar, and he ordered a 14oz NY strip with a side of lobster tail. The steaks were cooked perfectly, and tasted amazing. Interestingly, the lobster tail had already been stripped from the actual shell of the lobster, so we were presented with just the meat and butter. It was a different way to present. Our food was fantastic. Both entrees included a side of mashed potatoes and green beans, which we barely touched because we were so focused on the entrees before us. We ended up taking some of the food home, which means left overs!The meal ended with dessert. I ordered a cheesecake, while he ordered an espresso chocolate cake. I think I made the better decision, for sure. Overall, the food was fantastic. The restaurant was incredibly busy for a Monday night, likely due to the special, so reservations are a must! That being said, we still got ample attention and service, and our meal was wonderful. We had a fantastic night, and will be sure to dine again, this time with the full menu."
"1.0","I was a regular patron here for the last two years or so, whenever they opened. I enjoyed the teas and the sandwiches even tho ordering usually was more difficult and time consuming than it should have been. Most recently however, I ordered a Matcha--it has a little red asteric that denotes it is a 'master tea'. ~Nothing on the board (that takes up About 6ftx6ft) says that master teas are priced differently or cost more than all the other blends or speciality drinks.~ So when I look at the total on the register and it's higher than what the board said, I asked why it was $4.50 as opposed to $4.25, sure it's only a quarter, but it's also the difference in sizes also. I immediately received backlash from the man at the counter, saying that 'match is different so it's more'. The man must have said this like 5 times as he grew more upset. He told me 'it has a asteric, that means it's a different price, we can't put all the prices up on the board bc it's too much info', to which I replied 'the asteric denotes it's a master tea, but doesn't say its subject to different pricing.' He stayed on his high horse, telling me 'it's matcha, it's different' mixed with 'it's not gonna change, it's 4.50, it's special'.then the lady who owns the place ( I think) comes up to the front and accuses me of ASKING ABOUT THE PRICE OF THE MATCHA BEFORE AND CAUSING A SCENE. To which I replied that I don't usually drink Matcha and was getting it for a friend, and it wasn't me...but if multiple people are questioning your prices THAT ARE NOT ADVERTISED PROPERLY, it's probably time to post the correct prices, bc it's false advertisement to charge more for something than you have advertised. I was baffled at this customer service and feeling like I was being publicly shamed for inquiring about a price... They are screaming at me at this point and I'm ready to leave, and the man looks at me and says 'you are NEVER allowed to be served here again!!'I've been frequenting this place for years! I can't believe the treatment I received for questioning a price and then was publicly humiliated when they were in the wrong in the first place. Mind blowing and they banned one customer and lost at least two more regular customers--and it's a shame, because we are only 2 blocks away and I'm a tea head and I need tea!!!"
"5.0","Tamarind is located in the first floor of a converted house and has a nice casual atmosphere. The service is polite and efficient and the restaurant is very clean and airy. The regular menu features the standard North Indian curries and a smaller selection of South Indian dosas. They have a very nice dal. The weekday lunch buffet is also very good and is vegetarian friendly. The weekend buffet, which costs a dollar more, is better tailored for omnivores (unlimited chicken 65 and mango lassi!!!!). Parking is easy to find on Craig, although meters can be expensive."
"2.0","Went for brunch/lunchtime. Immediately was pleased by the ambiance, very cute interior and friendly staff. However, pretty much everything else was disappointing to awful.The waitress gave us plastic bottled water when we sat down then asked us if we wanted drinks (we ordered iced tea and iced coffee). The drinks smelled and tasted off, indicating there is something wrong with the water. When we asked about it at the end of our meal after we got the check the waitress sort of played dumb about the water and then said she'd get the manager. We didn't stick around to talk to the manager because we were already put off by the whole experience. I didn't realize until scrolling through their yelp reviews that they charge 50 cents for the water bottles (no mention of that in the conversation with either waitress who helped us). Just really weird and kind of shady.The food was really disappointing as well. Avocado toast in my mind doesn't mean prepackaged guacamole and a cold fried egg. The bread used for both the avo toast and the French toast was terrible. Wouldn't go back after our first experience there."
"5.0","Excellent crepes French toast and coffeeGreat service from Eto and ConnerNice lunch patioWould highly recommend"
"2.0","I had to try this new place. When I walked in, first first impression was how clean, open, and, new the place looked. I really liked the wooden table tops, they were beautiful. I appreciated the wheel chair accessibility to the second level, and that the floor was offset with to tiers as it was. I liked the open, high ceilings and industrial look of the place. The design is very modern. The only negative critique I have is how noisy it was. The tables were only about a third capacity and I imagine the noise only getting worse with more being served.Service was good, I was seated immediately, no wait. The waitress did an ok job, but, didn't do anything to be welcoming or introduce anything about the place it the menu. With it being new I kind of expected more from the wait staff.The food was ok. I had the rosemary fries, they were seasoned well, didn't need anything added, they had a nice crunch to them, tasted fresh, and, I'd have them again. I had the Pitts burger. The portion was very very small for the price. I requested rare but got medium well instead. You can see that in the photo I'll add.Overall, I think they have some work to do. Such as something to decrease the noise; curtains, drapes, cloth to catch the echo. And either the portion has to go up or the price come down, but, the hamburger was worth a third of the tab. I was left asking, 'where's the beef'. Again, look at the photo. I will try and give them a second chance in a month or so."
"5.0","We tried this place on a whim because there was a great groupon available and I'm so glad we discovered it. We had $50 worth of food to get with the groupon deal so we had a ton of food and could sample different menu items to compare to our usual spot (India Garden in Monroeville) I have to say this place came out slightly ahead. The mango Lassis here were definitely better- fantastic flavor and consistency. We also tried different kinds of naan and both were delicious. So we're the chicken samosas! Super flavorful. As for the main dishes- I had chicken korma, my go-to favorite. It was excellent. I had a medium spice level and I'm someone who loves super spicy food. Medium is PLENTY spicy!! So keep that in mind maybe. My boyfriend had butter chicken, mild and it was also excellent!! Both will be re-ordered! The service was great- everyone was so friendly and attentive. We even got little donuts for free as dessert. Whether you're a fan of Indian food or just want to try it- come here! And check groupon!"
"5.0","Just tried cafe Raymond.  Good place.  Everyone seemed a bit confused abt drink responsibilities, but once my son said; 'it's like Taco Bell' then I got it.  Food was good, plenty to eat and will come here again"
"1.0","The food tastes good. The service is worst. I would give it a one star just for the food. One of the worst services I have ever had. Definitely not recommended"
"5.0","This restaurant is a gem!Parking was easy to find on a side street next to the restaurant.We were greeting as soon as we walked in and the host say is immediately-impressive for 6:30 on a Friday evening.We ordered the fried zucchini, which came with marinara sauce. Absolutely amazing!! Best marinara I've ever eaten.There is a page in the menu of mix-and-match pastas with sauces. I got the tortellini with pesto and my mother got the gnocchi with red pepper sauce. The pesto was more like an Alfredo sauce with pesto in it. Although not what I expected, it was amazing. The red pepper sauce was sweet and tangy, a little different but still very enjoyable.All of the courses came out quickly- we were there for less than an hour. Our waiter was very nice and frequently refilled our waters.Overall, amazing experience and I will be returning next time I am in Pittsburgh."
"5.0","First time in and the food did not disappoint.  Everything is made homemade and wonderfully yummy!"
"5.0","Only the best taco stand in the burgh. There's actually a few great Mexican restaurants in the city but this taco stand is UN. REAL. In fact, if you have ever been to California and had tacos in LA or San Diego than this will be an exact experience. These ARE LA tacos. I recommend the carnitas."
"5.0","Shwarma's are unbelievable and the staff is awesome. They're generous about letting you try their food and are very friendly. Great value for awesome food.I've been there 4-5 times and the food has been consistently great. Meat is always good quality and tender while other ingredients seem fresh."
"2.0","It is impressive to have Thai food this bland.  I do not have any understanding of what other people on this page could possibly be experiencing.Go to Thai Cuisine.  Or if it is Monday and they are closed, Smiling Banana Leaf."

"4.0","Pretty decent breakfast. I had the Tex mex omelette which was delicious. I substituted the chorizo for turkey sausage - YUM! The breakfast potatoes were also delicious. Luckily when I went, it wasn't packed but it did start getting busy once I was leaving. I can see how this place can sometimes have a bit of a wait. Also don't forget to bring cash, CASH ONLY!"
"5.0","I think THE best Chinese food restaurant that I ever been to. Portions are large (at least for dinner), food taste great, service is nice. Also they serve you complimentary tea with food. I would highly recommend it and will make a visit soon again."
"5.0","Wow. From the coffee to the Green Apple , Brie and Fig Challah French toast and the meat filled omelet my wife got everything was fresh and fantastic"

"1.0","Omg we came here for a quick lunch today the wings were so bad I nearly gagged . Salads were bad too ... how is that even possible"
"4.0","We have dined here many times and brought a guest this time. The atmosphere in the main dining room is very nice as in a warm gentleman's clubby room kind of way. There are great paintings on all the walls including a great one of Mr. Rogers and there are several mounted animal heads high-up on some walls.  Their bread and the selection is very good including the pumpernickel and lavash. They serve butter that is some the best you can get. 'European-style' Cultured Butter I would say.From the Bar we ordered a Grey Goose martini with blue cheese stuffed olives perfectly made and the olives were some of the best I have had. The apple martini was weak for some reason but had good taste. With dinner a bottle of Concha y Toro, Marques Casa de Concha 2010 Carmenere went so well with our steaks.To start I had the Wedge salad that was pretty good for sure right up there with some of the best. The lettuce was appropriately extremely cold and crisp. While the blue cheese dressing was good indeed, it could have been a little stronger of the blue for my own taste, but the tomato wedges and the bacon were outstanding. The Onion soup was tasty with a great topping of oozy melted crusty cheese.  We also had Wagyu Beef Carpaccio that I would grade outstanding.Specials of the night are always worth a review and discussion with your server. Tonight, one that sounded great was a preparation of wild pacific salmon, but we were here for the steaks tonight.My dry age strip steak was a very flavorful piece of meat and the tenderloin with porcini sauce and the poached lobster was a super combination, tender and flavorful, decadent perhaps; just great . The filet that we asked to be treated with the Kona was very good. Also at our table we had he porterhouse which was a good size, nicely done and very tasty. To reiterate a bit, we enjoyed good flavor with all the steaks and all were prepared as ordered.Service, first and last was outstanding. Our server's knowledge was just short of encyclopedic. Everything about everything on their menu and anything about all the food and perpetrations she was able to recite.  She was very professional, fast and prompt in an apparent effortless and smooth manner. Wine she knew all about, yes she did. 'Oh I think you would want that wine filtered', so she decanted our wine as her own recommendation for what we had. 'Not going to finish the wine; want it back in the bottle', not a problem and immediately it was done. They are very busy on the weekends and when we arrived for our 8PM reservation the dining rooms were at 95 percent full. If you arrive without a reservation you might have a chance to eat in the lounge area high tops, bar, or the few tables in the area. If you like great dining and great steak and can afford an upscale price; Capital Grill is worth the occasional experience."
"5.0","My friend had her baby shower in a private space here and it was amazing! The food was delicious and the space was comfy and classy! Be careful with parking around this location but other than that we enjoyed our time here!"
"3.0","Th food always taste fresh. The portions seem small but by time you're finished it's the perfect amount of full. I suggest the Maggie farmhouse burger. There's usually some kinda deal on Groupon for this place, which I do not understand but I am not complaining. Do not get the Mac n cheese, unless you plan on using it to mortar a brick house. The salads are delicious. The chicken also is very good crispy and lite"
"5.0","I'm a huge fan of Salem's, esp. with the opening of this new space. The restaurant, as someone else said, looks like a cafeteria but it's bright, clean and simple. The staff are courteous and service is fast.The food is great. Pretty decent spread of offerings from shish kabobs to tandoori's to schwarma (gyro). Naans, lassi's, mango drinks, pop also on offer. I prefer to stick with the schwarma myself and it always delivers.As for the market side, this is one of the best butchers in Pittsburgh - lamb, beef, steaks, chicken, goat at reasonable prices. I'm not strict about halal/kosher but I buy from here because I know the quality is good."
"4.0","We order delivery often and the service is always prompt and we love the pizza. And they take credit cards!"
"3.0","The food was good, however, the service made a giant difference in the experience. I was with a party of 7 so I expected a slower service. When a table of 4 left bc they were not asked for drink a drink order after 30 minutes it meant something. It took at least 20 minutes to get our first drink from order to the table. I feel they needed more service staff as one girl did the entire place. She did great, but they need to re-evaluate service staff levels."
"5.0","Despite the bad reviews I read, I decided to go ahead and give this place a try. Needless to say, I was not disappointed! The pizza has a sauce that is irresistible and the dough is lighter than a layer of fillo dough. The steak hoagie could have done better with some more cheese, but I'm not complaining!"
"4.0","My friend and I came here to walk the strip and get some brunch on a Friday. She got the egg and cheese croissant which came with home fries, and I got the meal that came with breakfast meat, eggs, and one blueberry ricotta pancake. That was the ticket item everyone said to try but I'm usually more of a savory breakfast person over sweet. So the meal I got was perfect for someone wanting a little of each! Mine also came with home fries, though I don't think that was listed on the menu. Surprise potatoes with my meal? Always a plus!I enjoyed the pancake a lot, the ricotta definitely made it a softer, more gooey consistency and a little less sweet. I don't know how many scrambled eggs they gave me but it was a lot. When I ordered she asked if I wanted cheese and I said sure and they put two slices of cheddar on top of my pile of eggs. Too much for me, and I'm a cheese lover. Bacon was perfect and crispy and home fries were good with some nice seasoning. I left potatoes and eggs in my plate because I was full. My friend took half of her croissant sandwich to go also as she was full, it was huuuuge. The croissant looked fresh and flaky and she said it was delicious. Would go back! I can see this getting very busy on weekends though, small place so go early!"
"3.0","This place used to be the only fine dining establishment in good 'ol Bloomfield.  I've been here a few times.  Apparently the food has booze in it, because I can't even remember what I ordered.  I don't remember being disappointed.  But yeah...I think this suffers a bit from the lack of uniqueness.  Now, overly unique can be just as damning of a quality as unoriginal, but forgettable may be the worst quality a restaurant can have.  I do remember relatively slow and subpar service last time I was there, even though we were the only party there.  Our waitress was texting with the vigor of a middle school student whose parents didn't quite pay attention to them enough (because Dad had to work long hours and now it's time to passive aggressively stick it to him by dating a 17 year old 'bad boy' with an abnormal amount of facial hair).  Anyways, they'll have to do something if they wanna stay relevant.  IF THIS RESTAURANT WERE A MUSICIAN/BAND: Grand Funk Railroad:  You can't remember anything they ever did, and you never will have a strong opinion about them, despite not having any sort of strong reputation as good or bad.  You only know they existed."
"1.0","We wanted to go to this bar on a Sunday before the kevin hart show. We made reservations a week before for 5 people. When we got there they had no idea where to put us. They said the upstairs was closed... But then asked if we wanted to go up there? We got upstairs and we were the only people in the room. We went at 3 to watch the game and it wasn't on one of the tvs with sound! They were watching ice skating. IT WAS THE LAST TWO GAMES BEFORE THE SUPERBOWL! We went there because it was supposed to be a sports grill. Once situated, we realized the vent above our table was blowing freezing cold air. We asked the bartender at least 3 times to please fix it. The waitress was horrible. Very poor service! Couldn't believe how long it took her to serve us when we were the only people in the restaurant. She brought us waters and then came back and asked if we needed waters? Literally within 10 minutes.  Two of us didn't even drink our waters yet. Our alcoholic drinks took forever. The food was cold and not worth it at all. We had more people join us and we barely saw a waitress. When she did come over she would walk past the table and not say a word.  WE NEVER EVEN RECEIVED HER NAME! She never once smiled. We complained to the manager and he told us they never realized they would be so busy? But for the first three hours, there was only us and two other tables? Her service was poor the entire time. We finally decided to leave... Our waitress put totally wrong drinks on our bill. Then we walked outside and were FOLLOWED BY THE MANAGER AND SERVER. YELLING AT US THAT WE DIDNT PAY ONE OF OUR BILLS! Totally embaressing. We all paid our bills and would never leave without paying. No matter how bad it was. The guy we were with, went to the bar to pay his bill. When they walked back into the restaurant to confirm that he paid the bartender said she never swiped his card!!! Like what the hell? Why would you take someones card.... Hand it back and never do the transaction? We will NEVER go here again. Totally ridiculous. Don't waste your money."
"2.0","I never write a review until I leave but this place has me a bit upset. When I walk in the guy say you should sit at the bar but oh you can sit anywhere but the bar is best. Ok I take it I need to sit at the bar. So I order food. Just 10 wings. They bring me only 9. Yep I'm at bit pissed off. I pay for 10 I'd like to have 10. If I ever return to Pittsburg I don't think I'd come back. Service is like 90 percent of the dining experience. When I told my bartender she just blew it off. I guess because they are by the baseball field they can do whatever! I'm so not happy! I also order tequilla Dobel $15 when I have gotten it for $4. Stick to beer. $3.75-7.00For those who care or dare to try-maybe you'll have a better experience than me-the wings are good, all 9 if them."
"4.0","Food - the sampler starter  had 6 raw oysters that were mediocre fresh and some jumbo shrimp that was delicious. The seafood pasta entrée (i think the most expensive on the menu) was awesome! They overflowed the plate with all kinds of different seafood and didn't go too heavy on the noodles. The blackened shrimp and scallops were just ok. The sauce on the rice was too sweet for my taste. Service - I think the host might be Luke himself. He was very accommodating and checked in on us a few times. Our server was very friendly. I kept ordering beer that they were out of so they gave me a bunch of tasters. The bartender actually came to the table to better understand my beer taste so he can recommend the right beer for me.I would definitely go back but will probably just stick to the seafood pasta. They say it's for 1 person but it's really large enough for 2. Maybe get an appetizer and the pasta to share for 2 people."
"5.0","Just ordered takeout from the Chinatown Inn and the food is absolutely AMAZING!! Delivered hot, fresh, flavourful, an absolute delight. I ordered the General Tso Chicken with fried rice and egg rolls. Delivered to my hotel is under 20 minutes. Would have walked to the restaurant, but it was raining, but the good thing is that delivery is a very good option. I would totally recommended this establishment. LOVE IT!!!"
"5.0","One of my favorite no frills restaurant-you get a huge portion of delicious food for an amazing price. My standards for Indian food are incredibly high, and Salem's meets them and then some. The Indian food, middle eastern food, pastries, and all the other foods I've tried here have been good. The tandoori chicken is juicy and flavorful, and the marinade is perfectly distributed. It tastes especially spectacular with the creamy garlic sauce they give you. The seekh kabob is amazing as well, again juicy with the perfect amount of spices mixed in. The green sauce that comes with it is light and refreshing and pairs perfectly with it. My dad got the regular meal with spinach, chicken curry, and goat curry along with the side salad and rice (a LOT of food for $8.99). The spinach is delicious and a little bit creamy. The chicken curry was good but not as incredible as the other two chicken dishes we had, and though I'm not a fan of goat, my dad LOVED the goat curry. All in all, an amazing eat that's easy on your wallet and leaves you with yummy leftovers."
"5.0","This is a wonderfully operated family run and owned gem off Centre Ave. The food is delicious. They always have a special which is delicious. The cookies and pastry display has had only good things to offer that I have found. The cupcakes are incredible. Cool flavored coffee's I have yet to try the ice cream but I'm sure that's good too. It's also really well decorated. Very nice atmosphere."
"5.0","I love this place. It's our go to spot for a quick lunch at work. I highly recommend pretty much everything.  The chicken burger is my favorite and I avoid eating the massive quantity of rice that is served with the options on the hot bar."
"3.0","Tried them for lunch on Friday.The service is great. Very friendly staff and quick.I ordered a Mt. Washington sandwich. It was tasty but it had quite a bit of slaw on it. I felt like it could have had more meat for the price.I also ordered a macaroni salad. It was also tasty but was a bit on the wet side for me. All in all, I'd visit again in a pinch, but I think there are other places that provide a better value for lunch downtown."
"3.0","It's a decent spot to grab some food if you're up on the north side. I'd prefer another place. Food is kind of greasy. I asked for a side of steamed broccoli and it was covered in butter. If you're trying to keep it healthy I'd skip this place. Decent sandwiches and burgers though."
"5.0","We came in from Cleveland and stopped up here based on recommendations of Pittsburgh locals that visited Cleveland. At first we saw a huge line out the door and we deterred but we realized that the levels function as separate entities in a way and that we could head right upstairs and snag bar stools. We did! We ordered a couple beers and were very impressed with the selection, I loved that they had Peach Dodo on nitro, it was so delicious! We also ordered the crab dip which was super good! The woman next to us tried to order something from the downstairs menu and was very confused as to why it was not a possibility, that goes back to what i mentioned earlier about them functioning as separate entities, each floor has their own menu and can only honor their menu! On the top floor it is a limited bar menu, but the options all looked and sounded great. Again I recommend the crab dip, soooo good! We also would like to recognize Andrea, she was our main bartender and we really enjoyed her. Even though it was non-stop busy she was fun and entertaining and so sweet! When we left the bar for a moment to admire the over the roof view she brought us our phones because she didn't want them to get stolen, that was very considerate. She is an all-star! Definitely worth checking out and we hope to stop in again next time we are in town, I would like to see how it looks when the rooftop is up!"
"5.0","Love this downtown lunch spot! The service was amazing and the young gentleman helped me so much and was very happy to be at work. He even remembered some regulars first name. Great customer service! The food was also delicious with great salads and burritos. There is also a really neat coffee shop inside too!"
"3.0","We are not Muslim so this place was previously out of our sights, but my daughter's friend recommended this place to us so we gave it a shot. Parked nearby and entered. Line was long but moved quickly. I got the lamb curry, the staff were all friendly and professional and the food was done quickly. I thought it would be a small sit down restaurant with menus etc, but this place is like a one-store food court - lots of tables, row of counters up front, order up front then take your food back with you or they promptly deliver certain foods. We found a table and dug in. The Chili chicken was good. My lamb curry was fair, kind of dry and there was a lot of rice. Not too spicy. However, I didn't realize that the food came in little styrofoam boxes and they are packed to the brim, so in general, it was a little too messy for me. Also, they are served with or on the bone and with plastic utensils, which complicated eating them. Naan was delicious and easy water refills were a plus. I guess in general, this place seemed like a tight and heavily ethnic restaurant so it was a little confusing and different for us. I'm sure that it is a great place if you grew up with that type of food and culture, and I'm glad we tried it."
"2.0","This place is nostalgic, but not great. Reheated pizza, off-brand chips,  things heated on a small rolling grill, a drink machine that never has enough carbonation and I've felt off every time I've eaten there. They are nostalgic for mw and they were to first to open up their arms to the furries at Anthrocon, but that's only worth 2 stars."
"5.0","Had another very nice dinner at this comfortable BYOB restaurant. My wife had the catfish special and was very pleased. I had the pasta which is loaded with a variety of wild mushrooms. For mushroom lovers it is a must try but too many mushrooms for me. Was not my favorite. The Gouda is wonderful as is the bread with dip. Good salads included with the meal. Nice to see a reasonable corkage fee $2 per person."
"2.0","Worst service I've had. The food was good but it took 30mins and it wasn't even busy at that time. Then the check and boxes took a while too."
"5.0","It was my first time in this cafe and the atmosphere immediately took me by surprise. The walls are covered in vintage artwork. Our server Julia was exceptional and the food was delicious. I would recommend this spot to anyone looking for a quick andbite. Coffees good too! I'm in love with this place"
"4.0","Sausalido, I'm into you!What a cute little place! Again, I ponder why it took me so long to come here. Maybe it's a hidden gem?? Whatever it is, I can't wait to go back! Everything on the menu appealed to me, which is always a good sign. Oh yeah, also a good sign, deliciuos bread and hummus on the table!I was with a party of six and as soon as our food came out, I was struck by what a beautiful presentation it was. I mean, everything looked fresh and delicious, with a lovely looking plating to boot! I was in the mood for veggies, so I choose the roasted veggie wrap. It came LOADED with portabella mushrooms, red pepper, yellow squash, zucchini, asparagus, carrot, mixed greens, parmesan and white bean spread in a spinach tortilla. I also loved the balsamic dressing inside. It was just a nice refreshing meal for lunch. Not too heavy and definitely on the healthy side.I was VERY intrigued by the dinner menu though. I must come back soon to get some of the seasonal items (yum pumpkin!)."
"4.0","I ate here with my mom and aunt once and the line was out the door but for how busy it was we go sat very fast and our food came out fairly quickly. I ordered a bbq since it was more lunch time for me and it was decent but I'd definitely like to come back and try their breakfast options which looked delicious. My mom and aunt ordered their breakfast my mom got French toast and it looked amazing I definitely want to come back and try other stuff on their menu the next time I'm in the strip."
"1.0","Two Saturday's ago, my husband and another couple went to the city to experience Christmas in Pittsburgh. We were all favorable toward Redbeards prior to, so we decided to go there for dinner. Unfortunately, the experience was a disaster from the moment we walked in. When we arrived, we told them of our reservation which they didn't have for us. The hostess went to the manager and we were told we could be placed in from of everyone, but making a reservation online doesn't guarantee a table that same night... isn't that the point of a reservation?After we got seated,we ordered waters, drinks, and wings as an appetizer. When we got our wings, we received no plates, napkins, or silverware for 10 minutes. After the 10 minutes, one of us went up to ask for plates and napkins. It wasn't until he got back to the table where we realized the plates were dirty with not just residue on them, but sauces and lettuce... this was also after we hadn't gotten any refills for about 10-15 minutes. While we were still waiting patiently for our wraps and burgers that we ordered, the manager came over and said we may be moved because a large party was coming. He beat around the bush by telling us that when our food comes out 'we'll see if we can find you something downstairs'. Unfortunately, he did this to the table of men and women next to us, too. After we told him the sour experience we've been having he kept apologizing, however we'd still maybe have to move because the large party had reservations. When we told the manager we had reservations he asked if we made them on Yelp and ignored the fact. Our friend also told him how slow the service was and that we had to get our own plates and the manager interrupted him saying, 'Yes I gave you those' enthusiastically, however when we showed him how dirty they were he kept apologizing and asked us to reconsider in the future. My husband, who doesn't anger easily, told him that if they move us we are leaving and the manager seemed fine with that saying they'd cover our expenses! If we weren't waiting so long for our food, it probably would have been our soon and we would have been out of there in time for the large party. The moral of this terrible experience is that the management didn't value us as customers. To disregard our reservations, have poor wait service, be given dirty dishes, and have a manager tell us we need to move so someone else can sit where we are? I've never experienced something like that before. It's a shame because Redbeards won't be getting our money any time soon."
"1.0","I will never come back here.Background: my friends and I came back to Pgh for Pitt's homecoming, as it is most of their 10 year anniversaries. Half of the group came in to get a table and sat, while 3 of us came about 30 min later but we told them to order. When I came in, I was surprised one of my friends wasn't eating already, but shrugged it off. I ordered along with a couple others, and got food about 15 min later. My friend still didn't get hers and it was just a French toast and bacon! We asked several times where the food was, and we were told it was 'coming right up'. A gentleman came to the table to see what the issue was and he said that maybe someone else had gotten her food. She ended up waiting a full 55 min...unacceptable. Again, some of us ordered over 30 min after my friend, and got our food before her. On our way out we stopped at the counter to pay. We all paid and then when it got to the friend who received her food late, he wanted to charge full price. My friend offered to pay for the tea, as that was the only item she received in reasonable time, but he said no. He said we should have raised the concern earlier and insinuated that we had not had an issue until payment...when he was the one we had talked to earlier! This man became even ruder, telling me 'I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to her' when I tried to help explain what happened. He demeaned my friend and said, 'No I get it my friend, you just don't want to pay' with a smirk. He made it seem as if we were just trying to catch a deal. The situation ended with him telling her 'Don't worry about it, you just don't want to pay so you should leave.' Extremely disrespectful.Just to say one more time, I won't be back."
"5.0","Great place late at night if you are hungry. Staff was very friendly and a great place to bring the kids."
"5.0","Never have I been so thankful to go my dentist (a few doors down) and stumble across a breakfast spot. For less than $9 I grabbed a delicious coffee with some Nutella/banana crepes and was in and out in 20 minutes.It was one of those mornings that I ordered exactly what I wanted and enjoyed it immensely, so the five stars are awarded accordingly. Looking forward to stopping here again."
"4.0","The old standby for takeout food at lunchtime, $9 gets you all you need. Very fast and good."
"3.0","Based solely on the lunch buffet on a Sunday afternoon. It was just OK. I really don't eat red meat, and they didn't have a lot to choose from the buffet. The only chicken option today was 'Indo-Chinese Dragon Chicken.' The sauce was OK, but the meat didn't seem like fresh chicken... I also had the vegetable vindaloo (fantastic), a chickpea dish that wasn't Chana masala (good), rice (meh), a potato dish (blah), and the naan (zzzzz). I was hoping they would have chicken tikka masala or chicken makhani, but they did not have this at the buffet. I might try the restaurant again since it has mostly good reviews, but I probably won't be doing the buffet again."
"4.0","Tacos and drinks were great. You'll miss it if you aren't paying attention. I'm a Texas taco girl and was impressed."
"3.0","My husband and I went for restaurant week. Reasonably priced, byob and the corking fee was included with the restaurant week package. The atmosphere was cozy, even though the inside is small it wasn't too crammed. Staff was friendly and service was pretty good.Creative food choices, I loved the pumpkin ravioli and loved that they make their own salad dressings. We had quinoa meat balls as an app and they took some aclimating to but they were pretty awesome and ended up being the main thing I remember. Definitely a good place to spend diner with friends, I plan on returning to try more of the menu"
"5.0","I've never been to this place before but apparently have walked by it a bunch of times. It's a nice little space with delicious food and quick service."
"5.0","Legit the best sushi place in Pittsburgh. If you don't like sushi don't go here. If you like sushi then this will be a treat. I've been to dozens of sushi places in my life, and the quality as well as atmosphere at Kiku is unmatched. Everything is extremely fresh, and if you come for lunch on a weekend there is guaranteed to be nobody there. From the service, to the hot towels, to the food, this place is hands down the best in the Burgh!"
"1.0","Don't eat here if you have an allergy or some food sensitivity. Damn shame as this place was always my favorite and choices in Pittsburgh are limited but I'll never come back."
"1.0","My boyfriend and I love crêpes and wanted to try out a new restaurant for brunch. We both regretted it right after we ordered. The waiter was extremely slow. We waited 25 minutes just for our cappuccinos. Finally, a warm wilted salad arrived for me and 'fruit plate' with a whole nectarine, a whole un peeled orange, and a stem full of grapes arrived for my boyfriend. Then we were served a tasteless crepe with overcooked chicken in it and a plain crepe with a few slices of banana and Nutella drizzled on it. The whole horrible experience took almost two hours. Absolutely will never come back!!"
"4.0","I had a Groupon, saw the less than 3 star rating but decided to form my own opinion. I loved the food and the service was good."
"5.0","Best taco's I've had in in pittsburgh (so far, anyways). Better than the extremely overrated and overpriced tako. Better than la palapa (way cooler vibe, as well). Even better than Las Palmas imo (although it's close). They are friendly, the decor is awesome, there are tons of rare pops, they take cards, food is super cheap and extremely tasty. Can't wait to return."
"1.0","This is the 2nd time we've ordered from Genoa's in the past few weeks. Both times, we were missing part of our order... We called to let them know and only received a nasty attitude in response.This will be our last time ordering from Genoa..."
"2.0","If they are famous for being run down with poor service, then they have succeeded. The service is very unfriendly. They make you feel like you are inconveniencing them by being there.The corned beef sandwich was just mediocre...nothing special. I won't be returning"
"4.0","I came here the other night with a friend and her parents after a late dinner. Her dad claims to be 'the original Dirty Harry'. We had a blast and the drinks and atmosphere were very Pittsburgh. Patrons are allowed to smoke inside, it did not bother me but it bothered some of the people in our party."
"4.0","There is a super delicious, cute little Chinese place downtown - who knew?We didn't. For years. Until we went on a Just Ducky tour.We found out about the Chinatown Inn when we learned, on our Ducky tour, that there used to be a full Chinatown area in Pittsburgh. Aside from a few building facades, the Chinatown Inn is the last standing remnant of that era, and it's tucked away on a side street that makes it nearly impossible to find without word-of-mouth or a wrong turn directing you there.And it's a shame to miss this place. It's so cozy inside, quiet, carpeted, and lined with thickly upholstered booths that give you the impression you've escaped busy city streets and stepped into a magical, relaxing little cove.We ate just about everything on the menu. The wonton soup is probably the #2 wonton soup I've had in Pittsburgh. Their wontons are not stuffed, but the egg noodles are thick, and the bowl is filled with chicken strips and scallions. Delicious!Even with lunch, they bring you a pot of tea at no charge, and the lunch specials offer either an egg roll or a soup of your choice for under $8. (The only odd thing is that there's no pork on the lunch menu. Not sure about dinner, but it was just chicken, beef, and seafood for lunch.)We also added on an order of the crab rangoons, which were my favorite part of the meal. They were so crispy on the outside, so creamy on the inside. If I was craving crab rangoons, I would go out of my way to stop in here for an order.For our entrees, we got sweet and sour chicken and General Tso's chicken. Both were excellent. Like the crab rangoons, they achieved that perfect mix of crispy outside and juicy inside. But what I was most impressed with was the balance of meat and sauce: too often, Chinese restaurants end up overdoing the sweet and sour or General Tso's sauce, but this was just right.We also sprung for one of the 'jumbo' egg rolls. I'll say this: it was definitely jumbo! It was the size of about three regular egg rolls (picture posted in the photo section), but the problem was that with it being so gigantic, the insides were a little mushy. The outside was perfect though, but I think if we got egg rolls again, we'd go for the normal-size ones.All in all, this place was a hit. They've got a full bar, takeout, and really prompt service. We were in and out in well under an hour, so if you work downtown and are in the mood for Chinese, this place is just right!"
"4.0","Pizza here is pretty good, and a pretty good value. The cheese reminds me of the pizza at Costco, which is both a good and bad thing. If I want really good pizza I'll go to Pizza Sola, but if I want something affordable, but not PIzza Hut cheap, this is the place."
"4.0","tom yum soup = awesome (cures both jetlag & a cold).  good service.  good as takeout.  BYOB."
"5.0","Had a late lunch here this past Saint Patty's day. Nick was an amazing server. Not only was he attentive and a delightful presence, he took his time answering all of our questions about the menu. I had the Fox Chapel and their house brewed Hipster Tone IPA. The food was delicious and I didn't feel icky after my burger and fries. This is a testament to their quality, fresh in ingredients. Their beer was also amazing. As an IPA lover, It was my first time having a Northeastern IPA and I'm sold. Definitely coming back soon!"
"4.0","The first thing I will say about this place: Excellent and polite service. The second thing is that the food is always hot and tasty. However, I look at this place as more of a fast food restaurant. Instead of fast food prices, they tend to charge a good bit more than the average fast food. Don't get me wrong, it's totally worth every penny, but that would be literally my only complaint. Everything else is spot on."
"5.0","I went here for my birthday with three friends and Sausalido is amazing! First off, the food is delicious. We had the fried gouda appetizer and the daily risotto, crabcake risotto, and the duck entree. I felt the crabcake risotto was a bit on the creamy side (I personally don't like my food that heavy/creamy) but the taste was good. I think we all overloaded a bit too much on the bread, bean dip, and fried gouda. Get the fried gouda. It's amazing.The best part about our experience was the service. Our waiter was attentive and personable. When we told him it was my birthday he made the appetizer on the house and gave me a free slice of cheesecake. So sweet! Will definitely be coming back :)"
"1.0","Been here twice the first time the food was below average but the waitress was very nice so I figured I'd give them a second chance. Today the food again lacked flavor and wait staff were mediocre at best. When we first sat down they brought us bottled water we said no thank you and asked if we could have tap water instead we were told by the gentleman host that the filter was broken and that the 'nasty bacteria' would make us really sick. When the waitress came over we again asked for tap she also said the filter doesn't keep out the bacteria and we should drink the bottled water. When we asked the waitress if they use bottled water for their coffee/tea, hand washing, rinsing of fruits & vegetables and cleaning of dining ware the waitress said they use the tap water. So either the host & waitresses have this lie teed up to make a quick buck on 8oz bottles of water or it's a health code violation. Regardless I called the health inspector and can't wait to see what new and exciting restaurant takes this dump's place."
"2.0","Severely disappointed after my friend had a drink spilled on him by our server. The manager came out  and apologized then cracked a few jokes. We were all very understanding, thinking they would make it right with a free side dish or something. Dry cleaning at the very least, but nothing. My friend had to sit there uncomfortably, in a soaked shirt. Wish I could give 5 stars as the food was great."
"4.0","Great value pizza. Not the best best pizza ever, but a very good pizza to hit the spot when you are hungry or to have with a beer."

"5.0","Impressive ability to deliver Pamela's Diner experience at multiple locations across the Burgh. The Shadyside location is always packed, but the experience is just as fantastic as in the strip District. Food is great, staff are friendly, and the best thing is once you're done with your meal you're right on Walnut Street. Highly recommend Pamela's for everything they serve, but the corn beef hash is my favorite."
"3.0","Starting with the valet, they never used to charged for it, just tip; now it is $8 dollars plus tip. The restaurant it's already expensive to begin with. I don't like greediness. Our waiter was not very friendly, just doing his job like a robot, again, for the prices, they should welcome you and smile more. Never order the coconut cream pie! There is no pie except for a bunch of whip cream!  Also, I know it's a meat place but I think it is of poor taste to have dead animals hanging from their walls like trophies. I will never go back again."
"2.0","I ordered a small chicago style pizza. I had to write a review to warn others- it's not true chicago style pizza. Also, the ingredients are a 6/10 at best (tomatoes are diced canned kind, sausage is teeny tiny and slightly chewy). But if you don't mind the 'cheapy' taste, go for it.I'm from out of town and have a hard time finding places that serve great food in Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, this chicago-style pizza from Gennaro's falls neatly into the sub-par category along with the others. I think next time I'll try Proper Brick Oven even though it's more expensive."

"1.0","I'd be surprised if this place is still in business next year.  Here's my visit:When: June 21, 2019 after the Bucs vs. Padres game at approximately 10:30 pm.  Almost all of the bars were packed except for JB 36.  Wanted a semi-quiet place to enjoy drinks, me and the crew rolled in.Service: Service was fast, friendly, and sufficient.  Drink: Ordered a standard Old Fashioned with Bulleit Rye Whiskey.  It was the worst Old Fashioned I have ever had.  After asking the bartender what she put in the drink, I was able to quickly diagnose the problem.  This bar uses cheap maraschino cherries.  You know, the type that's in your fridge that has the cherries floating in the super sweet, synthetic tasting syrup?  Well, when you take one of those cherries and drop it in a cold drink, the synthetic juice of that cherry dissipates into the drink and alters the taste entirely.  I wish they used fresh cherries or at least a higher quality cherry.  My friend had a rum and coke and he said there was almost no rum and it cost $10.Restroom: I was pretty surprised by the condition of their restroom.  2 of the 3 urinals had black garbage bags tied over them.  I assume this indicates they are out of service?  Unfortunately, several patrons did not get the message and had attempted to use the urinal.  This place used to be awesome, but it has fallen.  It's unlikely I'll be back and I think this place will be out of business by Summer 2021, at the latest."
"5.0","I want you all to know one thing, that this place, by far, has the best eggrolls you will ever eat in your entire life.I have lived in Pitt, NYC, Cleveland, and now DC....no where comes close.  Chinatown Inn's eggrolls are out of this world.  While their normal food is also very good, their eggrolls and fried rice are all I really order when I am in town.I always make it a point to get some before my trip back, and my family still goes to this place after all these years.  It's amazing, and you all need to recognize greatness when you experience it.Eggrolls.Amazing."
"4.0","This is a good place to eat, after playing some slots my wife and I sat for a early dinner outside. I ordered the Cobb salad and she had the Po boy. Both came out looking good.  When my salad was placed in front of me it was enough to feed 2 people, we could have shared. My wife's sandwich could have had more to it but it did have a good taste . We had a nacho appetizer which was also good, the appetizers was a nice size, which we shared. The only complaint that we had was that the service wasn't the best. We would eat here again, but the service needs some improvements. I gave this place 4 stars."
"5.0","The food was AMAZING as was the beer. I love the decor and the atmosphere of bar. It definitely is a place I will be returning to. Highly recommend!"
"3.0","I visited Luke Wholey's earlier tonight for dinner with my parents.  I'd been wanting to try it for a long while now, so given that they're fans of good seafood and that I had a City Dining Card for it, this gave me the push necessary to try it.We started out by ordering the lobster bisque fries ($11), given that it was one of the more unique menu items and that many other Yelpers recommended them.  They consisted of fries over lobster bisque with chunks of lobster topped with scallions, and were the highlight of the meal.  If you like poutine, you'll enjoy them, for sure.  Because I wanted to try the lobster bisque by itself, I decided to order a cup of it with my meal ($7).  This turned out to be a mistake, given that it was too salty and rich for my taste, and that I felt that it was overpriced (for a cup).  If you're considering stopping here for lunch, bear in mind that you can get 4-5 times the amount of crab-lobster bisque of comparable quality across the street (with more seafood, no less!) in a quick serve setting at Wholey's Fish Market for less $.For our entrees, my mom ordered the crab cake salad ($15.95), my dad ordered the baja shrimp volcano ($28), and I ordered the crab stuffed salmon ($30).  While my salmon was well cooked and tasty with the sauce, it didn't blow my mind the way I expect for an entree at this price point.  Also, the bok choy served with my entree seemed a bit limp when served, and there was a piece of skin underneath my salmon.  While these may seem like minor details, I have a higher standard for fine dining-esque than for mid-range restaurants, so I can't let them slide.  I tried a piece of my mom's crabcake and some of the potatoes from my dad's volcano, and again, they seemed tasty, but not mind-blowing.  They both seemed satisfied enough--though they're not as exacting as I am when it comes to eating out.On the a positive note, our service was very good, so I have no complaints there.  The atmosphere is more casual than I was expecting, which fits with the atmosphere of the Strip District, but not with the fine dining-esque nature of the restaurant.  I concur with another reviewer that I'd be willing to give this place another shot for lunch (or happy hour), I don't think I'd be willing to pay dinner prices again.  Since my opinion is hovering between 3 and 4 stars, I'm splitting the difference and going with 3.5."
"5.0","The food is amazing one of the best Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh for sure. The best part is that the spice level is great and they give you a lot of food basically enough for multiple meals which is better from a lot of the places that try to make it all classy by giving you like to grains of rice."
"4.0","$6 for a large cheese pizza and open until 2:00 AM. (Anyone remember when it used to be $5?!)I found myself here after a friend's 21st spent getting her horns at Peter's Pub. It was a Sunday, other bars were closed, Sorrento's, and Mcdonalds were too!Pitt students will have their biases to either Antoon's or Sorrento's, but I'll let you be the judge of that.. their pies are the same price. It was an awfully cold winter night, so I could complain about the no seating from Antoon's, but their extremely fast service makes up for it. If it weren't so cold outside, that pizza wouldn't have lasted our walk to our dining spot as we probably would have eaten it on the spot.Don't forget the ranch."

"4.0","I came to the Summit for the first time as I was a judge for one of their cocktail competitions. The staff is super friendly! The space is on the smaller side but the bar seating makes up for it. Their happy hour specials are great! I can definitely see myself being a regular here. Great cocktail selection that is well thought out and the ingredients are properly executed!"
"3.0","I love going to Alexander's mostly for the atmosphere. Check it out at Christmas as the decor is festive. The servers are so nice  and the food is mostly average to above average. The last time we were there however we were seated at a table too close to other customers. They appeared to be sick and it was just uncomfortable. I will make sure the next time we go to that we not sit so close to other customers."
"5.0","Considering its guests are prone to proffering illicit drugs in pill form, especially the homeless vagabonds attempting to solicit a taco and mooch off every patron inside, the food is life-changing and should not be missed despite the grungy frequenters."
"1.0","Even a 1-star rating is an overstatement given the fact that I threw up (literally, not metaphorically) after eating at Umami...My bf and I went there on Saturday night. We ordered Takoyaki (octopus balls) to start with, which was pretty delicious. We then had a special roll with spicy tuna and eel, which was decent (albeit overpriced at $18), and a number of robatayaki (pork belly, chicken thigh, shrimp, chicken heart, mushroom, and eggplant). The 'highlight' of the night (which we sincerely thought would be the highlight) was a grilled whole fish (red snapper). It came out slightly burned and just wasn't that delicious. We didn't finish the entire dish since neither of us liked that dish much, and both of us started feeling nauseous immediately after eating it and especially after we left the restaurant. After I got home 20 minutes later, I literally threw up... My bf didn't throw up but he had to rest for 2 hours before he started to feel normal again. We have no idea what could have caused the sickness; we both eat a lot of seafood on regular basis, raw or cooked. I also have a pretty strong stomach and the last time I threw up was years ago when I had food poisoning... Maybe this is a coincidence (I do hope that is the case), but we would NOT return to the restaurant again..."
"2.0","Coming here is only worth it if you go while they have their buffet open! It's run of the mill North Indian food and isn't bad but isn't wonderful either. I would not come here if they are not having their buffet open because the dish prices are expensive considering the quality/quantity of the food."
"1.0","I came across this taco shop and was excited since I am new here from the West Coast where Mexican food, especially tacos are very common. I was highly disappointed in the lack of authenticity. I ordered a beef taco, which was made of ground beef, not carne Asada (seasoned cut steak) and I also ordered the loaded nachos which came with pork. The nachos were covered in a cheese 'sauce' (instead of melted shredded cheese). The pork was ok but both were very bland and extremely 'white washed' Mexican. Unfortunately I will not be returning."
"5.0","Probably nearing a dozen visits here. We are unofficially rating our way through menu. Everything from food to staff to vibe is pure perfection."
"4.0","I felt very fancy schmany being in here for lunch.  You definitely receive the the same fancy schmancy service you'd expect too.  I was just very impressed with the whole experience from beginning to end.Trying to stay on the healthy side, I was a little nervous about going to a steak house.  Don't get me wrong, I love me some filet mignon.  And maybe another time, some filet will be had... But for now I had to stay on the safe side.  The soup of the day was lobster bisque.  Darnnit! I love lobster bisque!  That was a hard one to avoid.  So... I ordered that and kept the rest of the meal light.  The lobster bisque was awesome!  A tomato base with a HUGE piece of lobster in the bottom.  NICE surprise!For the main course I ordered the scallops in lemon sauce instead of butter and sauteed greens.  It was a fantastic choice because it tasted yummy and was on the healthy side.  The scallops were a great size, seared and cooked perfectly, with a light lemon sauce.  The greens were also served in the lemon sauce, which made them equally as delicious and flavorful.  I had one tiny tiny bite of their creme brulee cheese cake and it was to. Die. For!  Seriously, if you're going for dessert, any choice is probably going to be a good one considering the choices I heard that day!  I must say again, the service was stellar.  From start to finish everything was taken care of.  The servers were extremely friendly too, and seriously seemed like they enjoyed their job and the food there.  So if you're looking for a fancy schmancy night out with stellar service and food, this is your place!"
"3.0","This is a decent (if pricy) sushi joint. My chief complaint is fairly nitpicky (ad someone who lived and ate a lot of sushi in Japan). I had salmon, tuna, sea urchin, salmon error row and eel nigiri. The fish on the nigiri was quite cold, and the rice was not even lukewarm. The contrast of the temperatures was  just not right, but the fish was fresh. The sea urchin was just okay, which I probably should have expected. My companions had the chicken teriyaki, which looked like a meager portion, and they said it was not very well grilled or seasoned. The matcha cheesecake was delightful, though."
"2.0","No Gatorade, tater tots, or sticky rolls. This place sucks!! They've gotten rid of everything mediocre so don't waste your time coming here. 2/5 is too nice but I feel like being generous today :)"
"5.0","This place is awesome. Just realized it existed and will be coming here on the regular. For those who may not know, there's a cafeteria here where you can sit down and chow down on some delectable Indian and Mediterranean cuisine!"
"5.0","Been here in 2016 and early December 2018. Not sure why the rating is low. The ambience is very comforting and pleasant. And I enjoyed my visit on both the times.The first time (2016), we had lunch and ordered an Alfredo with Penne. It was creamy and flavorful, an Alfredo I preferred. The only reason I didn't go back was because I was a student and I wanted to eat veryyyy cheap and save some greens in my pocket. :PThe second time (2018), we got dinner. We ordered some Fried Ravioli which had a good crispiness and a soft filling. It was served with a hearty Marinara sauce.I also got an Angel Hair Pasta with Marsala Wine sauce, mushrooms and roasted red peppers. The taste was just the right amount of savory to keep eating forever. Mostly a toned down tanginess and a little black pepper, along with he hint of sweetness from the roasted red peppers. I paired this with a glass of Australian red wine that I don't currently recall (it was a new one on our server's recommendation). But I remember it being a good recommendation.I would definitely recommend this place if you want a good Italian dining experience for a reasonable price! :)"
"5.0","Had the BLT croissant with potatoes. Perfection,totally. The baklava was to die for! Highly recommend. If its a nice day, ask to sit outside...its a balcony on the roof. Great brunch place!"
"5.0","I've long been a seeker of those places that make you feel like you are having that quintessential city experience. Things like riding a subway, eating a meal by big windows overlooking downtown, taking in a show, kissing you significant other under the lights on a snowy night in the holiday season... The Garden Cafe just made that list. And the best part was it wasn't something I knew would fit the bill.The Garden Cafe sits in the courtyard next to Heinz hall, on the corner of Liberty and 6th (where 6th doglegs to become Market in front of the Fairmont Hotel). The cafe is only open on days when the weather forecast is favorable because the entire place is outside. You walk into the plaza, and there is a table with a register. You order here, and go and find a table on the brick patio, sitting among fountains, trees, and the beauty of this serene downtown setting, separated from the randomness and dirt of the sidewalk by the beauty of brick walls with lush greens growing atop. I had a chicken and brie wrap with corn something (salsa?) and some kind of Aioli suase... it was AMAZING. And it was served with a quarter pickle spear and fires. The fries were shoestring, crispy, DELICIOUS and awesome. The Wrap didn't seem huge (big enough, I figured, for a light lunch), and the whole thing was $7.something with the initial included 10% gratuity. I was stunned when I returned to my office and found myself fighting off a food coma. SO filling. This place is unbelievable and has such an amazing ambiance. You feel like you are really in a city, but an idealistic one where everyone is nice, all the air smells amazing, the new buildings are cool and unique and the old ones are classy and ancient in their stories. You get the feeling that you can conquer the world and when you get back to the office you are going to win that big account. OK... i guess this has nothing to do with the food, but it is pretty cool. The fountains, the trees, the food, the staff... all just really great! It was a little windy and that made it slightly challenging to eat normally, and the sounds from busses can on occasion be a little much. You will also hear any crazies yelling from the other side of the wall, but only the loudest ones. I would absolutely recommend this place. Weekdays 11:30-2:30, weather permitting."
"5.0","Best Indian we've had since we moved to Pittsburgh! I think a lot of the bad reviews come from the buffet or from the spicy levels. Unlike other places we've found around here, they actually bring the heat without being overpowering.We opted for an order of chicken tikka masala, malai kofta and naan. The chicken was in large, juicy chunks and the kofta was well seasoned and creamy. The naan was crispy and chewy all at the same time.I think they also do happy hour specials from 5-7 that includes $3 off chicken entrees and a rotating deal of cheaper appetizers depending on the day. We'll definitely be coming back here often!"
"5.0","I love Salem's. The food is excellent and the employees are fantastic. Their service is quick and I am always satisfied with my experience."
"4.0","First time here and it did not disappoint! It's a larger establishment than I thought and to my surprise wasn't crowded on this rainy Saturday evening. The service was great; very fast, friendly and attentive which always makes for an enjoyable experience.  Our server had another sever in training and she did a great job! We started with the fried goat cheese bites. They were so good and melted in your mouth! I had a beer (White Lightning) and my BF had a Dark and Stormy. Their beers they brew were all $1 off, which was cool. I had a 'Liberty' burger which was a cheeseburger with a special sauce and a side salad. Delicious! You can tell this is organic beef and I love farm to table and locally sourced restaurants! We also shared hand-cut french fries with rosemary, which was a nice flavoring. Well done, Burgh'ers!"
"5.0","Went here in late summer on a weekday and it was fantastic. Pamela's and DeLuca's go back and forth in battle for best breakfast in the city. There's not much to this place. Just a simple diner but the food is out of this world. I had a bacon cheese omelette, the wife had French toast and my son had the short stack of pancakes. With two coffees and a chocolate milk, the bill came to $31.00. It's a CASH ONLY establishment so be prepared. We'll be back!"
"3.0","A couple weeks ago, my boyfriend's coworkers decided to meet up after work for wings at Redbeard's on Sixth. I get off work a little later than he does, so when my day's duty was done I went to meet him down there. The Wednesday wing special is all you can eat wings for $12.99, which is a great deal! There is seating both upstairs and downstairs, but tonight we were seated upstairs since we had a large group of around 12 people or so. I sat down with the group and everyone seemed pretty pleased with their wings so far, and a couple people were still patiently waiting on the waitress to return with theirs. You can put in an initial order for 10 wings, and then following that you get your wings 5 per order. It wasn't a horribly long wait before the waitress came around, but it really wasn't busy to the point that you'd think you'd be waiting as long as we did before being checked on. I ordered a quesadilla, my boyfriend and some people ordered more wings, and some people ordered some drinks, too. The wait for our food wasn't bad, but the waitress didn't bring any napkins, so everyone around the table had wing fingers until she returned with them. There was one woman in particular that didn't receive her wings after several of the waitress' trips back and forth, and the waitress had eventually said she forgot to put in the order and apologized. What was really strange, though, was that the old fashioned that the man sitting across from me ordered was BRIGHT RED. An old fashioned should never look like this, and I can only imagine what it tasted like compared to the real deal. Although it was definitely made wrong, it gave us some good joke material for the rest of the night.All in all, $12.99 for all you can eat wings is a good deal. My quesadilla was good, but nothing to really write home about. It was strange that it had olives in it, but aside from that it was good. I can't say that Redbeard's is on the top of my list for places I'd love to come back to, but for a large group it isn't a bad choice."
"2.0","We stopped in to have a drink while out shopping. We had one and left because the bar was filthy. Normally depend on The Capital Grill for high quality standards. Mentioned to front staff that the bar was cluttered with dishes and needed attention. Still, nothing was done."
"3.0","It was a Friday night, so a lot of the restaurants we tried had long wait times but we were seated right away at Redbeard's. We ordered the salmon croquettes and pretzel sticks for appetizers. The salmon croquettes were dry and were really lacking in flavor, so I could only eat it after spreading the queso sauce on top that we got with our pretzel sticks to make them more bearable. That was the first croquette. The second one tasted weird, like a chicken nugget. The pretzel sticks were warm and the queso dip was a good choice to go along with it. I wish they didn't have as much salt on them though. I ordered the Early Tee Time burger, which comes topped with a fried egg, crispy bacon, American cheese, and mayo and a side of steak fries. It was a pretty average burger; I've had much better burgers with egg and bacon. Friends ordered the fish & chips and the garden salad and both more or less enjoyed them.Taste | 2Atmosphere | 3Presentation | 3Service | 3OVERALL | 3"
"5.0","Great food as always. One of the best chicken sandwiches in PGH. Fries are average.  Tenders and chicken and waffles are very good too."
"4.0","Cinderlands is a newer brewpub in Lawrenceville with a modern vibe, unique food, and good beer.  If you're looking for somewhere to get a cheap Yuengling and a basket of wings, this may not be your place, but if you are looking to try some interesting food combinations and sample some local beers, this is the place to go.  The menu is a bit limited and pricey, but all of the options appeal to an adventurous eater.  Our waitress was friendly and helpful and made sure our meals were made to order with any specifications that we made.  We did notice a disclaimer on the menu that all fried menu items are fried in peanut oil, so be careful if anyone in your group has a peanut allergy. Overall - interesting food and good beer in a clean and cute establishment"
"1.0","This place is a scam. I ordered Chicken Tika Masala instead they gave me a wrong order and when I asked them to replace it they refused and told me I was wrong. The food they gave me was nasty and the chicken was not cooked properly. Also they overcharge for naans. I highly recommend not to go to this place"
"3.0","I was walking through the strip looking for someplace to grab a bite. So I walked into Peppi's to sit for lunch, honestly the place looked a little run down so I wasn't sure what to expect. I ordered a steak and cheese sub, with fries. The fries came out quickly, but were pretty soggy. Luckily, I was very happy with the sandwich. The bread the sub came on was good quality with quality ingredients. I also liked that the sandwich was not so overly stuffed, so it was easier to eat. I would go here for a sandwich again, but maybe just leave it at sandwiches."
"5.0","The Summit is a great bar with nice atmosphere (the garage-style rollup windows are awesome for summertime) and delicious cocktails. The food is also quite good. Portion sizes are enormous. Bartenders are solid. It's quiet on a weekday evening although there were few chairs available regardless. I imagine the weekend experience is a different story. That said, no complaints. Highly recommended."
"5.0","Comfortable. Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Parking in the strip district can be a challenge but is worth it. Our food came quickly.   The blueberry ricotta pancake was light and fluffy and very tasty.  The eggs and potatoes were perfectly cooked.  The grilled peanut butter and jelly was tasty but I would have liked twice as much PB but that's just me.  The hangover special was delicious!!   Pulled pork and kielbasa and sauerkraut on a bed of mashed potatoes with the fried eggs was a perfect combination even without a hangover."
"5.0","The prices are high, but your definitely paying for quality, the quality of drinks and atmosphere are well worth it.Awesome spot for a group of friends, quiet enough to have a conversation and alive enough not to feel out of place.Also great for a date night, grab a table, and let the cocktail waitress take care of you. Also, ALWAYS ask what they have special that night, innovative and delicious drinks in the works at all times.Friendly staff and great location"
"5.0","One of the last great Italian institutions in the city. The best part is that the food is awesome these days and they make an effort to keep the decor and the menu fresh. There are very good reasons why Del's is gone and Alexander's is still here. The pesto and the bread (both made fresh every day) are my favorite parts and are definitely crave-worthy. The grilled asparagus is also quite impressive given how simple it is, but I'd agree with Pepin in saying that the best food is ordinary things prepared extraordinarily well. I'm an epicurean 23 year old with Italian grandmothers so I think I have an idea of what's good.Alexander's is good for dates, family dinners with just the right amount of class, and people who like good bread.Alexander's is not good for sea urchin crunching, small-batch moonshine sipping, mise-en-place modernists. There are nice places like Lawrenceville and Umi for you."
"3.0","In a hurry to get back to work, I ordered the lobster mac and cheese to go. Atmosphere: Upon arrival, I noticed that the place was neat and the customers happy. Wish I could stay and enjoy my meal there. Food: I read a review that there were 'huge chunks of lobster' in this bowl. This was not the case with my Togo order. I maybe had a full 1-2 pieces of lobster about an inch in length. Maybe they were having an off day... but that's all I got. Quite disappointing considering the price. I might as well have ordered a single lobster tail."
"3.0","It's good service and decent food. Have had dinner there a couple of times and it's pretty good value for money. Had a la carte once and dinner buffet once when there was a 'so hungry cannot wait' group of 8 of us. While it was good and solid value for money, don't think I'll be going for buffet again. If you do go, check out their crackers mixed with pickled onion and green chutney. Add some red sauce on top of that - heavenly! Good service too - the waitstaff is courteous and pleasant. My SO wasn't happy that I left 25+% tip, for a buffet! Lesson learned for me. Sorry, Prince! But I think you can afford it ;-)"
"5.0","Great for brunch! We came around 11AM on a Tuesday and it was not too busy. You order at the front and then are seated at a table. My boyfriend and I both ordered the Little Guy's Breakfast Plate and it was amazing! Our table was also a little lopsided and although I didn't notice, our server was very attentive and fixed the problem. The blueberry ricotta pancakes were to die for and the rest of our food was good as well. We will be coming back here."
"1.0","In keeping with transparency, here is the majority of an email I sent directly the the Manager of Il Tetto. As I mention in my email, I believe this issue to be fundamental and consistent and doesn't appear to be getting better. After some deliberation, I've decided that I must write to you regarding my - and my group's - awful experience on Thursday night. If this were the first time I'd had a negative experience at your business, you wouldn't hear from me. However, I believe this to be a fundamental and recurring flaw, one that has occurred just about every time that I've visited Il Tetto. Simply put, the combative and disrespectful nature of your staff is a travesty. As a small business owner, as well as a full time bartender, it's also an embarrassment. Only on the most rare occasions have I been treated in such a confrontational and dismissive manner. As I mentioned, Thursday night was one of these occasions. I'd be happy top share details with you, if you care, but I'll leave it as your Door/Elevator Operator/Security Staff need serious training when it comes to customer service and interaction. This was not the first time and I've come to the conclusion it will not be the last. My friends and I WILL NOT be coming back. There are too many other fine establishments in the neighborhood that appreciate our business and show RESPECT to their customers. I understand the nature of these people's jobs: Dealing with people who have been drinking, generally in high volumes, etc. But the idea that being combative and disrespectful right from the start of an interaction will only ever end with an extremely negative experience. I've had enough. My friends have had enough. And from what I'm seeing on social media - and just in the several issues I've had at your place of business - this is not uncommon."
"4.0","Simple and delicious. The menu is very streamlined, which I like: four or five mains, four or five sides, and drinks. You've got 5 options for heat level - I got the Mild and I could have easily gone Medium, I think. My order of Chicken and Waffles was really good - the waffles were a little crispy on the edges and soft on the inside, and two crispy delicious tenders."
"5.0","Loved it! Thoroughly enjoyed my beer, Brussels sprouts, pierogies, and pop tart for dessert. It's like upscale comfort food, yum! Will definitely be back."
"5.0","Sick place. Scallops were the shit. Great service. Great beer and whiskey selection. I will be back"

"3.0","No spinach! What makes some Subway restaurants have spinach and not others? Almost not worth going to for this reason.Otherwise, average Subway expectations."
"2.0","Came to this bar on a whim; was hoping for a better atmosphere and was disappointed. My friends and I were looking for a place to relax and watch the baseball game and when we asked the server if the TV could be changed we were told we have to wait for the hockey game to be over. Even though there were 5 tv's showing the game with no one watching it. Sure no problem, then we asked another server what kinda of wheat beers they had on tap not only did she have no idea but she also did not know the prices to what she was offering. The menu did not have beers prices hence the reason why we had to ask. Then proceeded to stand around and gossip with the other girls, while the bartender threw ice cubes at the waitresses. I gave this restaurant 2 stars for their employees lack of knowledge before putting them on the floor, and not being very attentive."
"5.0","If you like high tops and a cool sushi bar vibe this place is for you. The sashimi rice bowl is the best.  Try the bacon wrapped quail eggs to start, as well as the octopus balls.The Ginger Ginger cocktail goes well with this meal. We also had the hot saki which I found a little overly sweet for my taste.The staff was attentive and knowledgeable. Will be going back in the near future!"
"4.0","My first time here was on a Wednesday around noon and I tried the $10 lunch buffet. The place was relatively empty but got more crowded as lunchtime approached, and the waiters was very attentive the entire time. I don't know too much about different Indian dishes but everything I tried was delicious, especially the naan with the spinach and potato dip, and a salad with chickpeas, onions, and green peppers. There were plenty of dishes along with salads, rice, and dessert. Fountain drinks and chai tea (you can choose to have it with or without sugar) were also included in the lunch buffet. Overall this was a great value for the buffet and I really enjoyed it! I would definitely stop by again for a quick lunch."
"1.0","Wish I read the reviews before ordering. A big no no if you care for your health and money. This place is disrespecting Indian Cuisine. Someone please tell the chef that there's a difference between red chilli and tomato paste. Please dont burn people's mouth and stomach with your mildness."
"5.0","Pretty damn good! I've had Chinese food pretty much everywhere and this was very good. Not greasy and fresh! Must try!"
"3.0","This is a 3.5, the drinks were great, awesome wines by the glass and of course a large beer selection.  However the appetizers were nothing to write home about.  The cheese platter was full of bland boring cheeses that were not worth the price . The pastrami was nearly all fat and dry.  The best thing tried was the duck confit fries and that was slightly above average. Very nice atmosphere, would go back JUST for drinks."
"5.0","I do not get a reason to eat at Capital Grille very often, however I needed to be in downtown Pittsburgh today for work lunch so I took advantage.  As always the service was spectacular and the food matched.  I had the ahi tuna which I think I have had each of the last two trips to Capital Grill.  It was amazing.  The rice was perfect as well as the asparagus.  Always perfect."
"5.0","I was searching through Yelp for a Sunday brunch spot and once again we ended up in Lawrenceville! Cinderlands to the rescue! Plenty of street parking and free on Sunday's. For being a small place it has quite a bit of seating, booths and a bar in the front, seating in the back of the restaurant and then more up in the loft area. I love how it was decorated, marble bar tops, dark wooden tables and a black and white patterned tile floor. We took our time with the menu and finally decided on the French toast for myself and diner burger for my husband. He also ordered a POG Whipper beer, a super citrusy wheat beer.We had quite a long wait for our food, but it was nice to be able to see the chef preparing our food right there from our table. Since it was a Sunday and we were brunching it was a nice time to chat and enjoy each other's company. When the food finally arrived and we started eating you could hear a pin drop. The food was FANTASTIC! Wow, what a great surprise.The French toast was 7 sticks perfectly crisp on the exterior and tender in the middle. Layered on top of the most delicious lemon curd, topped with maple whipped cream, fresh peaches and mint. To. Die. For. My husbands Diner Burger was another feast for the tastebuds. 2 patties cooked to an absolute perfect medium, still pink in the middle, bacon, sauce, and pickles. My husband's exact description for the pickles, 'they were ridiculous'! They tasted sort of like they were brined in a vinegar and oil mixture. They are too difficult to describe, so do yourself a favor and get this burger to find out for yourself. The fries that it came with were THE BOMB! The chef blanches the fries in vinegar and then coats them in malt vinegar powder and salt. S&V fries!! Hello??!! So good. So looking forward to coming back here again and ordering off the regular menu. Try it, you won't be disappointed."
"5.0","We live nearby to Caffe Mona and it's our favorite brunch spot. Here's my tips: Sit on the back patio, get the iced chai tea with an extra shot, get the Brentwood sandwich on an everything bagel and split an Nutella Love crepe. The perfect Sunday."
"5.0","Amazing apps! My friends always like to come here on wednesdays for all you can eat wings. I usually go for the half off apps which are all really good. It's a great sports bar to stop at while downtown, especially on game days."
"2.0","This place is old, like your grandparents basement. It looks charming with all the old decor of a knock-off Dean Martin second-hand yard sale.Anything positive ends with 'charm', when you enter that back dinning room your nose is greeted with all to familiar scent of piss, like really old piss, that's been festering for a couple days...just imagine pee'ing and not flushing the toilet, like ever. I got the spaghetti and meat balls with Angel hair and sauce. The spaghetti was over cooked, the sauce had a heavy dose of dried parsley and meatball had zero flavor. I actually didn't know meat could could achieve that level of bland. It's was $17, they charged me $2 per meatball, and $13 for the pasta.My daughter got a side of angel hair (they have no kids menu, because this is a place for adults, really old adults who haven't the slightest fucking clue how too eat) pasta with butter, $6. They give u a basket of bread that's about 5 minutes from being a crouton.This place is like Del's, out dated with a complacent owner(s) who don't give fuck or just don't get It, luckily they should be out of business within the next two years."
"2.0","I won't be back. The food was OK, but the temperature of the food coming off the buffet was not what I would consider safe. I won't press my luck by going back."

We sampled much of the menu, Chicken Masala, grape leaves, shawarma, lentil soup, etc etc. Each more fresh and delectable than the next. Get out of the long lines and crowds and walk down to Salem."
"4.0","While everyone else stands in line at DeLuca's, Pamela's, Primanti's, I am perfectly happy to step right into Cafe Raymond and have a delicious breakfast or lunch. The first time I stopped in here for a quick lunch and was intrigued by the veggie muffuletta. It came with portabella mushrooms as the 'meat'. Although it wasn't quite as good as the original, it was certainly tasty and a bit healthier. Since then I have been here several times for breakfast and lunch. Everything I have tried has been excellent and the service is always good. There is very clean restroom facilities in the basement for customers (a good find in the strip). As a matter of fact, the whole restaurant is clean and bright with a definite New Orleans vibe. There is always water with fresh lemon available as self-serve. The bread is homemade on site and so is the breakfast sausage. I really love this place!"

"4.0","Simply put, Pamela's is a Pittsburgh staple.  I regularly go to the one in Shadyside, but have also been to the one in Oakland.  I can't speak for the rest, but I like the one in Shadyside better, simply because the home fries/lyonnaise potatoes (or whatever you call them) are a better consistency and taste better than those in Oakland.  That aside, the banana chocolate chips hot cakes are to die for.  Seriously.  If you have never gotten them, you must.  You simply cannot live in Pittsburgh but never have had those hotcakes.My husband gets the omelets and really enjoys them.  The cinnamon raisin french toast is also very very good.  The only downside is that it's cash only (at least the one in Shadyside is), but meh, going to the ATM is totally worth having such a delicious breakfast.  Always good (and fast, sometimes surprisingly amazingly fast) service.  Pamela's is one of the best breakfasts in Pittsburgh."
"4.0","I work in the Grant St. corridor of down town Pittsburgh.  Our quick lunch options are limited in this area.  If you tack on the requirement of being health conscious and/or the product containing fresh ingredients, the options become even more limited.As such, when I saw an eatery with fresh in the name 'I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, homes to Bel Air''.... no really that song was the first thing that sprang to mind.  After that, I realized that we not only had a new option but we also had an option that claimed to be serving 'fresh' food.  I had to check it out!Disclaimer, I cannot prove that ingredients are delivered fresh every day or anything like that.  I can say for certain that everything seems to be very fresh.  More important, when I'm done eating their food I feel full in a good way and I stay full much longer than I do after eating at the other local quick lunch places.  This sort of tells me that the food is doing a better job as fuel than other foods.I tend to order the Mediterranean Bowl with grilled chicken.  This dish is rather large and really doesn't require any sides.  From the feta, to the olives, to the red peppers, to the sauce, to the everything else.... the flavors blend perfectly together.  In fact, it barely needs the  chicken.  In the end, everything that I've had to eat here has been great.  The service is generally really good as well.  In fact the owner is often on site!  The only downfall with eating healthy is that you tend to pay more.  But don't let that stop you from giving this place a try.  Sometimes you get what you pay for."
"5.0","We had a great lunch. Lobster bisque is the best in the city. My lunch was a lobster roll steel city style. My wife enjoyed crabcakes salad. You can't beat this place if you like fresh seafood."
"5.0","This place has hands down the best pepperoni rolls I have had in my life. Sure it's a college town drunk food place but five stars for the amazing pepperoni rolls. The subs are toasted and pretty good too."
"4.0","My boyfriend and I were craving Chinese food while we were in town for the weekend, and boy, am I glad I found this gem! It's on a random side street and not very close to anything else in downtown and from the looks of the outside, I was skeptical of the place. But from the service to the food, it was delicious enough for us to go back AGAIN before leaving Pittsburgh! We started our order with fried pork dumplings which were pretty good. Not too doughy and ample meat inside. Then we ordered the Mongolian Beef which was fantastic, the sauce alone was tasty enough to just eat by itself with some rice! We also got Pork fried rice which was probably one of the best I've had ever (and I eat a lot of Chinese food)! I also got the General Tso's chicken which was a HUGE order and I felt so bad we couldn't take the rest home since we were staying at a hotel! The second time we went back, we got the Mongolian beef again and Pork Egg Foo Young. The only thing I wish was improved, was the gravy for the egg foo young. I'm used to having the creamy brown gravy and they serve it with a watery dark brown base which took away from the flavor I'm used to. All in all, I would recommend this place for an inexpensive and quick fix for your Chinese takeout cravings!"
"4.0","Great food and service.  Very happy with flavour of burger and of fries.  Milkshake left a bit to be desired (was more like chocolate milk).  No wait for decent sized party (5) on a Wednesday night.  Very friendly staff.  Build your own burger might be overly complicated, but not too bad."
"5.0","Maybe I am starting most of my reviews as ' it was my first time' Yes for that place it was my first time. I never been in Pittsburg before and My significant other and I were watching the youtube videos about thing to do in Pittsburgh and we saw that place and added my bookmarks right away. I can't describe how much I love desserts and couldn't imagine without that. I am located in New York and I never been any bakery like that. if is there any option I would like to give 10 stars for La Gourmandine Bakery.The Decoration of the bakery was nice and it was so clean in there.I had vanilla cream chocolate chip croissant which is so delicious and fluffy. They have so many Because of that I couldn't wait to go back there again. Comparing the pricing New York, I am so surprised and we paid $9.90 for two Croissants, black tea and I iced coffee. I highly recommend that bakeshop. Can't wait to go back there Thank you"
"4.0","Overall we had a great experience at capital grille for restaurant week.  Food great, ambiance perfect, timing of courses was spot on.  Everything you expect for The Capital Grill.  Unfortunately service was a downfall, which I never see at this type of place. Our server Matthew was just a little odd.  He seemed to be a very fake person and I truly felt he was not enjoying his job.  I felt like I was being belittled the entire time.  Next time I done there I will specifically request NOT to have his as my server."
"5.0","After taking the incline to the top, my boyfriend and I stopped in for dinner. We picked this place out a few weeks before traveling to Pittsburgh because all the other restaurants at the top of the incline are very fancy and we were really just looking for something more laid back and this place checked that box. We were greeted right when we walked in and only had to wait about 10 minutes for a place at the bar. The bartender was an absolute delight, so friendly, kind, and informative! I got the smoked gouda mac n' cheese that was very creamy which I enjoyed very much! The cheese plate was also very good, even though the cheese weren't anything special it was still enjoyable. Something to note, this place is open to the outside so it was very warm which could be an issue for some people. They might have AC but it defiantly wasn't on when we were there."
"4.0","Nice little lunch spot hidden right off of Cherry Way. Walkling in, there is little room to sit with only a couple tables outside and inside with some standing tables. Seems more like a grab-and-go place. I decided to get the Sifrina arepa and a chicken empanada. The chicken in the Sifrina was seasoned very well, I just wish that they avocado and cheese were mixed through with the chicken rather than a dollip on top of the chicken. Nonetheless, the arepa was very tasty, yet light despite the bun being fried. The empanada had a bit of a heavier fry compared to the arepa - very tasty for how simple they are, just chicken on the inside. Next time I'd probably pass on the empanadas and get a second arepa as they are only a couple dollars more. I'd definitely come back whenever I want something different from my typical lunch spots - the price is right, the food is well seasoned and tasty, and it'll keep you full without putting you in a food coma - perfect for lunch!"
"4.0","Came here twice now and I gotta say that the quality of the food is on point. The calamari and sushi rolls are pretty good for the price along with the selection of beers. The regular entrees are a hit or a miss though. The volcano shrimp entree looks cool but it's pretty much just a giant pile of mashed potatoes. The land and sea was pretty good and so was the lobster macaroni."
"5.0","Genoa is amazing!!! I've been in Pittsburgh for a couple of weeks for work. I've gone to Genoa just about every one of toes nights. Great food no matter what you order, and an awesome full bar as well. Amanda and Ashley are awesome bartenders. If you're in the area, this is a MUST STOP. Seems like a great place to watch football, GO CHARGERS, or the Penguins game! Thank you Amanda, Ashely, and Billy for making me feel at home out here in Pittsburgh!!!!!!!!!!! I'll miss you 3."
"3.0","Good food but on the pricy side. It's the Best Chinese restaurant around downtown."
"3.0","Ordered a chili and double stack burger (medium) with mash potatoes and gravy.The service is great- kind, courteous, pleasant.The mash potatoes and gravy are awesome.Th chili should be renamed to hamburger soup with vegetables. Very little seasoning.The medium double hamburger was not pink and warm inside (see pic). Instead well done and dry. Thankful for ketchup.Did I eat it - yesDid I pay for it - yesWould I return - doubt it."
"5.0","It is really, really hard to find good lamb in the city.  Salem's takes care of that for you.  They do a great job with everything you could want.  Leg, boneless, I even saw a guy walking out with a lamb head, they will do it all for you.  The lamb is the best tasting and they will trim it down so it has no fat on it.  I loved it!  I went back the next time to try their lunch counter/dinner options of prepared meals.   Fantastic.  Their chicken gyro is not a 'gyro' but a marinated piece of chicken.  I loved the marinate they put on it.  I had goat curry (which I have never tried) and loved it.  I plan on going back here to get all my meats in the future. I also heard a rumor they have grass fed beef if you ask for it."
"5.0","Great food and great location! The complimentary white bean appetizer is delish and the side salad is also great. My favorite dish is the Crabcakes, best in the city if you ask me."
"5.0","Had a wonderful experience a Luke Wholey's. Our appetizers and main course was exceptional.   When you go ask for Drew as your server. You will not be disappointed."
"5.0","I'm so happy this place exists. It's exactly what I want for the North Side (and a little jealous it's not what we have in my neighborhood, Dormont). An inviting coffee shop with plenty of seating, and best of all fantastic food and drinks. While it's not a full bakery (they have cookies and scones), they do have a ton of really fantastic sandwiches and salads, made to order. I'm absolutely OBSESSED with the pear and chicken salad, that's mixed with fresh arugula, pecans and goat cheese. I can't not get it every time I'm in. But I have no doubt the other food items are killer too.. and once the summer ends I'll be forced to get something else seasonal. But that's not a bad thing!I love tea, so this is just the spot for me. They freshly brew all their ice teas and this summer my go to has been the peach oolong iced tea, that they lightly sprinkle cinnamon on. They also have a variety of loose leaf teas to choose from for hot or cold choices. I can only imagine what I'll get obsessed with once the winter comes along!The only gripe I have is that the service is on the slower side. If there's a line to order, it may take you a bit to get up to the front to order. The food, like I said, is made to order so it's not going to come out fast, but I wouldn't say it takes forever either. Just be prepared to wait about 15ish minutes. They have you covered on the wifi, so it's a great place for meetings and getting work done too. Like I need an excuse to come here though... I'm already hooked!"
"4.0","Neat restaurant.  There are 2 floors and on the second floor there is outdoor seating that over looks the strip.  The food was kind of pricey but a large portion and very good.  Everything was very fresh.  When we were there somehow the coffee machine was broken which was a huge disappointment.  Otherwise, it was a good breakfast."
"3.0","I really wanted to love this place. While the inside was unique and funky with decoration (approval).l, the food lacked the luster I was looking for.The lobster bisque fries were decent but could've definitely used more lobster. $11 for a piece of crab and some bisque with a basket of fries doesn't get me. The tiger roll was alright, but not as flavorful as I had hoped - with 4 different ingredients, I would've expected flavor explosions in my mouth... Not the case. Their lunch specials seemed like okay pickings. They serve a ton of edamame with their meals."
"4.0","I pop into Cafe Raymond if I'm hungry and strapped for time or if I'm too lazy to wait for a table at one of the more divey Strip District diners. You can get in and out of here fairly quickly. You order and pay at the counter and then take a number to your table. Food usually arrives within 10 minutes. I really love the new location. It's much roomier than the last space. Much more seating too!  Now you may think that $10 for a sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich is pretty outrageous. That is, until you experience said breakfast sandwich. There's practically an entire omelet and a half pound of sausage on that sandwich. The lemon ricotta pancakes are also well worth the dough. Yum! My usual go-to is the ham and Gruyere on a croissant. It's consistently delicious and the croissants are some of the best in town. The side potatoes are less consistent. Sometimes they are perfect, sometimes burnt, and sometimes overly salted. Potatoes are pretty much my favorite food group and a burnt potato is better than no potato so I'm not too bothered by the inconsistency. I'm always pleased with my experience here. It's a great Strip District restaurant option!"
"5.0","I have been here twice and had a great meal each time. This place has a cool atmosphere  with an 'under the sea' theme. Bar, dining, and outdoor seating. Service has always been friendly and helpful. The food was delicious and I will be back! Some of the sushi was pricey but worth the cost in my opinion! We went for brunch once and I had an eggs Benedict special which was fantastic! The lobster bisque fries were just okay and not as special as I thought they might be. If you are down at the strip and like seafood, you should definitely check this place out sometime! I will be back!"
"1.0","I've eaten at Rialto many many times since moving to Greenfield, however, I will not be eating there again.  Many of their pizzas are average to above average.  I've always thought they were a little expensive for the quality of pizza that you get, but they were always fast and convenient.  Last night I ordered a buffalo chicken pizza and it was totally flat (less than 1/4 inch), greasy, undercooked crust, cheese that just slid off the pizza, and funky tasting on top of all that.  Needless to say I was not pleased and I took the pizza back.  The owner did refund my money, which I appreciate, but he then asked me if I had ever had this pizza (God forbid I try something new) and when I replied no, he said 'Well, that's what the pizza is.' So I guess that means their buffalo chicken pizza is crap.  No apologies, no remorse that I found the pizza terrible, nothing.  No more business of mine then."
"4.0","Nice little place with sone unique offerings.  I had the trout with a watermelon, tomato salad topping.  It was very good."

"5.0","While enjoying another brunch at Caffe Mona (and loving the ambiance and the incredible savory and sweet crepes as we always do) and after beginning my search for venues to host my wedding rehearsal dinner, I asked our waitress whether Caffe Mona ever hosts after-hour events. After being directed to Eto (owner) to get more details we were delighted to find out that they do! We locked in the date with a 10% down payment on the negotiated price for our event duration and estimated guest count. Eto was fantastic to work with. Very accommodating on food, timing and layout and easy to coordinate with on day of for event decor set up and BYOB drop off. While we wanted to serve their delicious crepes for dessert we preferred to have a different style of cuisine for dinner. Eto brought in PHENOMENAL mediterranean. The flow of the space in terms of the way Eto and his team set up the tables, food and drink stations (including the use of the outdoor deck with those picture perfect umbrellas) was great for our ~50 person event. The execution of the event was so well done by Eto's team of friendly and attentive waiters/waitresses. Our guests had a wonderful time and it was everything we wanted our wedding rehearsal dinner to be and more. Strongly consider Caffe Mona for private events! You won't be disappointed!"
"4.0","First time there. Was very good. Similar to Morton's and Hyde Park. Everyone was very friendly and attended to our needs. Reservations are encouraged. Recommend the Kona filet. Fresh bread served. Recommend paying for valet parking for the convenience."

"1.0","Not what I was hoping for.Will never order again... wasted $40.00 on food I threw away."
"3.0","Gotta say... a bit disappointed.  Some things were really good and others were confusingly off-tasting.  I'm not a big IPA girl, so there weren't a lot of beer choices for me and the milk stout was okay.  The chicharrones were good but the beer cheese tasted off.  We got the buffalo chicken rillettes and we joked that it looked like cat food and the bread was burnt on the edges.  (we did like the pickled celery that came with it though!)  The pierogis were real good, but the 'goat cheese' (which looked and tasted a LOT like the beer cheese) didn't taste that great. lastly, we got the cookie plate- two of the cookies were divine and the third one tasted like someone added a wrong ingredient.  It seems like others like it, but there were far too many things that tasted off for such a high price, imo."
"2.0","This review is based on the combination of two visits.The first was a weekday lunch:  Walked over from  Children's and the place was empty. We were seated right away and the jerk chicken crepe that I ordered arrived quick and was fairly tasty. The second was a weekend brunch:  The cafe was semi-full but one table and the bar seating were available. We were seated quickly and ordered soon  after -- so far so good.Then came the wait. We waited for over 45 minutes for two orders of French toast - one savory and one sweet.  When they finally arrived, they were disappointing.  The berry topping on mine was half frozen.  My wife did not care for her spanakopita French toast.In summary:  Not a bad choice for a quick lunch, but I recommend looking elsewhere when it comes to brunch."
"5.0","Our group of 8 recently enjoyed dinner at the CG in Pittsburgh. It was a very busy night as the Steelers were in town and the restaurant was seating two very large groups of Cardinals fans. As we have come to expect from the CG, the food was excellent. But we found the  service to be below our past experiences. When our server delivered an overcooked steak to my wife,  a restaurant manager noticed our frustration and stepped in to relieve us of the need to lodge a complaint with our server. So that the my wife would not sit with nothing to eat while they fired another steak, the manager sent her a wonderful crabmeat cocktail. The manager later returned with a perfectly cooked steak. I learned the managers name is Nick and that not only is he excellent with patrons, he is highly regarded by his fellow employees. Bravo Nick!"
"5.0","This has become one of my favorite spots in the city. My favorite is the lamb gyro. The price is great and the amount of meat they give you is fantastic. The pita is fresh and it is packed with goodness. I also really love rice. They have some really great rice that is always cooked to perfection. They will even let you out some sauce from a dish on top at no extra cost. They offer free pita and fried pita with your order. I came during Ramadan for the buffet and was also fantastic. The customer service is what customer service should be. I'm happy that I found this place. It always makes me happy to see different people from different walks of life coming together to break bread."
"5.0","I enjoyed a wonderful meal of Pork Haluski last night. So full of flavor and very substantial! Definitely will return soon to enjoy more Sultry dishes!"
"4.0","General tso white meat is delicious. Their sauce is great.  Fast service and reliably good. Their egg rolls are my absolute favorite. I usually skip the egg roll and get soup, but not here. Shrimp egg roll rocks just don't eat it immediately and burn the roof of your mouth."
"2.0","I've gotten Rialto delivered a few times, and it seems to get worse each time. Tonight, on a very not busy Sunday, I received ice cold fried mushrooms and a pizza that looked like it had been tossed around and stepped on (all of the toppings and cheese had slid off, and the dough was smashed up against the opposite corner of the box). They're nearby and convenient, so I've been giving them second and third chances, but I'm officially done ordering from here."
"5.0","Pamela's is a dinner. Nothing fancy but down right hearty and delicious.  My wife and I ordered the eggs and corned beef hash and Pamela's famous crepe pancakes.  Both plates were big and filled edge to edge with food.  The eggs and hash were delicious and just as you'd expect: piled high with corned beef and potatoes.  The crepe pancake is a must.  It's quite possibly the best tasting pancake I've had.  The edges get crispy and the middle stays soft.  Atmosphere is what you would likely expect from a dinner: busy, loud, fun.  Don't be intimidated to ask questions or things that you might need. The staff is super nice.  They're just busy trying to keep the place chugging along.  BRING CASH if you intend to eat at Pamela's.  They are cash only.  Plan to spend around $10-12 per person.  You'll leave feeling full and super happy."
"1.0","Shit show. Lousy food. Tables need to be cleaned all over. Ineffective communications by little girls running the joint. Just very fragmented. Leadership is needed desperately. Better options are available."
"5.0","This is not your average Japanese restaurant, so plan accordingly! This restaurant is on the third floor above Cantina in Lawrenceville and has an over the top, club-like ambiance. I have never eaten in the sunken booth dining room, only the high-top table and bar side and it is lots of fun! Usually, in the evening there is a DJ and fun drinks abound. Make sure to make a reservation!There is a sushi chef but you should not think of sushi as the main event. The fish seems very fresh here, so don't play it safe! Get things like the whole grilled fish or octopus balls. I imagine you only order food you are familiar with and you might be 'underwhelmed' as some of the other reviewers mentioned. Don't fall into that trap! There is much to be enjoyed here! Great addition to the neighborhood and Pittsburgh's growing food scene."
"1.0","Ordered the special chicken biryani....the spice level was unbearable..... Could not survive more than 2 bites.... The server should not warn people that this might be their last meal...... Lost faith in Biryanis"

"2.0","Fake Indian food. Adopted for westeners's palette it deprived of spiciness and falvour you expect from genuine Indian cuisine. Presentation is nice but service is terrible. You'd better off with a generic  Indian food truck."
"5.0","This is definitely the best fried chicken in Pittsburgh. The was tender and juicy with a nice crispy coating. Don't believe others that say the spice level is hot. I had the Hot level and it was as spicy as chocolate milk. I will surely be getting the Damn Hot in my next visit."
"1.0","Went to Banksville Eat & Park on Saturday with my family.Our waitress was Bernadette . We had two bills. First she screwed up which bill went to which family. Of course this was after she already charge my account then she took both the bills again and credit my account. You would think this would be over but heck no not with Bernadette she again took my card and charged both bills on my account never ever using my brothers card. How does one do this??? All I can say I will never go back and if anyone else goes pay in cash- u will be charged 100 times if u get Bernadette -Laura I already filled out the feedback form on line and nobody got back to me -I'm happy to say that the General Manager Bob called me and my money will be refunded to me. Very Happy"

"5.0","In the area on a business trip and decided to try Kiku based solely on the good Yelp reviews. Did not disappoint. It took a while to find it inside the shopping center, but definitely worth the effort! Stepping into the restaurant from the shopping center was surreal--in a good way. Quaint, welcoming and minimalist in decor--also in a good way. Service was excellent as was the food. My colleague had seared tuna with a green salad, and I had three maki rolls. Wonderful!"
"4.0","Got take out from this place. Great indian food! Want to stop in and dine in soon. Right downtown too! Chicken tikka and Mango veggie dish were awesome! Saag paneer was on point as well!"
"5.0","Salem's in the Strip District serves up authentic Middle Eastern fare, cafeteria style. The cafeteria has long tables to enjoy your food at and you order from the line in the back. They have a pretty large menu of those Middle Eastern staples you'd expect to see, including shawarma, tikka masala, curry, gyros and tandoori, and a bunch of sweets. The market adjacent to the cafeteria has fresh butchered meats which are undoubtably used in the cafeteria, so rest assured that you're getting authentic and fresh meals no matter your choice.Goat Curry- 4.3/5I don't think i've ever had goat so i wanted to give it a shot. Not a huge fan of the meat in general. The flavor of the curry was spot-on, though.Chicken Tikka Masala- 4.5/5This stuff is really good. The sauce is near perfect, but the chicken was a tad overcooked. I typically avoid getting chicken from restaurants because it's never cooked like i like it (obviously cooked to temperature but i always feel like it's dry), but it could just be this particular batch. This is their staple dish and if you're looking for a great meal, I recommend. Spinach paneer- 4.8/5Okay. So you get a side with your meal and if you do not get this spinach, you better get back in line and redo the whole order. You can basically see the butter incorporated throughout, and what isn't good with that much butter, but wow. Just get it and agree with me, you'll see. Our total was only $21 for the goat curry and tikka masala meal, a gyro and fries, and two drinks. And the portions are immense. I can eat and I will be having this for lunch tomorrow as well. Go to Salem's and enjoy something different, or go outside of your comfort zone and try this amazing cultural cuisine. I'll be back!"
"5.0","If you order something spicy here, it comes spicy. The pumpkin curry is interesting and definitely worth a shot. Staff is very friendly and funny. They'll play with your baby while you eat."
"5.0","This is my go to restaurant for Chinese food downtown. My parents and I discovered it on a trip many years ago when I went to PPU. Their entrees are family size, so make sure you have either a) empty stomachs, or b) a friend to share the food with. Or c) space in your fridge at home for leftovers"
"5.0","This place is getting less confusing. Signs posted showing cost of entree, rice, one side and pita is $9. This time I did my research from yelp reviews and had a list of 4 things in rank order. I was only buying two meals but just in case what I wanted wasn't available. Yelpers love the burgers and I can see why, uncooked patties were thick and looked great.  If I lived here I would have tried it.  But this was going to Columbus. On my list was goat curry (or lamb curry).  Chille chicken ( or the tandoori).  Side of creamed spinach for both and one regular pita and one fired pita. Huge portion sizes.  We go out of our way and brave the crazy Pittsburgh streets to come here, this last time waiting 4 hours for them to open when we really had to return to Columbus.  Yes it is that good.  Free parking. Watch the hours Friday.  They close for prayers.  I LOVE THIS PLACE"
"5.0","A friend took me here for the best gnocchi I have ever eaten. We both chose the gorgonzola basil sauce; I added sweet baby peas and she added broccoli. We ate and ate and took home enough for dinner - it reheats really well. Clearly, whoever made that gnocchi is not a novice! Wine was half price since it was a weeknight, and the house cabernet was delicious. Service was stellar and the atmosphere is fantastic. I'd go regularly if I lived in Pittsburgh."
"1.0","If I could give this place 0 stars I would. There's are 3 people just standing in the front while we've been in the drive thru for 20 minutes, no that is not an exaggeration. Once you are on line there is no exit and you have no choice but to stay in line. This place needs a wake up call. Human sloths of the earth work here and they need to be taught basic human skills. Seriously they have no hope in life, you will all work here forever. Terrible service."
"3.0","The staff is friendly and the place is clean. That's really the only positives I have for this place unfortunately. The prices are high, the portions are small and the overall feel of the place is kinda odd. Kinda had this weird industrial yet hipster-ish feel. Not my particular scene. The quality of the food wasn't bad. It's worth a try if you're in the area but I wasn't impressed."

"2.0","Different people have different tastes. I'm positive that this is at least a 3 star establishment in general, and that for what it is, it very well may deserve 4 stars. If you really like sushi, you probably should go here. If you do not specifically enjoy sushi, this is not for you. My personal level of satisfaction with our visit weighed in at about 2 stars. My friends gave it a 3, but I'm not sure they were thinking clearly. To preface, I despise sushi. Going there was not my idea. I'd have rather eaten a balogna sandwich. I hate balogna. The other two people with me are sushi fans. Obviously, I did not order sushi. I was confident there would be some non-sushi dish on the menu that I would be more than glad to try. Wrong. I ordered Kaarage, which I was assured was fried chicken. It was made from that extra low quality ridiculously cheap chicken you can find in stores that's been compressed into the shape of a chicken breast then soaked forever in broth. The end result was very fatty deep fried chicken that tasted to me like barbecued salt. My friends, a pair of unabashed barbecued salt lovers, enjoyed the chicken. I couldn't finish it once realizing what low quality product it was made from. Please, people of Kiku, read this and stop using that chicken. One of my friends ordered the teriyaki steak and said it was alright, but nothing special. That sounded like it described what I saw. He also ordered some form of sushi, which he found to be competent. The other fellow ordered raw scallop sushi and did not enjoy it, but I don't fault the restaurant for that one bit. If you don't know for a fact that you enjoy raw scallops, you have no business ordering it and then complaining about it. For all I know, this place has the best raw scallop sushi on Earth. The sushi did look great. I have no problems believing that it is expertly prepared. Dessert looked interesting, but we skipped it on account of the presence of ice cream in everything given the fact that most of us are lactose intolerant and we were all sharing one hotel room. Moving on, the service was good - but at some point our water was refilled and acquired a bizarre seltzer-like flavor that we could not identify the source of. It wasn't enjoyable. I'd love to know how that happened. Life is so full of mystery, and Kiku is no exception."
"2.0","Food was great.  Highly recommend the burgers, especially the bleu cheese burger.  Seasoned wings with sauces on the side are good too.  However the service, if one can call it that, was so appallingly bad that it killed the whole meal.   I used to be a server so I m pretty tolerant.  But, this was unacceptable."
"5.0","Amazing burgers, cozy modern atmosphere, and great service! Can't ask for much more out of a burger joint...but wait....try the fried chicken, best in the Pittsburgh metro that I've had. Good beer and drink selection rounds out a great place to enjoy friends and a meal!"
"5.0","This was my first visit to Luke's, and I must say I was highly impressed. The service my friends and I received was top notch. Brian our server, was patient and attentive as he helped to assist with our selections. He was knowledgeable of the menu items and pairings. I ordered a cod fish sandwich and it was cooked to perfection....I mean it was absolutely delightful. It arrived with fresh cut fries, the appetizers were also delicious. I had the calamari, and spring rolls from their made-to-order sushi bar. All were well worth it. The atmosphere is pleasant. Great for a date night or family/friends gathering. I will certainly make additional visits to Luke's. Thanks for an awesome experience!"
"3.0","Nice cafe, but a little pricy for what we ordered. I ordered the French Toast and an orange juice which came out to 14 dollars. Our dishes came out very quickly and the French Toast was plated nicely. The only reason I brought up the price of the dish was because it was definitely lacking in flavor. The strawberry sweetness was overpowering. I ended up having my friends finish my dish for me because it was too sweet. Another friend of mine ordered a dish that came with potatoes and those were also lacking in flavors. On another note, the ordering staff are very kind and helpful. Cafe Raymond is a nice place to take a relative or date on the weekend, but the breakfast was lacking in flavors. Pamela's diner is cheaper and while the food is probably 'lower quality' it is tastier than Raymond's."
"3.0","I had their vegan taco here and I wasn't that impressed. The taco was only black beans, some lettuce and tomato. It was not that flavorful and very basic. I could've made it at home! The prices are pretty good but they need to start adding something new to their vegan tacos. They're just not original."
"3.0","I love going to the Strip District. it's the one place in this universe where I wouldn't shove someone out of my way for walking too slow. You just move with the crowd and surf the Strip wave! Me and my boyfriend went to Wholey's Alaskan Grille a few weeks ago and had a really great lunch! I ordered the Steel City lobster roll and my bf got crab legs. Both were so so good! The only reason why I am only giving 3 stars is because of the prices...yikes! My boyfriend only got the starter crab legs and it was pretty outrageous. I'll still go back but maybe for dinner where I can justify spending $100."
"3.0","This afternoon I went to Alexanders for lunch with some friends. We forgot that most small businesses are closed on Mondays and that's how we ended up here. I'm glad it was open. It was a nice lunch but nothing to rave about. I had a meatball hoagie, which was very tasty. My son had buttered noodles and it was a great size for a kid. He got a kids milk served in a to go soup cup with a kid. I'm having bad luck finding a place with a proper kids cup. Kind of annoying. My friends both enjoyed their meals of the Gorgonzola burger with bacon and the Gorgonzola pasta. Unfortunately, we were seated right next to the bathroom. I hate when places do that if there are spots closer to the front. I guess that's what happens when a kid is with you, I don't know. I probably won't go again, but it was decent for one meal."
"5.0","I went here with my two dads who were visiting from Greenland on Saturday and they were unimpressed with the way the place smelled and how it taste.  I liked it."
"5.0","Awesome taco shack. Just what a taco shack should look like, smell like, and feel like. Small counter to sit at and down a few tasty tacos. Flavor of the day changes frequently and it's always a great mix up of flavors. All the house tacos are fire and fresh. Only wish there was a beach outside the door instead of Carson."
"5.0","Great food, nicest waiters in the world. We had the Italian coquielle for appetizers and it was AMAZING. Their candied walnut salad is to die for. Their entries are simply superb. I highly recommend this place, it's a gem!!"
"5.0","Love this place! Lynn the bartender is awesome and a true yinzer if i ever Met one! The buffalo chicken dip is amazing and the dessert of the day always is as well!"
"4.0","I have always enjoyed going here for breakfast/brunch. In my younger years, I would go for the hotcakes. So thin, large, and crispy on the edges. Yummmyyy.I will write an update to this review...after I go to it again hopefully  next month...But if it is as good as I remember, you won't be sorry going here."
"5.0","Top late-night cheap pizza in Oakland; good pizza any time of the day. And that's the truth, Ruth."
"1.0","Worst customer service I've ever experienced in my life. I ordered 65 dollars worth of food.  First I tried to change from delivery to pick up and cancel the payment I already made and told them I'd pay when I got to the store.  They told me it would be too difficult to do  so I just had it delivered...an hour later our food was delivered.  I received a steak calzone instead of buffalo chicken and called them to let them know it was incorrect.  They told me they would have the buffalo chicken delivered so another hour passes and I finally get my buffalo chicken calzone.  They make me return the steak calzone which I had already had a couple bites of before realizing it was steak.  I thought that was strange because I knew they were just going to throw it away...so I think the ordeal is over and even though it took 2 hours to get my correct order I was only a little upset.  About 20 minutes later the manager calls me and tries telling me the calzone I sent back (which I tried as well as one of my friends and we both determined it was clearly steak) was the correct buffalo chicken. He then went on to blame me and say everything that happened was my fault.  It was unbelievable.  Not only did the mess my order up but then called to blame me for the entire thing.  I will never order from there again and will never recommend this place to anyone.  There are too many pizza places of equal or better quality on Pittsburgh to deal with this god awful service."
"3.0","Little Nipper's is a pretty good college-town kind of pizza place, designed to be quick for delivery and take-out.  The pizza is good but unremarkable; the prices are low; and the non-pizza offerings include most everything you'd want and expect from a place like this.Overall, my experiences here have been fairly unremarkable (either positively or negatively), so 3-stars seems appropriate."
"5.0","Wow. Visited the strip today and picked up some take-out for a late dinner tonight.  I will say that this was the best take out food we've ever eaten.  This was the first time we have been to Salem's (It is pronounced Sah-leems', we asked the guy.)As others have noted, it is large inside, casual, and cafeteria style.  Very basic but very clean and we will definitely eat there at some point in the future.  Selections today were all varieties of chicken and we ordered a half rotisserie chicken dinner (the chicken was gorgeous, how often can you say that about chicken???) that came with rice and veggies.  Also picked up a gyro and some spinach pies.  We shared everything, did not finish it all but tried hard because it was all absolutely delicious.  We loved it and will be back."
"3.0","You kind of get what you pay for here. It's your basic food at a basic price. I particularly like the salad bar over everything. The burgers are good as are the chicken dishes. Superburger combo for 7.99 or the Angusburger special for 10.99. Grab a piece of pie for 2.99 as of this review."
"1.0","Charged my husband $1 for a plastic cup even after we spent $45 on food and drinks. Maybe it was because we had rival baseball team stuff on and he didn't think we would be repeat customers? However, treat all customers right and let the great reviews pour in ultimately helping your business grow. Don't treat customers right and watch the negative reviews kill your business. My guess is the manager doesn't own the place either so no problem for him if it doesn't do as well as it could."
"3.0","The employees are so so nice there and were talkative. The pizza is more average but it's understandable considering the price is awesome. Great for budget pizza. I will continue to go for pizza after drinks. The pizza we got was cheese with mushrooms and we added red pepper flakes. the red pepper flakes here seemed somehow spicer than the ones i have at home-different brand i guess!"
"4.0","Cool concept with beautiful design, although the space is super small so be prepared to be very close to your neighbors. The decor is immaculate, and they have a cool open kitchen bar area where you can watch some of the food prep.The food was good, albeit pricy. It's a nice authentic Japanese izukaya addition to Pittsburgh, where most Asian restaurants somehow manage to serve a fusion menu Chinese/Japanese/Thai. Highly recommended the takuyaki and the shiitake mushroom skewer, those were by far the best things we tried. The chirashi bowl was pretty good, and let's you sample each fish shashimi in one dish. The karaage was a little disappointing, not a lot of seasoning/flavor and the steak skewer was meh. There's still lots on the menu that I want to sample! The drinks were really good and the service was flawless, which is impressive for a new restaurant. Will definitely be back, maybe for some late night eats."
"1.0","This is the 2nd time we've gone here and had a bad experience.  The first time, my husband got the fajitas.  They came out cold, gave him two small slices of pepper, and barely a chicken breast.  He asked to talk to the manager and she gave him ridiculous attitude for complaining ( he never complains at restaurants) and was unapologetic.  We decided to give it another try.  For the Pirate home opener they said the 'special' was a $5 Miller lite draft with a pirate cup.  We were still charged $5 for the special despite the restaurant not having the Pirate cup.  We asked about it (our waiter didn't even tell us) and he said 'it's been 2 months and they haven't come in yet'.  We then got our bill and were charged full price.  I would think again when going to this bar.  They have high prices for less than quality food and they have false advertising on their so-called 'drink specials'."
"5.0","Great music and atmosphere. Great spot for a cheap but great meal. Highly recommended when you are on asmall budget or any time really"
"5.0","It was a great experience, went there to celebrate my birthday with my wife. Table was decorated, food was phenomenal. Service was excellent, Greg, our server, took great care of us. Special birthday dessert with candles to blow out was on the house. An excellent dinner, highly recommended, will definitely go there again soon!"
"1.0","Worst restaurant to go in Pittsburgh! If you want to wait for for your food for more than an hour then that's the place. The hostess set us down right and it took 20 minutes for a waiter to come and get our order and drinks. I would get it if it was busy but it was almost empty! No wonder it was empty there service sucks! Then an hour passed our waiter disappeared and I had to ask another waiter for our food because my one year old was soo hungry like come on! So our food was brought but it was wrong and I had it! Wanted to talk to the manager and ask to talk to him he never showed up! No one came after  30 good minutes passed by our baby was no one came with the check out food was wrong we didn't even eat it we left! Never again! Guys don't go eat there!!!"
"1.0","I went to this awful restaurant on Sunday night and I tried to ask a guy who worked there about the menu and the owner was on the phone,  and just because he was on the phone when I was asking the other guy about the food, when the owner got off the phone he yelled at me in an abusive and nasty way and said 'youve been here before!!! You know what's on the menu!!! I told him he had no reason to talk to me in that manner and he persisted in yelling at me!  Also, 8 years ago they banned me from the store just because I changed my order! Don't eat here or order from these assholes!! They're HIGHLY unprofessional and abusive!! HORRENDOUS customer service!!!"
"5.0","If you don't come here, you made a mistake.  Stop debating and just go.  Get everything, any choice on the menu equals winning.  Wide selection, smells incredible, the constant line from people across all walks of life indicates this place's universal appeal.  Chicken shawarma crushed it.  I could eat here for a month and not regret a single choice in my life."
"4.0","Yummy food! Prices maybe a bit high but the staff are nice and the restaurant itself is cool!"
"5.0","This place is on the top of my list for the best Thai in the city. Always so consistent, very generous portions, family owned and operated, and to top it off it's VERY vegan friendly. They have a separate fryer for all their vegetables, which is pretty uncommon. The General Tso's Tofu is the best I have ever had, I can't go here without ordering it! Spring rolls are so fresh, and crab ragoons are a staple order for my boyfriend. Recently had the chili paste stir fry and the veggies were SO fresh and of quality. Not mushy or anything. They stand up and are crisp and flavorful. I seriously dream about General Tso's tofu and have to satisfy the craving every so often. Nothing comes close to their dish! They also have awesome lunch specials and now offer delivery. Prices are very affordable, especially for the portion sizes and quality of food. Love supporting this restaurant whenever I can. They are also BYOB, added bonus!"
"5.0","great sandwich and service. good price for the sandwich size too. half way through and i'm already full lol"
"5.0","The plain exterior hides something amazing inside. The food is consistently delicious. I regularly crave their wonton soup! Their lunch special is a great deal! Their service is wonderful. They are friendly and take good care of you!"
"5.0","I'm obsessed and I've never even set foot in the store! I've only ordered delivery, but all I know is that they offer up some delicious food. You know it's good when you crave it.My go to right now is the Pangea Bowl which is rice, avocado, black beans, corn, tomatoes and this fiery BBQ sauce I could probably pour over everything for the rest of my life and be fine with.This last time I also tried a Recoverii smoothie and it was just as good as it sounded with coconut milk and mango. I'm sure I'll be ordering again soon, I just need to switch it up and try something different!"
"5.0","I came to Caffe Mona on a weekday during the summer, and sat on the back patio. It was really tranquil and lovely - I sat, read my book, and enjoyed a savory mushroom crepe for lunch. It's small and cozy, and it kind of seems family-run, which only further endears itself to me. I don't know what it's like on a weekend (possibly much busier), but on a weekday during the summer, it was just what I needed."
"3.0","I can only speak for the takeout. I ordered while staying in a nearby hotel on business and was hungry after a long day and a run outside afterwards. It was average but considering it cost $28 for chicken Parmesan with a third-party ordering system I was not too impressed because the quality was just average. I asked for spaghetti with my chicken Parm but I received a penne and the sauce was just tossed on top of bare pasta so I had to mix it up when I received it.  I am glad I also asked for crush read and Parmesan cheese because the marinara sauce was very bland similar to Classico tomato sauce out of the jar. I wonder how the other dishes are but likely wouldn't reorder again."
"5.0","I can't say enough good things about Sausalido.  The meal was absolutely delicious.  My husband had the special (Salmon Oscar) and it was amazing and I had the crab cakes and they were fantastic.  We both agreed that the portions were very generous.  Also, the staff was so warm and welcoming during our visit.  I already can't wait to go back!"
"5.0","We love this place. If you stick to the 'safe stuff' on the menu, like a margherita pizza, you'll be underwhelmed. Go for the risottos, the specialty pizzas, and the salumi platter, which we think rivals Cure's in taste though not cost! We like sitting at the bar and watching the cooks for a casual meal. There's usually not a super long wait for a table, and if there is the rooftop bar is great too."
"5.0","A hidden gem in the city. I've been here now twice and loved everything about this restaurant both times. I sat at the bar in front of the kitchen area on both visits and enjoyed watching the process of the chefs prepping and cooking such unique food. Although I would love to go back and sit at one of the tables tucked down into the floors, I very much enjoyed the show of cooking that came with our seats. You surely don't feel like you're in Pittsburgh anymore once you climb the flights of stairs to get to this uniquely decorated restaurant. From our cocktails, to our appetizer skewers, to our entrees.. everything was delicious. But by far my favorite thing is the savory pancake on the appetizer menu. I don't know the legitimate name for it but it says 'savory pancake' underneath of it's actual name and that's all I needed to see to order it. The pancake ingredients changed from one visit to the next, but I can't tell you which was better because they were both so. good. I can't wait to go back to consume another one. Our second favorite thing were the bacon wrapped quail egg skewers. Another thing not to miss! Everything we ate had such great flavor combinations, and the staff was so helpful and pleasant on top of it."
"5.0","I love this place so much! It's my favorite hot chicken place. I don't even live close and I'll go down for any reason to pick up some chicken! I get the medium spice and my children get the southern. We usually get the strips but I had the sandwich which was good too. Maybe next time I'll go spicier!!"
"5.0","One of the best steaks in the city! I cane here following our small family wedding. Maria, our waitress, was absolutely wonderful. She made us feel very welcome, and addressed us as the 'the new wife and groom.' The steaks were better than any I have had in the city so far (and much better than Morton's). All the filets and NY strips were cooked to the perfect temperature and the sides (asparagus and potatoes ) were top notch.When we thought we were done with out meal, Maria brought us out a congratulatory desert of cheesecake and espresso cake. I think that night I was still dreaming about the cheesecake!Then, the final touch, As we were about to leave Maria again congratulated us, and gave my beautiful wife a fresh rose. I have never seen service so good it brought my new wife to tears until last night.This is an expensive treat, but you get what you pay for. Maria, I hope you see this, or someone mentions it to you. You made our unorthodox wedding day very special, and we will be back to see you soon"
"5.0","Cafe Mona was great! I went to visit my friends for the weekend and boy let me tell you!! This place was a great call. it looked like a secret spot at first because I am not that familiar with Pittsburgh, haha!! The food was great. We had pretty much everything on the menu, we were a group of 6 and we love sharing. Also, coffee was fabulous as well! We had black coffee which was served well and they were really good with refilling our coffee at no extra charge. More importantly, the staff was really friendly and service was casual, fun, and fast!!! We got to meet and talk to everybody works there. YES!!! the staff was that amazing!We also sat outside and enjoyed our brunch. I still can't get over how cute & fabulous their outdoor patio is. Highly recommended!! This place is easily getting a 5 star."
"4.0","If you're in the mood for a sandwich this is one of the best places on campus, because of their variety. However, if you go later in the day as I tend to do, they are often out of many choices."
"1.0","this is the worst taco bell ever do not patronize i sat blocked in their drive thru last night for 40 min after repeating my order 6x to the cashier who obviously didn't care about any customers who has to repeat 6x....then i finally get to the window and my large order isn't ready yet so i asked for a manager was told he went outside i cancelled my order drove around the building to find a manager smoking a cigarette while talking on his cellphone...seriously my money spends anywhere and it won't be here"
"5.0","Let me start off by saying Ryan and Dylan (my two bartenders) are probably the nicest guys ever.  They were super nice and friendly.  So easy to talk to.  I felt like I've know them forever.   They made me laugh and were super attentive.  This bar is so nice to go to to just have a relaxing conversation.  I will come to this place time and time again.   If I could give it more stars I would."
"3.0","As stated in my tip we went to Redbeard's on 6th after seeing a great play at the Pittsburgh Public Theater.  First time there and the place was pretty busy.  They have an upstairs and a downstairs bar and some tables on both levels too.  The hostess suggested we try upstairs as it wasn't as busy.  And it wasn't so we easily got a seat.  The place is nice, I can't complain about the décor.  They also had many beers on draft including crafts, and like a broken record I ordered me a Southern Tier IPA... It was glorious.  We looked over the menu for a while and I decided on a Ball Park Burger, cooked pink added jalapenos to it, and the vegetable of the day for the side.  The H got a flat bread they made special as a BBQ chicken one.  The bartender seemed really nice, and pretty attentive.  As we waited for our food to come the upstairs started to get busier and busier, which also includes louder and drunker.  I can't exactly blame the bar for this but I absolutely can't stand someone putting their hand on the back of my chair, putting their foot on the foot rest and squeezing in every five minutes to order 5 crazy shots for him and his drunk friends!  So there was that.  How fun is it to eat with a stranger leaning on you????  Yea it ain't.  So some more time passes and someone from the kitchen comes out to tell me they don't have any more vegetables.  Ok so I got the slaw, no biggy, so about 5 minutes later our food comes out.  The burger tasted good but alas they forgot the bacon on the burger! I am now kind of fighting to get the bartenders attention due to the spike in the rowdy, young, drunk crowd.  I asked nicely, 'Isn't this supposed to have bacon on it?'  She rolled her eyes and said 'yea let me guess they forgot?'  ding, ding, ding, and the winner goes to... Yea so anyhow she brings the bacon and I only ate  1/2 because I am trying to eat smaller portions, you know swimsuit season is right around the corner...  Well it was a good thing I only ate  1/2 cause my H was still really hungry.  The flatbread was small not a great size, and I usually get flatbread envy when he orders them, but not this time.  We were getting ready to leave and got our check.  I was a little upset they charged $.75 for me to add jalapenos when they almost stiffed me on bacon, and didn't have the side I ordered and didn't know it until 15 minutes after I ordered.  We scooped ourselves up and left.Summary, food was ok, nothing spectacular.  Cool bar, nice bartender, but I am over being sandwich in my stool by a bunch of hammered college students... Though I'm not too old to recall how many moons ago, I was but one of them..."
"5.0","Fast service, great meals, and cheap prices. This is definitely the best Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. I don't even go anywhere else."
"5.0","Went to Luke's on a date night! It was very good! I had the yum yum roll! It was delicious! My boyfriend got the steel city lobster roll and loved it! We also got the calamari which was amazing! I would recommend any of these three dishes! The service here was also awesome! Our waiter was always there when we needed something. The waiter also informed us that there is 25% off sushi so we will be back for that for sure! The restaurant has some under the sea / deep sea fishing  vibes to it and also had patio seating for summer months!"
"4.0","Great place to ruin your diet, totally worth the calorie free fall! Great hot cakes, great potatoes. Stick with breakfast and you cannot go wrong.  Unless you prefer things like wheatgrass.  Then, not so much."
"5.0","I'll admit this, I've had Tony's pizza about 5/6 times and I've ordered the same thing every time because I love it so much. The Firehouse Chicken Flatbread Pizza. It has the ranch dressing , chicken, cheddar cheese and banana peppers . So good!!   Tony is very passionate about his food and takes pride in his product. Love you Tony !!!!"
"5.0","This is my favorite place to eat in Oakland, but it also may be the 'broke college kid' vibe. Food is inexpensive but still really good. Definitely get the wings or their hoagies."
"5.0","Love this place! Quick service and huge portions! 3 chicken fingers lasts me 2 whole meals! The sauce is to die for."
"5.0","Just moved to the area, and I immediately had to try this place out. The staff are friendly, and give great suggestions. I had the Hammertime sandwich and the Peach Apple Cobbler cold specialty tea blend. This place is definitely a hidden gem!"
"3.0","I was super excited to try out this new spot in Bloomfield - It looks cute inside and also has a couple outdoor tables. But - I don't think I would go back. It is a Portuguese restaurant, however, the food really just tasted American to me.. It just wasn't 'different enough' as lame as that sounds. Maybe it's what we ordered, but it was a let down."
"5.0","Best place to go for handcrafted drinks. The bartenders really know what they're doing. I enjoy the fact that there isn't a tv.  It really helps people communicate more! The board games are a fun addition. Their Mac and cheese is delicious!"
"5.0","Aaah, Hardee's!!  There were so many Hardee's around back in the day, and now there is just this one last survivor in, of all places, Millvale!  Went there a number of years ago, loved it, and promptly forgot about it.  A couple weeks back, my niece and I were in the area with 2 teenage girls--God help us!--on a quest for prom dresses, and suddenly--like an oasis in the desert--there was the Hardee's!!!  And oh, yes, still the best fast food anywhere!!  Thick, juicy burgers, crisp fries, great chicken sandwiches!  The city's a better place with Hardee's in it, and I hope it never leaves!"
"5.0","This is a wonderful restaurant in the heart of downtown Pittsburgh. It's not cheap, but the food was excellent, especially the brussell sprouts. Stopped there on way to a show, and since it was pouring out, they gave us an umbrella.  A very nice one, at that."
"5.0","Stopped in here for breakfast on a Sunday morning after some other local places were completely packed - I was pleasantly surprised! You walk in and place your order at the counter, then are given a number to put at your table (or someone comes and gives you a table number while you're waiting in line).Probably took ~10-15mins max for our food to come, and it was delicious. Would highly recommend the ricotta blueberry pancake - one came with my meal, but if I go back and get a different menu item I will likely add one on. Bathrooms are downstairs (customers only), and very clean. They have an elevator to an upper deck as well, but we didn't check it out. Would definitely return!"
"5.0","Solid Bloomfield spot, great food, and good service too. I'm happy to come here occasionally for a decent meal."
"1.0","Hard pass on this place in the future. Stopped in here hoping to find some delicious corned beef, just after picking up my daughter a slice of pizza from up the street. Even mentioned that, as I was placing my order. It was only after we payed for my food & our drinks, a guy comes over & says they don't allow other peoples food in their establishment. I honestly thought the guy was joking! He wasn't. I told him that would've been nice to know before purchasing my entree. He said, you should've asked!.. Zero offers of making a to-go order, nada. I had to ask for that! By the time I got my order ready to go it was cold. I definitely feel this was shady business & bad corned beef!! Definitely look elsewhere for a better taste of both."
"1.0","The delivery guy was really rude when he showed up and provided over all poor customer service.  The pizza was horrible sauce running off .  I asked for extra cheese and its like they put stew sauce. Whatever was in the little clear cup was spilled and made the pizza soggy.  Overall I wouldn't recommend unless you want soggy wrong orders with horrible customer service"
"5.0","This place is an excellent spot in Bloomfield. Went here tonight, they were semi-busy for a Wednesday night. The restaurant space is nothing too exciting but seemed clean. They are a BYOB so plan accordingly. The service was fantastic and everything came out very quick. We started with the spring rolls which were very good. I then had the Pad Thai which is usually what I get when I try a new Thai place (I'm pretty vanilla). Their's was probably the best I've had in Pittsburgh. They do spice from 1-10, their 8/10 definitely had more of a kick than other 8/10s. It's a good portion size. The prices are better than comparable places as well. Overall, great food and service, will definitely be back."
"4.0","Real food, real good. We ordered a couple breakfast dishes (thank you for serving breakfast all day):1) The smoked salmon platter which came with FOUR slices of smoked salmon, bread (it normally comes with ciabatta but I got wheat toast), cream cheese, cucumber, tomato, capers, and red onion. 2) The Guys's breakfast: two eggs scrambled with cheese, potatoes, a wonderfully fluffy blueberry ricotta pancake, and a meat (which we subbed out for another egg, but really we got something like four total).What made this meal fantastic was that we were kind of able to share the dishes and combine the smoked salmon with eggs (one of my fave combos). The eggs were good although not incredibly flavorful, same with the toast. Quality salmon, and perfect spice on the potatoes. The blueberry pancakes were fluffy and delicious topped off with 100% pure, local maple syrup. Our meal was a a bit pricey but we got a ton of food and really enjoyed ourselves. A really great option for (all-day) breakfast in the strip."
"4.0","Staying in Pittsburgh for the night and walked down the street looking for breakfast. A woman walking her dog overheard us and recommended Pamela's. Done! Everyone had a great meal. The sides of Lyonnaise potatoes are amazing and the crepes looked great, too."
"4.0","This is definitely a go-to place anytime I'm in Pittsburgh.Cool place with a chill vibe.  Staff has always been friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.Almost all of their menu sounds delicious. But like a drug, I can't seem to stay away from the Steel City Lobster Roll (Chunks of cold water lobster meat, sauteed in garlic butter, served on a bun with fresh cut seasoned fries, smothered with house made lobster bisque and creme fraiche). But unlike other seafood places, Wholey's does NOT skimp on the meat...large pieces of whole lobster claw meat! And the lobster bisque they cover the sandwich with is great. I love when they give you a bit extra so you can dip your fries in it too.Some day I'll try something else (having only ever had this sandwich is why I only gave 4 stars), but for now the Steel City Lobster Roll keeps me coming back on its own."
"5.0","Best Indian food in Pittsburgh. Cannot stop myself from going there again and again and again and again and again...... :-)"
"3.0","Sausalido. Hmm... I feel torn about you! If I could give it 3.5 stars, I would have. The service is good, and the owner (I believe his name is Nick) flits about the restaurant, helping to seat people, serve food, and just generally chat with customers and see how their meals are going. I love that! But, of course, this is a restaurant, so on to the food...I've had dishes here that are great, and I've had dishes that leave me thinking I should have just stayed home and cooked. The good? Well, the bread they give you at the beginning with their homemade dipping sauce is awesome. I just had to pause while writing this, because I wasn't sure what to call the 'sauce'. It's actually an interesting concoction that consists of a homemade hummus that tastes like a combo of chickpeas and peppers, and it's drizzled with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and some chopped tomatoes. Regardless, it's delicious, and the bread is always soft and fresh. Also noteworthy: the mussels in coconut curry sauce. You will be asking for more bread to sop up that sauce! The mussels are perfectly tender, and the sauce is plentiful and oh-so-flavorful. The onion rings, as mentioned in other reviews, are pretty great too. The 'eh'? I haven't had a main dish here that has resulted in another tally on my Clean Plate Club card. I was here for NYE when they had a limited menu (like many restaurants) and I had the steak. It was okay. Nothing to write home about. Last time I was here, I had the porkchop and my boyfriend had the fish. My porkchop did have a nice herbed butter on top that definitely was the star of the dish. Despite the fact that the porkchop was perfectly cooked, if that herbed butter hadn't been spread all over its surface, it would have been Bland City. The chop was on a bed of sweet potato hash, but I really didn't find it to be too complementary to the pork and butter. My boyfriend's fish was on a bed of quinoa that he thought was decent, but he, like myself, wound up leaving quite a bit on his plate, despite being super hungry upon arrival. Oh, and he went with the wedding soup (they call it something fancier-sounding on the menu) instead of a salad, but it was pretty bland, and there was a lot of fresh spinach leaves in it that hadn't really cooked down as much as they should have, which was kinda... weird. All in all, I'd go back (especially because I live like 2 minutes away), but I'll just stick with sharing a few apps instead of ordering main dishes next time!"
"5.0","Located on the second floor above Emporio the meatball joint, it could be considered a step up in more ways than one. We were here for restaurant week, and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the restaurant week menu features the same dishes as the regular menu. Same size, just a few less options. For RW you get an appetizer, main and dessert for a set price. I think it was $35pp. The popular choices were Lobster pappardelle pasta for a starter and either the bone-out pork chop or shrimp fra Diablo for the main. I went with the pasta for both, which was only a minor mistake only because I couldn't finish it all. Both were generous servings. Honestly I could have stopped after the appetizer and left full, especially because we added the charcuterie board before ordering. The Lobster pasta was fantastic. I couldn't believe how much Lobster was in there! The pasta was phenomenal. Onto the main, the pasta was like a shell shape in a red sauce and the shrimp was plentiful. Dessert was a scoop of vanilla ice cream with peaches in a crepe. Very nice. I would definitely recommend this place and will return!"
"2.0","Typically I order from Ephesus Pizza (they are amazing!) but this time I gave Genoa a shot. It unfortunately was bad. I'm giving it 2 stars, as I think a 1 star review is reserved for those who find sanitary issues (bugs, hair, etc) or something pretty heinous. I'll give you a play by play:1) Delivery driver gets here. He calls as they typically do, and I walk outside. He is sitting in his car in the middle of the street and continues to sit there. I literally had to walk barefoot to his drivers side door to get my food.2) I ordered fries, 2x gyros and a large pizza. I open up the fries and they are soggy as all hell. Now, fries are tricky. Most restaurants poke holes in the box to let the steam escape so they don't get super gross. This restaurant did not.3) I open the gyros up and they are sooooo soggy from the grease off the gyro meat. It's wet and slimy and pretty gross feeling. I pull out the tzatziki and it's fully separated. This means it was made (lord knows when), portioned off in portion cups and thrown in the fridge. Then the waters separate from the dairy fats. It's not bad, it just looks bad. What was bad though, was the lettuce on the gyro. It was soggy (probably from mixing with the hot grease from the gyro meat) and it was brown and tasted awful.4) I open the pizza, hoping that it would redeem the poor quality of the meal, and it's lukewarm at best. This is within 5 minutes of it being dropped off. I was so disappointed. Flavor was ok (it was chicken and bacon), but the crust is that generic crappy dough that you find at any hotel delivery pizza place like Pizza Mia, Pizza Palermo, Pizza Parma, Pizza Perfectta....you get the idea. Never am I going to order from here again. Issues across the board, so I highly doubt it was a one time situation. I'm definitely going back to Ephesus as my go-to. They are fantastic with many many more wonderful options. Can you say 'dry plum chicken pizza'? Because it's the best."
"1.0","I've ordered delivery for Peppi's twice.  Both times, I've gotten cold food.  Today, not only were the fries limp and cold, but my steak sandwich had sausage in it.  I also asked for no lettuce or tomato and it had both.  Either they gave me someone else's order, or they didn't give a darn.  Won't be ordering from them again."
"2.0","the service was great.the people were friendly.the food? look, i dont want to be a jerk here, but, greasy and really not that appetizing food was had here.i know these places can be hit or miss but, not, it wasn't to my liking. The MSG? it was there in full force.I am on a mission to find a decent Chinese lunch place now."
"5.0","Excellent food! Had a veggie burger that wife really loved, and a Maggie's Farm Burger. Also the rosemary french fries. Good craft beer selection too! The only negative was lack of acoustic material in the area...hard floors, walls and ceilings and only took a 3/4 full crowd to make the voices deafening!"
"5.0","So good. Highly suggest the carnitas and a side of chips and queso, the queso is super spicy and absolutely delicious"
"5.0","Great Burgers and atmosphere! All fresh organic farm to table burgers. Got the Maggie's farm burger which came with rum aioli, chilies, caramelized onions, and smoked gouda. Mac and cheese was delicious too. Friendly staff with quick service, and the owner even comes out to check on his customers. Will be back plenty of times in the near future."
"4.0","Okay holy crap, this place gives you HUGE portions. I didn't even eat half of my food and I'm full. This place is Mediterranean and Indian inspired and it's really good! I ordered tandoori chicken which had basmati rice and a side salad. It was tasty and a nice amount of spicy. The potion was incredible! I also got a side of grape leaves which were cold and I love them that way. They were basic but good. The baba ganouj was good but I've had better. I like mine a bit less bitter. And the veggie samosa was DELISH. I would definitely get more of those. All and all, I'll order from here again and try something new because I feel it would all be good!"
"5.0","Holy moly, they really blew my expectations out of the water.  We ordered the beef with pierogies and brussels sprouts, the not so French dip sandwich and the schnitzel sandwich.  The beef was melt in your mouth tender, the Brussels sprouts were perfectly crispy and flavorful, every single sauce was mind blowingly good, the pierogies were so creamy on the inside and delicious. Omg I could go on forever.  We talked for a while with the owners and it was obvious how much they really care and have truly thought about every single element on each plate.  We got some other dishes from the other restaurants in Smallman as well but Sultry's dishes were by far the highlight and I'll definitely be going back.  If you haven't been yet, you have to check them out!"
"5.0","As soon as you walk in here the smell of butter and deliciousness is amazing. The chocolate croissant was phenomenal. It felt like I really was in a French bakery; everything looked so delightful and tasty. Plan to walk there so you can load up on more candy goodness"
"5.0","I get the Joey Porter steak and portabellas it's under $10 and very filling I also see they have fresh FF. There is street parking put it can Be tough on the weekends. I love the fresh soft bread. If your in the area you definitely need stop. There's not a lot of seating"
"4.0","my favorite thai place in pittsburgh, i've been here quite a few times but i always order the same dish, the pumpkin curry is good, i hear the duck curry is amazing.  This place is a really relaxed kitschy thai restaurant with eclectic decor and good food."
"3.0","Unless you have been here before, you would probably have trouble finding the place like we did. A family member wanted to try it. It was hard to find and a little small within station square.The service was alright . It was somewhat crowded . I like sushi and the selection was not that great. It was very basic, shrimp tempura roll, salmon avocado, California roll, and spicy tuna roll are the rolls we ordered. They were smaller with 6 pieces each. The pricing was comparable for those rolls at other places. The best thing I ordered was the miso soup with crab meat. We didn't have any issues of any kind, I just feel like the sushi was basic and small for my taste. I would not return here again."
"3.0","A wide variety of selections on the menu, with pretty efficient service (about 15 minutes). I had the seafood pizza, which toppings wise, was incredible, but the crust and cheese were average. Also had the cheesy bread which was overpriced as it was mostly bread with a minimal amount of cheese, but it was slightly healthier in that it was less greasy than pizza chains like Domino's."
"3.0","I use to love this place.  I have only been here late at nights on Fridays and Saturdays. This was my to go spot but the food has really lost its flavor. Ive only tried the chicken tacos on a soft shell and I really liked it the first few times but now its just blah.  I got the loaded nachos recently and its nothing special. The prices are fair and the service is relatively fast.  This place is open late until 3am Friday and Saturday so thats a major plus. Some nights there is a line out the door which can be a downer. If you order tacos they wont give you a to go container which can be annoying but they have aluminum foil to wrap it up."
"4.0","I stopped by last Fri. for lunch with a friend.  Those of you who follow my reviews know my general disdain for the pathetic lunch options available in Oakland, but occasionally, the need to have lunch at a local establishment arises, this being one of those times.  For those occasions, I keep a list of bookmarks of local lunch spots I haven't tried handy, and Beta Bites was the next such bookmark on my list.For lunch, I ordered the chicken sharmola sandwich (I think it was a little over $7), and my friend ordered the salad with Moroccan chicken.  The sandwich came with fries and was quite large for the price (about a foot long, I believe), such that I could only finish half of it at one sitting.  It consisted of chicken, greens, bell peppers, and some kind of sauce similar to Thousand Island dressing.  While the chicken was nicely seasoned and the sauce added some flavor, I didn't find the sub super flavorful.  Upon eating the other half the next day, the addition of some whole grain mustard upped the flavor ante, improving it.While I didn't try my friend's salad, the chicken appeared to be similarly seasoned, and the salad itself was quite large.  It came with a yogurt-based dressing that was green in color, which the cashier informed us was due to the inclusion of fresh parsley.  My friend said it was one of the best salads she's had recently, and she enjoyed it very much.Unlike many local establishments that do most of their business via delivery, counter service was friendly and attentive, which was nice.  Prices were very reasonable, esp. given portion sizes, which is important for any eatery where a high proportion of customers are college students.  While I felt that the sub could have been more flavorful, I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt with a 4 star rating due to my friend's assessment of the salad, the service, the price:portion ratio, and the relative uniqueness for the area. Check it out and see what you think!"
"4.0","Doce is No Nonsense, and they have a straight-forward approach to tacos: Ultra-fresh, quality ingredients = Amazing Tacos. You won't even mind the lack of octopus or duck confit, promise. The short but solid menu is well thought out and includes a daily special for those who shun conformity. These are exceptional tacos for the price. And the people who work here are cool as a cucumber (topped with fresa cheese, for good measure.)"
"5.0","This is a great little shop. They have goat rodeo cheese! They also have sandwiches, which I'm excited to try next time I'm back. The selection is not huge, but they have some nice basics. I got some sesame crackers along with the cheese. They had an interesting selection of dried beans as well."
"4.0","I really don't get all the hate that this places gets.  What brought us in was the offer they had on Group on.  Anyway I am a bit picky about India food because I really am not a fan of spicy food. However, I was not disappointed.We parked a couple of blocks as this establishment does not have parking. Since we came in on a Sunday evening it was a little empty when we arrived. We were immediately seated in the table of our choice and provided waters right away. Ordered samosas which were pretty tasty for appetizers. For the entree I opted for lamb saag, with no spice. My husband when for the chicken mango curry. I will say that the saag was not spicy and I was able to enjoy it, which is something that is hard to find and the main reason that I dont go to Indian restaurants that frequently. My husbands had a bit of a kick but was quite flavorful. We were provided with some delicious garlic naan and a large helping of rice which was refilled upon request. In addition to the food, I ordered some mango lassis which were outstanding. Anyway overall the decor is nothing to write home about, but the food and the service are definitely on point and would def check them out again if I am in the area."
"4.0","The burgers are better than BRGR or Burgatory and they have a better attitude for the same price. I had the Polish burger (with a pierogie).  Fries are thin and well-salted, not greasy or soggy.  It's clean, fresh, and friendly.  I like the mix of all floral plates and miscellaneous pint glasses.  The hostess and server were helpful.  I used a Groupon, but would go back and pay full price any time."
"5.0","This is the most delicious food in Pittsburgh. So good, we even had them cater for our wedding. Favorites include: Chili Chicken, Chicken Tikka Masala, Falafel, and oddly, their fries! So good!"
"5.0","This place is really convenient, near a lot of apartments and is a really good local pizza joint. They're open late on Friday and Saturday and they're on campusfood! And they have good prices too! What more could you want?"
"4.0","I got a sub from Bella Notte just down the street from Peppi's and I will never do that again! Bella Notte puts about one slice of each kind of meat and a bare minimum of toppings on a lot of bread, while Peppi's absolutely stuffs their subs with meat and toppings. The best is the Franco, which is an Italian sub. It really hits the spot and is plenty big enough for two hungry adults to share. Bella Notte is for pizza. Peppi's is for subs."
"1.0","Not fresh at all I don't know why, but the restaurant delivered really bad food to our table. The other tables have fresh sushi, sashimi, etc."
"4.0","Although the service was excellent, our party was disappointed in the steaks. For the price, we had expected a much more tender steak even though the temperature was as we had ordered."
"5.0","The service here is fantastic.  I commend the kitchen on the hangar steak.  The atmosphere is nice as well.  It's elegant yet unpretentious. Anna really took care of us, as did Mike, the bartender."
"5.0","On point.From the hostess, to the waiter, to the rest of the wait staff, to the décor, to the food and the wine, this place was on point.You can't go wrong with a bottle of merlot, oysters on the half shell, a porterhouse, a filet mignon, lobster mac & cheese and roasted mushrooms, followed by berries with fresh cream, a cappuccino and a sambuca.  On point and all aces."
"5.0","Dear Craft Work,   Thank you for ruining my entire life. I just purchased a breakfast wrap from your establishment called 'old school.'  This wrap was so delicious that I now know that I will be forced to eat this wrap every morning for the rest of my natural life. In fact, I have decided to start taking the T to work just so I can swing by every morning with ease and pick up one of these tastastic breakfast bonanzas. This wrap is all I can think about and I have billable hours so this is now a huge problem. I have to go now before I get fired and can no longer afford this mouth treat."
"3.0","We ordered from this place because the prices were very good, they have a lot of options, and we wanted to try a place we haven't had before.  Delivery arrived on time and ordering was easy.  The pizza, however, had some disgusting crab meat on it.  I did not order crab meat and thankfully I'm not allergic!!  It smelled like rotting crab and tasted the same.  Gross!  Aside from that, the pizza was pretty average; nothing special, but good.  Probably will try other places..."
"1.0","Got here after a 6 hour bus ride and was starving so I call Genoa's what ended up being a total of 4 times to be passed around the phone and hung up on.... also 4 times. Never got my order placed over the phone. Saw the same place on here and placed an order only to receive less than what I ordered! :)Asked for a calzone w ricotta, mozzarella, pineapple & sauce on the side (literally wrote this in the comments in caps since we don't have any.....). What we got was a calzone w a dollop of ricotta in a ball in the middle with no sauce!! :))Connection sucks where I am and the driver texts me but it doesn't come through and pulls up a few houses down then gets offended that we didn't tell him there was a dog when he sees my dog on the porch where I pretty much just spat back 'yup.' Guy gets in his car and angrily holds his horn down while he's driving by the house after making a u-e lmaoEasily one of the most karmically hilarious situations I've been in in a while. Sufficed to say I will never be ordering from here again on my trips to Pittsburgh and I don't generally recommend others do either. :////"
"4.0","A good place to go for authentic tasting Indian food. Went there on a couple of occasions, the latest was a weekday buffet.Food taste was spot on, except for a chicken dish that felt like the chicken had been marinated for days and felt old. Other wise genuinely good location and good food. Worth visiting!"
"3.0","Went here for lunch today and it was good! I got a cheese steak with fries and drink. It's was pretty standard fries were kind of bland. I liked the cheesesteak tho! May be returning!"
"5.0","Amazing!!!  Everything from appetizers to desserts are so delicious!!  We usually reserve the capital grille for special occasions!  Two of our favorite servers are Tiffany and Maria and they are the best!!!  I highly recommend this place for a great dinner or a special night out!"
"5.0","I really liked this place. The woman explained it all to me pretty well, so I wasn't lost in the sauce going through the order line. The pizza came out quickly and was surprisingly delicious. It wasn't burnt, and wasn't undercooked. Seriously cooked to perfection.They need to do better on the fountain drink choices though."
"4.0","This was my second time here and neither time disappointed. Quite honestly I can't grasp the three stars. They are certainly inconveniently located as far as parking and the price is really good but doesn't stand out, still the food is really good! The buffet has a lot of options both meat and vegetarian and Ive had some of the most prompt and friendly service in Oakland every time I'm here. Let's also add a plug in for the chai tea carafe ....yummmm! My friend noticed that the buffet seemed to be missing some classic Indian staples and I will add that I wasn't married to the taste of any of the desserts and wish the naan was unlimited with the buffet (though an order does still come with your food) but the portion was still perfect. I'd say it's a stop worth making!"
"4.0","Having recently moved from Hawaii, where there are tons of great asian restaurants, I am on the hunt for good Japanese food.  Kiku is about as good as I've found in the area, and it is quite good.  I felt it was a bit pricey, but I'm willing to spend some $$$ if the food is good, and the food is good here.  I've had the Chirashi, several types of rolls, and the tonkatsu.  So far, everything is good.  The sushi was fresh, the tonkatsu battered light and crispy.  Our server, Masako, gave good recommendations, and the sushi chef was entertaining to talk to as well."
"4.0","So a friend and I went to Alexander's because it was the closest restaurant to his place and we didn't feel like driving on the snow-covered roads.  I didn't have high expectations - I thought I would get standard Italian fare with nothing special while also probably paying too much.  From the get go I was wrong!The decor and ambiance isn't upscale but it also isn't terrible.  It feels like a down home, mom and pop type of restaurant.  It sort of reminded me of a place that Tony and his crew would eat at in 'The Sopranos' - good food and cool ownership.  When we entered, it looked like the owner was chatting it up with some regulars.  Seeing us, he warmly greeted us and introduced us to our waitress.  Before I get to the food a note on the service.  Our waitress was great - super friendly, helping us with any questions, and checking up on us during our meal just enough to feel taken care of but not intrusive by any means.  I could tell this wasn't her first rodeo.The food was spot on.  Along with our menus, we got a basket full of fresh Italian bread and butter.  The bread was standard white but it was moist and tasted very fresh.  But you know how it is - don't fill up on bread!  Perusing the menu, they had a lot of variation which I love - chicken marsala, spaghetti, etc but the chicken parmigiana sandwich was calling my name.  It came on hearty bread strong enough to hold the sandwich and not fall apart.  The best part was the chicken which was crispy!  It came with what tasted like homemade sauce and cheese.  It's a simple meal but very tasty - you bite into it and first get the slightly sweet sauce and cheese then the hearty chicken.  Mmmm.The sandwich was around $9 and it came with fries.  A very good and hearty meal.  I look forward to trying some of the other options at Alexanders the next time around!"
"4.0","Pastrami sandwich with slaw was very good. Lady making food is not very patient with out of towners like me who are unfamiliar with the menu. Bartender heard my order wrong and poured two beers I didn't really want. 'Oh, sorry' was the reply. Whatever, we drank them anyway. Good food and beer prices, simple atmosphere. I'd eat/drink here again."
"3.0","We randomly came to this place with the intent of having couple of tacos but we ended up having an early dinner here since the tacos were so tasty. The place is pretty small so come here early to ensure that you don't have to wait too long!"
"5.0","Great Pittsburgh Steak Salad & Wings. Waiter George was great with the kids. Can't wait to go back."
"3.0","Cool bar and restaurant.  Be prepared to wait a while for your order to be taken and food to be served!!  Once served the food is pretty good.  Love the oysters!Price is reasonable for seafood.  Employees are super friendly!"
"5.0","Arnold's has been such a wonderful addition to E. Ohio street! They have an awesome selection of teas but I mostly come for the delicious sandwiches! The owner, Verna, is so sweet and you can tell she truly loves the neighborhood and wants to provide excellent service. The space has a really cool vibe and I've seen lots of events here. I would highly recommend the Happy Turkey club, the Pear Arugula Salad, or the breakfast sandwich!! They are all seriously delicious. This is an awesome community spot on the north side and I am so happy to have it in the neighborhood!"
"3.0","I've tried their pizza, hoagies, and fries. They are alright. I wouldn't go back for pizza or hoagie.But try their bbq wings! It's delicious. I love their bbq sauce."
"4.0","The gyros and shawarmas are pretty good over here. Some of the best we've had in Pittsburgh. If you didn't come for gyros/sandwiches, they have a good spread of Indian (south Asian) dishes on the menu. The taste is good..nothing exceptional. I am a huge fan of biriyani and one complaint I have about their biriyani is that often times they use too much ghee. Overall, definitely recommend you try it at least once."
"4.0","I almost don't want to review Cafe Raymond for fear it will get more popular, but I think it's time. Part of the charm is that you usually can get right in and grab a table either inside or outside immediately. And if you sit outside you can even bring your pup! I've enjoyed this cafe for years but especially recently it's become a staple location when I'm going out to breakfast or lunch. All of the items I've tried have been great. They don't have just standard cafe fare like you might expect, they somehow elevate everything to the next level. Breakfast sandwiches are huge and my family has compared the croissants to ones they had in France. The smoked salmon platter is fresh and a hearty serving of lox. For lunch I usually get the nicoise salad - so many toppings! - and my boyfriend loves the muffaletta sandwich. But everything else we've had is good as well!My strong advice - skip the greasy diners in the area and get a good meal from Cafe Raymond instead. Just don't go so often that it starts getting lines like the diners do (-:"
"4.0","This food truck came to my office for lunch and I got the opportunity to try a new cuisine. When I got to the truck there was a bit of a line (about 5 or 6 people in front of me), but the guys inside kept the line moving and kept the food coming quickly.I ordered their spicy pork bowl and a side of dumplings. The spicy pork was layered with rice on the bottom, lettuce on top of that, a portion of breaded pork, and a ribbon of sauce on the top of everything. I didn't know they put dumplings on the bowl so I was excited to see they actually did.Cost of the bowl was $10. The rice was the largest portion in the bowl (probably about 1.5 cups) and the pork portion was smaller (maybe 1/2 cup or so). But I found the bowl filling and was satisfied with the portion for lunch. I also had the side of dumplings, which definitely were worth the $4 charge.As for the taste, the spicy pork was spot on. Spice level was similar to a spicy tuna roll in sushi terms (so a bit of a kick, but not overly spicy). The flavor was just delicious. My only critique for the pork would be to get the slices of pork a bit more crispy. Some of them were a bit on the chewy side.The dumplings were, in a word, magnificent! The taste was delicious and they were perfectly crispy on the outside. They may have been one of the best dumplings I've ever had.For sure will get more from this food truck when I see them again."
"5.0","Today we had a meal that was so expertly crafted and served that was nothing short of exceptional! My sister had the Abby Alexander's angel hair .The dish had the juiciest chicken dressed in a white wine sauce with fresh spinach and tomatoes.We both KNOW that the homemade wedding soup is the best we have tasted in the city!!!! The beans and greens do not lack flavor.Sooooooo good.Lastly, the hot peppers and sausage will knock your socks off! They are so delicious eaten with their famous Italian bread.To end the evening we ordered the tiramisu and a canoliOH SO DELICIOUS. Looking forward to bringing more friends here for dinner.What a great treasure."
"2.0","First time here. Stopped in for lunch. Ordered two flatbreads to go. One red sauce one white sauce. Both pizzas were dry. Hardly no sauce to be found. Toppings were burnt. With all of the pizza competition out there i will take my business elsewhere"
"5.0","We ordered to go food about an hour ago.It was wonderful!  We loved it, especially the  Saag, aloo gobi masala and Korma.  We will definitely order from here again."
"5.0","Was there for lunch before the Phillies game on Sunday July 21. Food was great and the server George was outstanding I would definitely recommend this place"
"5.0","Great and fun lunch place. We went there this week and got some Porkasms and a Barbeque shrimp sandwich. Yumm - daring but good flavor combinations. Great people working there - friendly, funny and quick. Don't mind the free lollipops they throw in your to-go bag :) We'll be back!"
"5.0","Overall, we had a great night here once we figured it out.   It's different, for sure, but a nice concept and I'd definitely go back.   For starters, the service was excellent - our server was friendly, knowledgeable, and prompt.   She took the time to explain everything on the menu and overall did a great job.  About that menu though.   I recommend that you scroll through the photos on Yelp because you can't really picture the dishes with the menu descriptions otherwise.  The menu has great variety and is well suited toward a tapas style meal.  You can mix and match a bunch of different things for a fun and satisfying meal.  We sampled a bunch of dishes and shared bites...several of the Robotayaki (yummy little barbeque skewers), both types of gyoza (super crispy dumplings), the salmon handroll (absolutely delicious), Takoyaki (octopus balls - crispy outside and soft inside - yum!), the okonomiyaki (a friend pancake of goodies), and the miso ramen (good, but I liked all the other stuff better).   We finished with both desserts - highly recommend the fried ice cream.   Overall, the food was top notch - even if we weren't entirely sure what we were ordering.   The atmosphere of the place was nice as well, though be prepared for a few things.   First, it's hard to find, as many other yelpers have said.  The door is on the side street around from Round Corner.   You go in and are faced with two more doors - go straight.  Then up BOTH steep flights of stairs and there you have it.  Once you are up there, the space is pretty small.  We were seated in a room off the left - the Japanese style with a hole in the floor.  Ladies - this is a place for pants since getting up and down off the floor in a skirt can be a little less than graceful.       They did not appear to have a ton of seating, so I'd say that a reservation is the way to go."
"3.0","The food is delicious. The eggs are a little oily. The morning after breakfast special is what I always order when I go there with my family. I just have ONE problem: the table, menus, plates and cups NEED TO BE CLEANED. Its disgusting when you sit down at a dirty table and have to grab a dirty menu. Its a shame because the food is great and everything else is good."
"3.0","This restaurant has a lot of space with tables, seats, and booths if you want to hang out with some friends for a while. The cashier was very nice in her conversation. My order was prepared very fast. I enjoyed the taste of my broccoli cheddar soup and baguette. The bacon in my BLT roasted turkey avocado sandwich was soggy and not as good as I have eaten at other locations of Panera."
"4.0","Seafood was really nice, flavourful and fresh. Service was good, ambience is relaxing"
"4.0","Oh Luke Wholey's, what a great place for seafood. I have been for crab fest and I can say it is well worth it. We split the Alaskan King crab legs and the price was just right. They were also delectable, juicy and overall amazing. I would highly recommend them. My one issue though was when we were there, we ordered some sushi as well. It took a very long time and our server was apologetic about that. He kept updating us that it was coming and the sushi chef was backed up with orders. We were patient and finally got it but it was sub par. I don't think I would order it again, but it may be better on a night they aren't busy.During my second time at Luke Wholey's, I ordered the crusted ahi tuna and wow, what a delicious dish. The tuna was fantastic and tempura crusted asparagus was interesting, but tasty. I also loved the mashed potatoes, but who doesn't love mashed potatoes??? The blood mary's are to die for as well, you can add bacon and shrimp to them which is amazing. Highly recommend ordering one if you are into that cocktail!Overall, much love for Luke Wholey's and worth a visit."
"1.0","I got delivery for gluten free noodles. It was all oily and the noodles we're all broken. So gross. I mean not just oil used but literally drenched in a soupy oil. If you want oil soup noodles this is the place to go. Worst $20+ of my life spent on take out. Ew!"
"4.0","I drive by this place all the time and could not wait to try it. Over the summer the windows open up and people look like they are having a blast.  We finally got there last week and it is cute and cozy inside yet trendy.  They do not serve food but a great place to go for a cocktail. I did not think the prices were high and got a draft beer for $5. They had a nice selection of drafts including the pineapple beer from Rivertown-one of my favorites. My date went with a cocktail, an apple cider drink of some sort, slightly more expensive at $9 but worth the price. The music was good, it wasn't too crowded so we were able to get a table around 9:30 on a Friday night and they have board games that you can play at your table."
"4.0","First off, I wish I saw the 30% off deal (per the Yelp page) for calling in the order! I'm a little bummed about that since I ordered via eat24 (owned by Yelp). Oh well!I am not from the area, so I looked around on Yelp and Eat24 before settling on Beta Bites for dinner while staying near the Convention Center. I ordered the chicken sandwich, side of okra, and a Gatorade. I didn't know that the sandwich came with fries, so it ended up being a lot more food than I expected! Everything was great- my only complaint would be the bread to chicken/veggies ratio (lots of bread, not much in the sandwich). The fries and okra were delicious, as were the sauces on the side. I just couldn't finish everything.Food came on time, delivery man was friendly, and everything was under $20! I would definitely order from them again if I'm back in the city!"
"5.0","Another place I would recommend is The Summit. It's places nicely on Shiloh street. It's a good dinner and drinks joint.We came here for drinks one evening and stayed for some food. We ordered fried  Brussels Sprouts and fries with our drinks. Everything came out fast and hot. The provide water for the table to have. We went during happy hour so we had the drinks and apps deal that was available to us. The place is kinda small and does not sit any many people. It is first come first serve and you can sit wherever you find a spot. It's always crowded when we come, so don't be in a hurry if you stop in.Overall, the food and drinks were great but the seating is a little tight . You gotta be comfortable with being close to people ."
"3.0","It was our first order from Beta Bite. I ordered a chicken pannini and my husband ordered a 10' pepperoni pizza. The delivery was somehow fast and the quality was average. based on the reviews, I expected fries with my sandwich, but no fries! Also, my husband's pizza was small and oily. Surprisingly, there was also a chicken bone in my sandwich! In overall, average quality and expensive with respect to the small portions."
"5.0","Run!  do not walk to this food truck! Had their combo tonight ... sliced beef/kimchi/rice bowl tonight @hitchhiker brewing. It was incredibly flavorful... also had these dumplings that were so delicious!"
"5.0","The chicken tagines are so yummy! My kids love the pizzas. We really love the different options that we can't get anywhere else. We always call in ahead and pick it up."
"5.0","This is probably one of the very few good bakeries in Pittsburgh. I got the chocolate croissant which was the right amount of flaky, crunchy, and softness. I also really liked the dark chocolate and buttery flavor that was not overwhelmingly greasy like some other croissants can be. I also got the apple tarte which was good, but just average. When I was here the almond croissant looked a bit flat for a croissant which is why I decided not to get it. But after reading some of the other reviews on here, I'll be trying it out next time!"
"4.0","I FINALLY made it down to Umami, and after eating there... DO NOT WAIT. It's super delicious and absolutely worth the price. We went with some friends and ordered a ton of food while sitting at the bar. Pros: The pork AND vegetable Gyoza was bomb-diggity bomb. The edamame was prepared perfectly and just the right amount of salt as well. My cocktail (7-night stay - Wray & Nephew Jamaican white rum, Kai lychee vodka, coconut lemongrass nigori, lychee calpico, lime) was absolutely gorgeous, edible flower anyone?, and tasted divine. We got the spicy scallop hand roll, spicy tuna hand roll, and some octopus. Friends ordered the fried/crispy chicken which I tasted and LOVED. The service was awesome, the girl at the bar slinging our drinks was pleasant and sweet. She was helpful and seemed to genuinely enjoy what she was doing. Cons:Seating is slim! So keep that in mind, it's not a great place for a large group of people but definitely great for a date. The Miso soup is sweet, I mean candy sweet. I didn't think it was bad but our friends did not love it. It vaguely tasted like pineapple(?) if that makes sense. It was definitely heavier on the sweet than savory side. The waitress took it off my friends bill, and said she hadn't tasted it today but that it normally skews a little sweet. So take that as you will. I'd definitely go back here and actually look forward to it!"
"1.0","This place used to be one of my favorites, but it has gone straight downhill.First, they reduced the price from $9-10 per person to $6 per person, but they severely diluted the food and took away the free soft drinks. Most watery Indian food ever now. The tikka masala actually resembled soup -- I don't think there was any cream in it any more. Secondly, THEY KICKED ME OUT OF MY SEAT AT NINE MONTHS PREGNANT. Very rude server told me I had to leave after sitting there for 15 minutes -- at nine months pregnant. I told him he was rude, he shrugged, he didn't care.This restaurant is an atrocity at this point. I used to get lunch and takeout here regularly but I will NEVER go back now. I can get better Indian food out of a box and better service off of a food truck at this point. Unbelievable."
"5.0","Located at the far end of the strip district. They have a small parking lot next to the market. If you're going for lunch I would suggest going before noon or else there is a huge line. The portions are big enough for 2-3 meals and the staff is super friendly. But most importantly, the food tastes good! I ordered rice, chicken tikka masala, saag paneer, naan, a veggie samosa and a bottle of water and it came out to $14. The samosa was the best that I ever had and I went home with enough left overs to last me at least a second meal."
"5.0","Outstanding food! Great environment and exceptional service! Our server, George, was accommodating, friendly and gave us great tips for visiting the city for the first time from Southern California! Spent more than enough time to make is feel welcomed and can helped us get a selfie with Jerome Bettis himself! Would come back here again just for the service provided by George!"
"1.0","Worst experience I've ever had. The host was incredibly rude. We asked what the wait time was for a party of 4. They took one look at us and first said 'It's a long wait,'and then the other host said 'like, an hour.' They were so mean to us based on what we looked like. I am so disappointed in this experience based on the fact the Redbeard's on The Incline was so nice."
"3.0","We went there in a group for Sunday lunch! I wish I went for a full menu, I really don't like buffet that much, most of the food were too spicy for a non Indian.It was 8$ for lunch, which was reasonable."
"5.0","Asked for the cashier's suggestion, she recommended the ciabatta lox and it was perfect!"
"4.0","I've been wanting to return for the awesome Caffe Mona brunch for a while - in fact I can't believe it's been so long since we've been here. After reading some less than stellar reviews I felt compelled to jump in and send Caffe Mona some love!This place is incredibly cute - very European inspired, brick walls, wooden tables & an awesome back patio. Reminds me very much of Birchwood Kitchen in Chicago, which I love! Plus they have a killer location literally right across the street from Children's Hospital. The $13.99 prix fixe brunch menu was an exciting thing to find. The only thing that could have made it better would have been knowing it was BYOB before we went. Nothing better with a tasty brunch than a good bottle of champagne, although their coffee was pretty darned delicious.I started off brunch with a fresh fruit plate and everything served was in season, ripe & juicy. Great start. Then I was served a dish that made my eyes roll back in my head (even without the champs)! The savory French toast topped with house made fig jam, Brie that was super creamy & buttery and Granny Smith Apples was absolutely superb. The flavor combinations complemented each other perfectly and I only shared a couple of bites with hubby & devoured the rest. I was totally stuffed when the final item, an apricot jam crepe, was placed in front of me. Sad to say, they should have skipped this item. It was crunchy & pretty flavorless. I couldn't have eaten it anyway, but based on the rest of the meal it just didn't compare. Next visit, I'll have a hard time not ordering that French Toast again & you can bet there will be champagne!"
"5.0","The buffet was straightforward and delicious. It was about $25 for two people for lunch. We stopped about 45 mins before they closed but food was still stocked and fresh. Restaraunt was quiet and clean. Bathrooms located in basement. My favorite dishes were the chicken tikka masala, saag, veggie korma and naan. Desserts were satisfying as well. Mango pudding with fruit chunks and warm gulab jamun so yummy. I will definitely keep this spot as one of my oakland favorites"
"5.0","Fabulous dinner here for restaurant week! Had the field green salad- tasty dressing ... filet (highly recommend adding shallot butter!), and cheesecake!!! Soooo good. Great service."
"4.0","Solid taco spot have never really had a bad taco. I used to work right next door but not down that way much these days"
"4.0","I know I am so late to the party reviewing Pamela's. I've lived here for years and been a few times but I'm usually pretty resistant when someone suggests Pamela's because I don't feel like waiting in a huge crowd for breakfast food that is good, but not justified by the wait. I have changed my tune...mostly. Two family members in town for a total of four of us around noon on Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend. The wait was about 25 minutes but not much of a problem with all the shopping nearby. I would say the wait they quoted us was pretty much spot on. The chorizo hash is the selection here for sure. My sister and I shared an order of that and an order of the plain pancakes. Just the right amount of savory, spicy and salty and definitely way more than enough food for us to share. One thing I don't really like is their eggs.....way to buttery tasting. Even without finishing the eggs there was plenty to eat and the taste of the eggs is more a matter of personal preference. Cash only...but they make that really clear from the minute you walk in so no one should be caught unprepared."
"3.0","Decent food for a good price, however I waited 20 minutes for an omelette with potatoes to go. It was Saturday AM and it was a little crowded, so I'll give them that, but a large group of to-go orders who ordered after me received their food before me, at which point I started inquiring about the status of my order. They had just started making my omelette... if I wanted to wait that long, I should have just stayed in the line at DeLuca's right next door"
"5.0","This is a great little lunch time gem downtown. My coworkers and I went looking for a bargain lunch downtown. For $10, you got to choose 2 food items and a beverage. I went with 1 arepa and 1 empanada. I still can't tell which one I liked more, both were great. If you're unfamiliar with the food the very friendly gentleman at the register passionately explains what an arepa is and what is best to suit your tastes. The staff is very very friendly, and the little sauces they make to go with the food are fantastic.Be aware that this place does not have sit down tables and chairs, but more tall tables and a counter that you lean and eat at. They of course do to-go orders as well. This is worth a try if you're an adventurous eater!"
"4.0","Pretty standard bar food. Clean atmosphere. Great spot for after work happy hour. The bartenders are really friendly. It's my friends meeting spot for our after work hangouts."
"5.0","Delicious corned beef sandwiches and friendly staff. I loved this place so much I visited twice on my 4 day stay."
"4.0","Great food and drinks - especially the selection on tap.  Big portions and good prices - especially for a casino joint.  Friendly staff - very attentive.  We ate at the bar.  Had the Cobb salad and ultimate nachos between two people.  Stuffed!!  Still had lots of cash to lose at the casino."
"5.0","one of the best places for breakfast ever. It gets packed every weekend with students, parents, and locals alike. don't be afraid to put your name in and wait the little bit to get an amazing breakfast. the interior is pretty festive with old school board games all over the walls and ceiling. Has some of the standards of breakfast such as pancakes (hotcakes), eggs, omelets, etc  but also has their spin on it. this is a cash only restaurant so make sure that you have plenty of cash in order to pay for this meal. I really liked the western style omelet that i got which had chorizo sausage in it. so good"
"1.0","I wouldn't recommend this place to an enemy, very unprofessional , especially for it to be a small family owned business"
"5.0","This was my 2nd time here this weekend and my 5th time overall. From the service to the food to the beer, this brewery/restaurant is a great addition to Pittsburgh. The other 30 + breweries in Allegheny County (with the exception of a few) either don't have food or have rotating food trucks. Today my husband and I celebrated Valentine's Day early and went for Sunday brunch. The veggie omelette with rapini and chive/cheddar cheese (honestly don't remember exactly what it was) was flavorful and a generous portion.  The breakfast potatoes popped with spices (not spicey though) and peppers. My only regret is that there wasn't more of them!My hubby and I are beer geeks and I'm a member of the group Pittsburgh Beer Ladies, but today I opted for the Bloody Mary.....it did not disappoint. Sarah's a great mixologist! Spicy and had pickled vegetables...again I would have eaten a plate of them! It even came with a 'sidecar' of their Cobra Toes Kolsch. Our server Brie described the toaster pastries so well that I couldn't resist them.  Handmade pastry with apple pear jam and foie gras?!?!? Topped with jam made with their Berliner Weisse that appeared as little golden bubbles! The icing also had foie gras and also had toasted fennel seed! Friday night I had the pastrami sandwich with pickled peppers.........total yumminess! My favorite beer tonight was Sand County the Coffee Wit......combining coffee and  a wheat beer is not something I would typically drink but putting the two together was delicious! I also had the Room Tone NE IPA which combined fruity and hoppy and for me that's just the kind of IPA I've been drinking and enjoying lately. The space is warm and inviting. I wouldn't change a thing! Can't wait to see what's next in their beer lineup!"
"4.0","We go to Pittsburgh maybe twice a year and we always try to go Pamela's every trip.  This place fills up very quickly and I remember often having to line up to get in.One of the first things you will notice is that there is a photo of Obama at the cash register right out front.  Some things to point out before I get to the food is that the washrooms are upstairs through the South American restaurant that shares the same building.  Another thing is that the tables do not move so there is no re-arranging for larger parties.  This place only accepts cash unless they've changed that from the last time I was there it's always been like this at least for this location.The tables are small considering the amount of plates you will get when you order breakfast.  Really with the coffee and side plates of toast, hash, etc it will be a balancing act to get everything on one plate maybe...  So if you ordered side of sausage or whatever, if you can throw it on your main plate and stack all the side plates if possible.Now to the food.  It's damn good period.  I mean breakfast is tough because you can really only twist it so many ways so what makes Pam's special?  The crepes and pancakes is what is unique if I had to pick something.  The crepes you can get will walnut and creme and whatever but they ultimately become humongous and if you had something else like bacon and eggs then you will have no room on your table and in your stomach (maybe) because the portions can be big.I prefer plain pan cakes with butter and syrup and nothing else added myself... their pancakes... the edges are crispy and light but not too fluffy.  We usually get a side of corned beef hash which is just awesome but wow I try not to think about how much sodium is in it especially since I always get bacon too.The place has packed for a reason and they're not all tourists because Shadyside is a nice cozy neighborhood.  When locals pack a place consistently the reason is simple... the place is +++"
"1.0","came here for a lunch buffet, and i am a huge fan of indian food. Friend took me to one in squirrel hill and it was delicious but this was not the case here at tamarind.  I live right down the street at the king edward and was hoping this place would be a gem. Okay.. i tried i really really TRIED to like this place but when your chicken tikka masala is the ONLY dish i'd consider borderline acceptable during a lunch buffet, that's a problem. c'mon its chicken tikka masala. make the chicken tender and the sauce takes care of itself. this felt like chewing rubber with a side of gravel. the one star is there for the excellent service. who was also nice enough to leave his name, Martin (standup fellow) and number (i wouldn't be so cruel) on a napkin for our friend because she was cute as hell"
"1.0","$7 for an IPA on tap. $6.50 for a cider. $4 for flavorless tortilla chips, salsa that wasn't much more than tomatoes and onion, and queso that was an unidentifiable mix of cheese and whatever else was lying around. $20 for bland 'nachos' and expensive drinks...we will never go back. Awful!"
"5.0","Heather the bar tender is fantastic. She was super nice and helpful. The food was great. The atmosphere was good and plenty of tv's to watch the game. Definitely a place to stop at when in town."
"3.0","Fab food, so-so service. In fact, there's favoritism shown in seating parties of the same size. Waited 50 mins while 3 parties, known to the hostess, were seated ahead of us. Only real downer of the experience, but we won't return."
"5.0","Alexander's is an extraordinary family-owned old fashioned Italian restaurant.Highlights: Homemade rice pudding, tiramisu. Sorry, desserts first.The bread is fresh and is served with oil, vinegar, and parmesan cheese.Traditional antipasto is delicious and made to suit the size of your party. For appetizers, the fried ravioli and calamari fritti are to die for. Entrees: the cream sauces, red sauces, and the pesto are all delicious but my favorite is the Marfredo Sauce, a mix of marinara and alfredo. The Marfredo goes really well with sliced spicy Italian sausage.PS. The service cannot be beat. It's one of the friendliest restaurants I have eaten in. I used to go there often when I was a student living in Bloomfield."
"5.0","Went here for an anniversary dinner. I recommend making reservations a week in advanced. We were seated almost immediately, which our table was decorated for our occasion. Our waiter Taylor, was very accommodating. To eat, I ordered the Bone In Kona crusted NY strip and my date got the Filet Mignon. We got the soy glazed Brussels sprouts with bacon to share. To drink, I ordered the blackberry bourbon sidecar and she got the grapefruit fire and ice (more fire than ice lol) Everything came out perfect, the best steaks we ever had! Definitely will be going back! Pro tip: use the Valet, it's only $7 (plus w.e you want to tip) and if you know how much a pain it is to find parking and how expensive garages are, it's completely worth it."
"5.0","Great little spot with great food. All exterior walls are garage doors and they were open today so it was great. Food - we just got some apps. Fries, chicken bean dip, and tacos. All were really good, quality dishes. We really enjoyed it. Drinks - the cocktails were awesome. The bartenders do a great job and are definitely experienced at making some awesome drinks. The Penicillin is amazing. Bartenders - nice guys. Interacted with guests and made sure everyone was taken care of. We got extra chips without asking. Overall, awesome spot. Highly recommend."
"5.0","Great little place! First time here, but went with friends who have been before. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Each of the bagel meals comes with a side salad which has a delicious balsamic vinaigrette dressing. All the food was wonderful! Would recommend this place to anyone."
"2.0","Not missing anything here!  The pizza has zero taste and was rather disappointing!  The dough tasted like cardboard with a very bland sauce.   Might be a good place for drunk college students but certainly not for a quick lunch while enjoying events down on the south side.  Over rated, over priced for poor quality."
"4.0","This past Friday, 05/05, went to Burgh'ers for an early dinner.  My first impression of the site was bright, contemporary, well thought out!  Hostess and waitstaff were great...friendly, smiling and through chatting were happy to be working there.  Since the tavern license hadn't started yet, we were treated to free Straub draughts.  The menu was, in my opinion, their starting off point.  Besides wild game, beef and chicken, I would like to see maybe a salmon burgher or an open face entree.I opted to build my own burger with potato bun, cheddar, carmelized onions and sauteed mushrooms.  The bun  was great.  I am so sick of those 'brioche' buns falling apart under the weight of great stuffins.  My burger was prepared to order and came out perfectly.  Now...the fries.  I have lived long enough to have gone through many many incantations of the french fry.  Curly, spicey, puffy bubbled crispy version, etc.  What I got at Burgh'ers was honest to goodness fries which actually tasted like potatoes, crispy, hot and plentiful.  Anyone who knows me always can depend on eating fries from my plate when I am done with my meal.  In this case...fork and knife were up in defense of my fries.  The first time in almost 20 years that I cleaned my plate.The restaurant is new, attractive, friendly staff, great food.  You will be doing yourself a favor to try Burgh'ers."
"5.0","1st time in new layout.  great place!  they're still working out a few glitches.  very friendly staff.  quick and efficient.  Superburger forever!  (50 years ago as a teenager i ate 2 at a seating at the rt51 carrick location)  in case you don't know history this is their answer after they dropped the big boy franchise.  If it was not for the Big Boy and superburger there would not be a big Mac (invented in western PA in response to the BB and SB which does extremely well here when 15 cent mckyd's weren't hitting it .  sister had buffalo chicken BIG salad with garlic toast.  she liked it (so did I).  wish i could have had one of their sundae's but.  best place of this type in the burgh!"
"4.0","Saw this place pop up while browsing Yelp one day for new eats and decided to swing on by. The joint offers five different premade taco options with fixings made to order: carnitas (pork), pollo (chicken), molida (ground beef), Americano, and vegan, along with a side of beans or nachos as additional paid extras for those wanting a little more to their taco fix. Tacos are $3 each and from what I remember of the sides, I think the beans were $2 and the nachos were $5.I came and ordered four tacos, one carnitas, one pollo, one molida, and one Americano. Also got them with three corn shells and one flour shell. I will say that I definitely liked the corn shells better ... not as starchy as the flour shell and it has a bit more flavor to it. As for which taco was my favorite? Probably the pork one. The pulled pork in it was tender, juicy, and delicious. The slaw and farmer's cheese in it made each bite all the more tasty. I personally found the chicken to be a bit dry ... might do better for them not to overcook it. The beef one was alright ... it might have tasted better with a bit more cheese in it to offset the acidity that comes from the beef and its juices. Overall I found this place to be a great place to get Mexican tacos ... not sure I'd put them above Las Palmas, but definitely a decent option for those around in South Side!"
"1.0","The waitress served us today is really rude and mean. The whole dining experience is disgusting"
"3.0","A nice option for a bite to eat at the park, the cafe serves a nice range of salads, sandwiches, soups and pizzas and has a welcome number of vegetarian options. The prices are quite reasonable for a museum/tourist site cafe and the eating area is clean and welcoming. They also use biodegradable cups and forks, and compost their waste, which is nice to see. They also focus on organic, local food. Though my salad wasn't anything super special, it was tasty enough and I'd happily go back to support Phipps and its cafe."
"3.0","Came here for the lunch buffet during the week. There are a good amount of people that come from UPMC and Pitt, which means there is a frequent turnover of food! The buffet has all the classics of rice, naan, tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala, saag, potatoes, and chickpeas. I was a fan of the chicken korai as the chicken was very tender and had good flavor. The saag was good, but wish it had paneer. The mushrooms were unique as well. The buffet also includes a variety of dessert such as rice pudding and gulab jumans. Overall, a decent place to grab some Indian food in the oakland area if you are near there. Can't complain for the price, but don't expect outstanding Indian food. Truly dont know if I will be back, as my loyalty lies to Tamarind on North Craig."
"4.0","First time here. Will definitely be on the list of repeat restaurants. It's a very cool space; huge garage door-type windows that were open to Penn Ave!  If only so many yinzers didn't smoke it would've been even more enjoyable(but that's not the restaurant's fault). Amazing beer list!  Hard to make a decision because there were so many good options!  Also many great wines to choose. We started with a small cheese plate and a small bread basket. Both were phenomenal although I was not a fan of the raisin chutney on the cheese plate. We split the peppers and Parmesan pizza. It was perfect!!  And I don't say that lightly. But be warned, those are fresh peppers and they pack a punch!Staff was attentive, personable, and helpful...which is always refreshing!"
"4.0","Sausalido is located in hip neighborhood of Bloomfield.  On this Wednesday night (one day before Thanksgiving) the Italian district was bustling with hungry patrons, and people celebrating the end of the work week. Sausalido isn't large; it probably seats 50, and the décor is minimal.  When we arrived at 7pm, there were a few other diners, and plenty of seating.  Our waiter arrived promptly, and offered to open our bottle of Cabernet (Sausalido is BYOB).   As he pulled the cork from our bottle, we asked for a plate of mussels and a Caesar salad with extra anchovies while we decided on our main dishes.A small plate of bread and bean dip arrived with some crusty French bread.  Our Cabernet was a nice accompaniment to the garlicky appetizer- yum.Our mussels and Caesar salad arrived next.  My salad was served in a small bowl, and the romaine, croutons and fresh anchovies where piled high.  The lettuce was crisp and fresh; the Caesar dressing was tangy with just the right amount of garlic.The mussels were served in a large bowl with a rich tomato broth and julienne zucchini.  The mullusca were fresh and sweet, and salty.  The tomato sauce was fresh, and was extra good on the crispy bread.Entrée choices were: Salmon with ratatouille and pesto, double-cut pork with mashed potatoes, and crab cakes served with risotto.My salmon arrived piping hot.  I was surprised at the size of my portion; it was at least 8 oz. and cooked a perfect medium- delicious.  The basil pesto on top provided a beautiful color-contrast to the pinkness of the fish.  The ratatouille had large chunks of carrots, mushrooms, tomatoes, and zucchini- the veggies weren't over-cooked and added a nice texture contrast when eaten with the soft salmon.I had a chance to sample the crab cakes, and can say that the creamy risotto they were served with was some of the best I've ever had.  The huge pork chop (bone-in) looked awesome as well, and was quickly devoured by one of my dinner companions.'How is it?' I asked.'Delicious,' he answeredWe seriously considered not getting dessert, but were glad we did.  A large piece of pear and cinnamon cheesecake arrived at our table with four forks.  It was served with fresh berries in a pool of crème anglaise.  The cheesecake was dense, sweet, and rich- the pairs were deliciously fragrant. Sausalido can be described as contemporary European cuisine, but I'll describe it as the one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh that you haven't discovered yet.  The combination of perfectly executed food, exemplary service, and fun atmosphere will make this one restaurant you'll want to return to.Chef Chuck Kerber"
"3.0","I would like to give 5 stars because the location was great, the food was great and the concept was great but the service was not so great.  Talia and Jessica behind the bar were fantastic and so was the gentleman bartender (who may have also been a manager) but the rest of the girls behind the bar were just awful.  They couldn't get drink orders correct, they wouldn't come around to take your order and overall just couldn't be bothered.  We sat one evening for over 15 minutes just trying to get our check.  Also, the bathroom needed a good cleaning.  They do have a great menu and the things we did try were fantastic.  We gave them a few  attempts the weekend we were in town just because we liked the place so much.  It is a happening place.  Just needs a better staff."
"5.0","Their Buffets are life savers when you are a student and miss home food.They have made most of my Sunday's pleasant.They even have pongal, bread pudding and mango lassi! YAY!!!"
"4.0","Cozy atmosphere. For my friends who like beer they love the options. The gin mule is delicious. Prices are decent. Multiple vegetarian options for those non meat eaters. The staff is knowledgeable about the food in case you have allergies such as milk or egg or peanut. New menu items do pop up so there's  variety. I was able to alter items based on my allergies, no problem. Love the service, vibe, drinks, food. It's becoming a fast favourite to bring friends and family who visit and basically every weekend I have off. Definitely check it out!"
"4.0","The selection and hours are enough to earn a few stars in my book. But any place you can get a pierogi pizza and six pack of Four Loko on a Sunday gets my approval. The best pizza in Greenfield, and, for me, rivals Aiello's in Squirrel Hill. I had the pirogie pizza. It was as warm and inviting as the service and as hot and dense as a dying star. The potatoes were piled generously is what I'm getting at. They would easily be a five star place but it was just a bit on the pricey side and they could do with a couple more chairs. But those aren't things I'd be super concerned about."
"3.0","Their weekend buffets are amazing.Special chicken biriyani is the best - extremely spicy though. Chicken biriyani - not the bestDosa - can be better, but looks delish. Gobi manchurian - excellent! I keep going back because it's close by and fairly decent Indian food. Service is great, and menu selections are good."
"5.0","Had to try a little bit of everything and nothing disappointed. The almond croissant is one of the best I've ever had. I loved the softness in the middle and crunch on the ends. The salted caramel macaron was divine -- without question one of the best I've had, too. Will be back on my next trip to Pittsburgh!"
"5.0","Headed to 'The Burg' for a Pirates game and city tour. Stayed at the Renaissance Downtown and Redbeards is just down the block. Place is a two story clean well run city vibe bar. The beer is cold, solid tavern food and plenty of TV sports....Standing out food wise are the pierogies & the burgers. The 'cheese logs' are just that, logs, be prepared to share...But the true stand out was the staff, friendly, professional and fun....The owner did a fine job hiring his staff...Did hit the Shiloh St place much more a tavern feel.... The Jersey Boys will be back...!"
"5.0","The corned beef sandwich is the best. Add a cold brew and you don't need anything else."
"3.0","CHIRASHI (Sashimi rice bowl) and Tonkotsu Ramen were really great! Takoyaki was okay. I ordered the ROBATAYAKI as well. I like the bacon quail egg, but other than that were overpriced. Shrimp tastes not fresh and eggplant is undercooked. The place is a little bit crowded. Make a reservation in advance if possible."
"5.0","This is a review for the 'private events' floor of Cafe Raymond! My friend graduated from law school and hosted a graduation party on the second floor. This room appeared to be specifically designed for private events. The space was large enough to fit 50-75 people, yet cozy enough to create a warm, intimate feel. The highlight of the space was the attached balcony seating that overlooks the Strip District. It was the perfect place to admire the hustle and bustle of the busy streets below. The food was delicious - a wide variety of sandwiches, fruits, pasta salads, bacon covered shrimp etc.It was the perfect location for a celebration. I would highly recommend booking this location for future events"
"3.0","I came here about a year ago with some friends for dinner, when one of my friends wanted Italian food, and we wanted to try a place in Bloomfield.  I ordered the create-your-own pasta with mafalda pasta, gorgonzola basil cream sauce, and chicken.  The sauce was actually quite tasty, although a bit on the strong side, and overpowered the chicken quite a bit.  It was definitely unique, however!  The bread that was served with the pasta was thick and soft, but wasn't particularly unique.  Service was fine, and the atmosphere was nice.  Overall, not a bad option for Italian food in Bloomfield, and I'd go back if a dining companion wanted to try it, but I wouldn't go out of my way to return since there's better Italian to be had elsewhere in PGH.  3.5 stars."
"1.0","Really bad Italian food. Probably the worst I've ever had. The worst American version of Italian food."
"5.0","We went to their market a few days ago.  It was off the hook.  When we returned, we gave the restaurant a try.  The service was just as amazing as the market.  The food, fresh and well prepared.  You can't go wrong with either."
"5.0","Went here for lunch because I wanted to do something other than the regular primantis or burgatory. I got a hot turkey sandwich and the bread is incredible (from mancinis). I actually ended up going back the next weekend. For some reason the first time that I went there was an onion type thing going on in the air and my eyes were burning but the second time that didn't happen."
"1.0","So disappointing how bad the service was!We went to Bettis Grill 36 on 7/7/18 for a nice afternoon on the patio overlooking the river since the weather was fantastic.  The place was empty which was surprising but then we understood why...  We were sat on the patio as requested and it took 15 minutes (not exaggerating) for a waitress to acknowledge we were there.  It took another 10 minutes for our two beers to be brought to us.  It was unbelievable how slow she was.  While we had our drink and looked at the menus, one of the servers across the patio yelled at a group of customers who moved an umbrella to block the sun.  That was enough for us, we closed our tab and went across the street to Tequila Cowboy and had a great afternoon!  Sad to see Bettis' go so far downhill.  Best location in Pittsburgh but that alone won't get it."
"5.0","I don't know if this shows up on Yelp under 'breaksfast', but should. Found myself needing to eat before work, which is on Grant St.   A formal breakfast at the William Penn was a bit much (both cost and time) and nothing on that menu really spoke to me.  And I wanted something that is more in line with my 'diet.'So yes- Freshii does do breakfast!  I got the Green Eggs and Kale and it was just what my palette and my energy level needed. And it was more filling than I thought. Nice to take 10 min out of a morning to enjoy healthy, energizing food while sitting on a stool overlooking Grant St."
"5.0","One of the best bars in Pittsburgh! It's my favorite place to go in summer. The crowd is great and it's really good for office happy hours. It's one of the rare pubs in Pittsburgh that people dress up a little :)"
"5.0","Being a Steelers Fan of course we had to try this place. We tried once before after a game and that was an error. The wait was longer than the Wall of China. So on another trip we came on a random day. There wasn't much of a wait (I think I used No Wait App). The place was still a little crowded but nothing too bad. The food was good and I decided to try something different - I did the fried burger (I know sounds crazy, right). The entire burger is fried. It was surprisedly good. The drinks could be a little better. Our waiter was amazing and was able to handle being seated back to back like a pro."
"5.0","This is the hands down the best taco place in Pittsburgh. The tacos are made fresh on order and are extremely tasty. The service is good and there is usually no wait. The price is extremely reasonable with 3 dollars a taco. They have a variety of hot sauces to choose from also. The music is always good too."
"5.0","This place is amazing, one of my new favorite restaurants. The brisket sandwich is my favorite meal on the menu, it's so much better than the brisket at the bbq places in Pittsburgh. Cocktails are also good and the service is great."
"5.0","We went for restaurant week, and boy was I not disappointed. Not pictured: first course of lobster bisque. There were whole chunks of lobster and the taste was amazing. The bread they served is paired very well with it, too.Pictured: second course, which was pan seared salmon with corn polenta. I really like polenta and the side of it they served was delicious. The salmon was cooked perfectly, very tender, and tasted great! The third course dessert, which was a flourless chocolate cake. It wasn't a huge serving, which was perfect for lunch as it was just nice to have a little something sweet afterwards. It was very moist and dense. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive, too. The wait for our food was a little long, but that's completely expected during restaurant week. Overall a great experience."

"5.0","If you're looking for a unique dining experience in Pittsburgh, Umami is it! Situated up two flights of stairs and using primarily red lighting, it has a different atmosphere than any other restaurant I've been to in the city. If you want a table, definitely make a reservation, otherwise the bar seating is first come first served.We went at 11:45pm on a Friday night, and I was a little worried that the quality of the food wouldn't be as good so late at night. I couldn't be more wrong! Everything came out fresh and delicious. Since it was our first time, we ordered a wide variety of items, and I appreciated the pace and order that everything came out in. It's really hard to pick, but my favorites from our meal have to be the chirashi bowl (so fresh and such a great opportunity to try fish that I would never pick on their own!) and the spicy tuna onigiri (it was ACTUALLY spicy, unlike the spicy tuna at a lot of other restaurants). The prices for everything seemed really fair given the quality of the ingredients. We tried 9 different dishes between the two of us, and those plus a 24oz beer came out to about $80. Our waitress was super friendly and helpful which is always a good thing. If you're looking to have some really cool Japanese food in the city or impress a guest from out of town, Umami is definitely the place to go."
"5.0","I love this place! I was so exited to give it a try today for lunch. Great portion size for the price and the food is super fresh. It's a very nice addition to the downtown lunch scene and the staff is super friendly."
"1.0","I had a poor time, I recently went to get vegan tacos. The woman at the register told me there was not beans. That seemed odd to me for a taco place but I still said I wanted them, she then seemed reluctant,  talking me out of the tacos, but not really working with me to find another option. I just left, didn't try the food, the wait was pretty long, although there was no line, there was one employee doing everything. Preparing, taking orders, the girl seemed overwhelmed and therefore kind of rude.The ambiance was cool though."
"4.0","Good food, large portions. Spice level a little higher than what I am used to...glad I ordered a 4. It was more like a 6 in other places. But delicious! Pineapple Curry and Mussaman Curry were both really good. Nice prices, too! Will be back."
"5.0","Wow. We went to Pittsburgh for the weekend and this was our second stop. The service is amazing, attentive and super helpful if you're not from the area. The food is incredible. Being from Buffalo, we are partial to wings in the original place. These wings were Buffalo-approved and the drinks very satisfying. I would recommend to anyone they stop here, especially if it's summer. Loved the atmosphere, extremely welcoming and super friendly. All in all, an excellent experience and you are crazy not to stop here!"
"1.0","Alexander's offers some of the worst Italian food I've ever had. I went there with my girlfriend and my parents on a Saturday night, and from start to finish the experience that Alexander's gave us was simply awful. First, when we arrived around 6 pm, the restaurant was half-empty (bad sign #1). The hostess seated us at a table in the center of the very cramped and very small dining room (bad sign #2). Then, our waitress did not even come over to take drink orders for another 10 minutes (bad sign #3).Once the waitress finally arrived and took our orders, the food itself offered no relief. My girlfriend and I ordered the Caesar salad - the salads were drowning in Caesar dressing, the croutons were badly burnt and inedible, and there were too many croutons to begin with. This restaurant couldn't even get a simple salad right, but I hoped against hope that the entrees would be an improvement.Unfortunately, the entrees were no better. My girlfriend ordered Chicken Alfredo. Not only was the dish absurdly light on chicken (3 small pieces total? Come on!), the alfredo sauce was thick and gummy to the point of tasting like glue. My mom ordered the Mushroom ravioli, which was completely bland. I ordered the Veal Diablo with Shrimp; the plate came with 3 pieces of veal sliced extremely thin, 3 nice sized shrimp, and... that was it. No pasta, no garlic bread, nothing but an ocean of very mediocre marinara sauce. I finished my entire plate, the remaining half of my mom's plate after she was finished eating, and as much as I could stomach of my girlfriend's Alfredo (which was only a couple of forkfuls, as that Alfredo sauce was one of the foulest things I've ever eaten), but I still was left hungry.The dessert course offered a distinctly rotten cherry on top of this already heaping garbage sundae. We were initially assured that all of the desserts were made in-house, but that soon proved not to be the case. Indeed, for several of our desserts, a store-bought version would have been an improvement. I ordered a cannoli, figuring that even a crappy Italian restaurant can't screw up a cannoli, as it is a violation of Italian Law or something. Unfortunately, their 'fresh-made' cannolis consisted of a pre-packaged cannoli shell, pre-packaged cannoli filling (which, by the way, was gritty, as though someone had dumped in white sugar but not mixed the cream thoroughly enough for the sugar to dissolve), and put the two together in the kitchen. Needless to say, my cannoli was awful. My girlfriend ordered the tiramisu, and what she received was about as far removed from tiramisu as one can get. There were almost no ladyfingers, and the ones that were in the dish were drowning in coffee. On top of that, the dessert was swamped with an excessive amount of coffee-flavored cream that essentially destroyed the dish. My uncle's chocolate cake was dry and uninspiring; a store-bought cake would have been more moist.I did not pick up the check - my uncle was nice enough to do that - so I did not see the final bill. However, they could not have paid me to eat this often-inedible food. The service was slow and inattentive, the food was simply awful, and I left hungry. Do not waste your time, your money, or your energy with this place, as you can get better Italian food virtually anywhere else in the city."
"4.0","3.5 starsCHiKN is affordable, filling, and tasty--a good quick-eat addition to Oakland. The food is pretty salty which is why I think the chicken tastes better on the sandwich than by itself. The fries have good seasoning, but are nothing special. As someone who likes spicy food, I thought that the Medium spice level had a kick, but was not overly hot. The service was quick and their table/buzzer system seems pretty efficient."
"4.0","Oh man, I really like this place a lot.  So far I have only tried their prepared foods/cafeteria section, but I can tell you that if you (1) like middle eastern / indian food, (2) want to eat a LOT of it, and (3) don't want to pay very much for it, this is the place you are looking for.Service is very fast.  The food is surprisingly delicious for how little it costs.  The average meal here will cost you between $7-10, and it's a guarantee that you will not leave here hungry.  The portions are GENEROUS.  And the food is TASTY.  I love the chicken shawarma sandwich, the falafel sandwich, and many of the items in the hot food 'meals' section (which you can mix and match and pay for a single meal).  Their sides are also nice -- delicious hummus and baba ghanouj, among others.Realistically I think Salem's is a 4.5-star place!  And the half-star docked only because I view it as a strictly to-go joint.  The sit-down atmosphere is set up to be quick and efficient...it literally looks like a barren cafeteria.  I would probably not have a sit-down meal there with friends (although, if you don't mind the atmosphere, it is VERY easy to find tables and nobody will bother you or get mad if you're being loud).  But -- for a bomb diggity carryout place where you can order there and get your food fast, Salem's is fantastic.I can't wait to try meat from the market, too!"
"5.0","Had a fantastic girls lunch and George was a fantastic server. He made great suggestions and the bear I had was unbelievable. It was called hala kahiki pineapple beer. It was really great. Food wise we had pirogies grilled wings and firecracker shrimp. Great location and George was so attentive and knowledgeable about the area, drinks and food"
"1.0","There are SO many good reviews of this place on both Grubhub and Yelp--so I decided to use my weekly calorie-splurge night on their specialty Steak Pie and Chicken Salad. The salad was what I expected, really nothing great at all--a little bit of iceberg lettuce, onion, 2 grape tomatoes, chicken and a few steak fries, essentially what you would expect ordering a salad from a pizza place. (Think of this one Family Guy episode, haha.) But the pizza was equally unappetizing. Not only was is luke-warm upon arrival, but the toppings weren't properly cooked. It was a bunch of raw green peppers, mushrooms and some other barely-cooked veggies with very little steak on top of thin, under-cooked dough. I am genuinely disappointed right now. It looked really good when I opened it, but I knew after the first bite it was a bust. Perhaps this was just a bad day for them, but they won't be getting any business from me ever again--there are too many other great pizza places in Pittsburgh to waste my money on one that can produce such an underwhelming (and frankly, off-putting) product."
"1.0","Didn't realize that choosing 'spicy' meant setting your tastebuds and insides on fire. Seems like instead of adding salt and spice they added spice twice. It was essentially like eating chillies disguised as curries. You could literally see the red chilly oil or power covering the whole box. The rice was undercooked and the samosa chat was essentially pickled onions with an undercooked samosa in the middle."
"5.0","Good food! The owners who are also the servers are friendly and welcoming. I had the feta,mozerrala, and spinach crepe it was really good. If you are around Pittsburgh this place is a must! I visit Pittsburgh regularly and this place is always on the top of the list! The French toast is my favorite, I crave their French toast all the time! If you are a coffee taster, their coffee is one of the best in town if not in America!"
"5.0","If you like seafood and you like pizza you will LOVE this seafood pizza. Soooo delish"
"4.0","I've never had a beer here so I can't comment on that, but I've been here three weekends in a row for breakfast and it's gooooood. Prices are reasonable and food is awesome. Just be ready to hit the gym right after, cause it definitely ain't healthy!"
"5.0","Family-owned and operated, the ambiance is much better than down the street at Thai Cuisine. But the dishes are still quite good for a family restaurant and they can also make things REALLY spicy."
"3.0","Ordered delivery from this location today- large pepperoni pizza. The pizza arrived in a timely manner (about 45 minutes). The crust was nice and chewy, but lacked flavor. They were generous with the cheese. Overall, the pizza I received was average (not bad, but not great). As someone who is new to the area, I will likely try other pizza places in the future."
"5.0","I love love love this place. I'm from a city in Massachusetts that is heavily Portuguese so having some authentic Azorean food close by here in my new city of Pittsburgh is absolutely amazing and so comforting. The food is awesome. If you're new to Portuguese food, TRY IT!  Highly recommend and kinda can't wait to become a regular here."
"5.0","I heard really good things about the smiley face cookies so I had to go here. The cookies were really good and I mailed some to my husband in Korea and he said they were still soft when he got them. The burger I had I was really good and I ate mine with a gluten free bun. The gluten free bun was absolutely the best I've ever had and tasted like normal bread. The service was a bit slow but the food made up for the time I waited."
"5.0","Always have to come to Pamela's when I come back to Pittsburgh. Always crowded for breakfast on the weekends but so worth it. And the prices are right for the amount of food you get!"
"5.0","Celebrating a special occasion. This is a place I would recommend. Valet makes it a breeze to get to considering it's in the heart of Downtown. The ambiance is very classy, romantic and they really pay attention to detail. To celebrate a birthday they put birthday themed confetti on the table. The drink menu and wine list was on an iPad. It was easy to navigate even if you are not tech savvy. I had the Stoli Doli a pineapple martini and it was good. The bread was delicious. I loved the lobster bisque it had a nice big chunk of lobster in it. I had the pan seared scallops with lobster mac which were phenomenal. The service was outstanding. They really impressed me. It was a fine dining experience and I would certainly go back. There are several menu items I want to try."
"5.0","Favorite brunch place that I've dined at since I moved to lawrenceville, kind of slow service though. Breakfast sandwich was larger than average, which was a nice surprise. Free coffee or tea when you check in too!"
"5.0","The fish was so fresh and awesome. I would skip the takoyaki/octopus balls here, personally. My husband enjoyed the ramen. I would say it's not kid friendly as the place only has bar and high top seating. I would also suggest a reservation. We came at 5:30 on a Friday and were lucky to get bar seating. The steps are steep and not friendly for anyone who uses mobility aids."
"3.0","They start you off with 2 very different sauces: a spicy (green habanero?) sauce, and a sweet purple (berry?) sauce... and they are the two halves of my heart. Also if you want spicy... just ask, and they'll kick it up to 11. Get take out if you don't want to sit in a relatively empty joint. Other than that, if you want indian food, this is a great place.8 for taste, 5 for atmosphere."
"5.0","What a surprise to get a recommendation for a Mt Washington happy hour that wasn't just about a view. Getting there by 5:30 gave us a chance to get a seat and enjoy the food beer and cocktails. The cocktails really stand out for me as adventurous, delicious and reasonably priced. They featured some ingredients that were new to me (and I've had a few cocktails in my time). Fortunately the waitress was probably one of the best servers I've had in a long time. She was engaging and really knew her stuff regarding content and profile of drinks and food. She had clear explanations of prep and end product. In addition to that she had a personality. She was terrific. The happy hour plates were enough to share and were brought to the table quickly and without errors. Mussels,fries, and a Brussels/cauliflower mix were enough to fill up some big eaters."
"2.0","I was not impressed with the food.  My girlfriend said the quiche was great (5/5) and the potatoes were horrible (0/5).  I ordered two scrambled eggs (5/5), sausage (2/5), wheat toast and their potatoes (0/5).  First I must say kudos to the sous-chef since I believe she made the eggs.  They were cooked *perfectly* without any scorching.  The sausage was in a flattened patty that was overcooked and hard to cut with a fork.  It was pretty nasty and I will not order it again.  The potatoes were even worse; flavorless and dried out.  I believe they make them by the pan and keep them in an oven, sometimes mixing the old pan with the new.  I say this because some were cooked correctly and others were shriveled, black and all moisture was burnt out of them.  Chef Raymond or Management needs to investigate the potato situation because they were a 0/5 in my rating system as well.Our total bill with drinks was around $25.  $25 for two breakfasts should be astounding food in my opinion.  It was not."
"5.0","Came here during lunchtime after stopping by the post office across the street. I ordered a lamb kabob sub and was pleasantly surprised by how good it turned out to be. Idk about the other reviews but the lamb was definitely good quality meat and their service was fast and reliable (~10 min to make the sandwich)."
"4.0","This place is so tiny you might never notice it tucked into a tiny storefront on Liberty. But sometimes those hidden spots are hidden gems, and this is seriously one of those places.I worried when I tried to call in our order and got a message that the mailbox was not in service. After double and triple checking the number, I actually thought the place must have gone out of business, except there were reviews from just a week or two ago. I decided to walk over and check it out, and am glad I did. The place was pretty busy for a random Sunday evening, but the take out was made quickly, and was some of the best Thai food I've had in Pittsburgh. The peanut sauce with the summer rolls was everything I wanted it to be, my partner's prik noodles were awesome, and my red curry was fiery and delicious. This place will take your heat requests seriously - order a ten at your own (and your intestines') risk. We'll definitely return."
"4.0","While I do think Pamela's is a tad bit overrated on Yelp, I still think it deserves 4 stars just for their crepe-like pancakes. Pamela's is the perfect breakfast/brunch spot for anyone with a sweet tooth. I ordered their Strawberry pancakes and it was an explosion of sugary goodness in my mouth. Each order comes with 2 thin hotcakes rolled up in cylindrical fashion, filled with fresh strawberries, brown sugar, syrup and topped with whipped cream. If I didn't have diabetes before, I just may have it now. The hotcakes were melt-in-your-mouth soft while retaining some crispiness and char along the edges. I also ordered scrambled eggs and ham which were both pretty average. My buddy ordered the Tex-Mex omelet and was less than impressed. Sure, the food might be a little greasy and/or buttery but I did not go to Pamela's expecting to eat granola and bananas. Overall, the food, service and ambiance were all pretty average. The Strawberry pancakes was the only exceptional dish that raised my overall rating of Pamela's to a 4."

"4.0","This establishment is three restaurants in one, so make sure you look at the menus and decide which one you want to eat at before you go. My reservation was made for Mezzo but what I wanted was on the Emporio menu. I ended up eating at Mezzo, and it was actually really delicious. Not great for vegetarians, though, so I was limited in my options. The mushroom risotto turned out to be fantastic! Also, I was impressed by the 'small bread'. For $4 I thought it was going to be some small piece of bread, but it turned out to be a decently sized bread basket with 3 different kinds of bread, and two accompaniments (though one had meat in it). My server was attentive and made sure I didn't eat it though. Great value for the price and tasted amazing."
"3.0","As I've mentioned in previous reviews, I'm not a huge fan of Chinese food. However, I can still always find something on the menu that I can enjoy. If it wasn't for my BFF's admiration for this place, I probably would have never gone. The atmosphere is very cliche downtown Chinese restaurant, but it works. I definitely felt like I was legit in Chinatown.I ordered the chicken cashew dinner. Always a safe bet for me. The meal was good, except it was 1/2 chicken and nuts and 1/2 mushrooms. I'm not a huge mushroom person so I was taken back by how many were in my dish when it showed up in front of me. Service is okay and very average. A big perk about the restaurant is additional parking. It's probably the only place downtown that has a (free) parking lot for guests. You may have to drive around the block a few times, but I was able to get lucky."
"5.0","** Solid brunch place in the strip district with a wide selection of breakfast foods (all day) as well as sandwiches. Blueberry ricotta pancakes are for sure a highlight to check out.This place has been super hyped up to me after hearing my girlfriend and her friends rave about how good the ricotta pancakes were, how they were 'so soft that they melt in your mouth,' and how this place is the 'best breakfast place in Pittsburgh.' Eventually I had to check it out to see if they were just blowing up smoke or this place was legit. After coming here with her to try out their ricotta pancakes, I have to say they were't exaggerating. I ordered the guy's breakfast, which came with a good variety of bacon, eggs, potatoes and the blueberry ricotta pancakes. I love having a variety of different foods to eat in one breakfast plate, with a combination of sweet and savory so to me this place got off to a good start. Everything about the savory foods was just as you'd expect to be, nicely seasoned, warm and tasty. The pancakes were definitely what set Cafe Raymond apart... and no lie my teeth sunk right through the warm pancake immediately upon contact. There were real berries found in the pancake as well, and the pancake tasted fresh, unlike other places where they taste like they have been sitting out for awhile. What I also liked was the fact that the pancake wasn't overly sweet, allowing you to adjust the sweetness to your liking with however much syrup you desire. This is a place I'd definitely come back to if I have the chance!"
"5.0","What a great asset for Lawrenceville!!! This place has a ton of local food, which includes produce, meats and a good mix of other products. If there is something you can't find, the girls will look into it and put it on the shelf. They're very friendly and it's like I'm going to see a good friend every time I go to the store."
"3.0","My wife and I went here for dinner on a Friday evening. We had reservations for six since we weren't sure how busy it was going to be. We got there and there were several tables available for walk in which surprised me a bit. Not sure how busy it is typically on a weekend evening, but the reservations were nice to ensure us a table. We both started with a hazy New England style IPA. I would give it a 3.5 out of 5. There were lots of other beers. Most of them seemed more atypical than what your average brew house would have given burgers being the main staple of the menu. We also ordered the pickle brined chicken. It was given good reviews on yelp so we gave it a try. It appeared they went with a corn flakes breading. The breading to meat ratio was way out of proportion and the breading didn't adhere to the meat very well. Perhaps it was just a poor dredging process. The pickle was very subtle but you could definitely tell it was brined as it was overly salty. I would give it a 2.5 out of 5. My wife ordered the shady side and I ordered the Maggie's Farm with fries. Both were very good we thought. Again though it seemed like the patties were overly salted. The freshness and flavor of the other ingredients helped though. We would give the burgers and sides a 4 out of 5. Lastly, the service was decent. 4 out of 5. I only deduct one star because it took a good 5 to 10 minutes until we were greeted.  After that there were no issues though.Overall, the entire experience gets a 3.5 out of 5. I really wish that yelp would go to half stars because this place does deserve another half star.  However, it was closer to 3 than 4 for me."
"5.0","Stopped into grab a quick bite to eat and drink after the Pirates game but ended up staying for hours.THE FOOD IS AMAZING!!!!!!We had the goat cheese fritters (2 orders because they were so damn good), the cheese plate, the duck filled dumpling, tacos and the BBQ ribs. O.M.G. All awesome.For a beverage, I highly suggest the Moscow mule. Tito's on tap. What whaaaaaattt!You will not regret coming here!"
"5.0","the food here is AMAZING! the portions are incredible. I paid around $10 for a huge platter that could probably last a few days if I wanted to. there's a nice market next door with a huge selection as well! the food options are numerous, but what I ordered was the chili chicken, chicken tikka masala, naan, spinach paneer, and rice. the chili chicken was by far my favorite and definitely recommend getting that. the naan was HUGE, fluffy, and perfectly buttery. there are mediterranean and south asian options.on top of having perfect food, the staff is so friendly. it's a super fast paced food joint and they're really nice when you're ordering, which is ideal. this will definitely be my regular spot whenever I am in Pittsburgh"
"5.0","AMAZING Food and great service. We stopped by during a conference with a medium sized group and we're treated very well. Will return."

"3.0","I like this eat n park because they have the midnight buffet on Friday and Saturday nights! It's always fun and interesting to stop in and eat with the late night crowd. The late night buffet has breakfast items and soups and some salad ingredients. You can order the buffet until three am, you can also order from the regular menu as well.  The food is ok, it's eat n park so it's better than fast food but not five star restaurant food. The service is spotty depending on the server but it is open 24 hours so  that's always a plus."
"5.0","Best spicy fried chicken everrrrrrrrr and I've tried them all! We ordered the large order of chicken tenders with medium spice and it was great for two people. Wooo my tongue burns still so medium is definitely not for the faint of heart. How do ppl go beyond medium?!? Will need to try their sandwich and fries next time we're in Pitt! Cute space with a cool upstairs area. Service is great. Parking is all street."
"5.0","Eating here right now and I had to write a review. We waiting in line for DeLuca's but it was super long so we looked next door and saw their special of 2 Eggs of Beef Brisket Hash. Done deal, we went inside.We had a big group but the cashier/staff were SUPER nice. Like incredibly nice and pleasant. Food was INCREDIBLE. Brisket hash was amazing. Blueberry Ricotta pancakes were incredible as well.HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Screw DeLuca's, just stop next door and skip the wait."
"2.0","So I know this is an Eat N Park but we just stopped here for breakfast. Ordered two original breakfast smiles they were cooked to our preference and tasty as expected. No issues with the food but the service was horrible!!! We were pressed for time so when we got our food we asked for our check and then the waitress disappeared we didn't see her when we were eating and waited 10 minutes after we finished when we finally saw her and then asked for our check again. She brought us the wrong check and then we were told we would have to wait and she would have to cash us out By this point we were irritated and waited long enough left money then left.It really takes me a lot to get annoyed at a restaurant but it was ridiculous how long we waited and asked ahead of time to make sure we didn't have to wait. We ended up being late to the place we needed to go"
"1.0","Spend your money somewhere else. The food is super salty and overpriced for what it is. Drinks take a long time to come, like 20 minutes. I've tried to like this place, really, but the last straw was the grouchy manager who was seemingly reprimanding a server on the floor? In this wonderfully diverse and vibrant food city, there are a ton of great places to eat... check out some place else."
"4.0","Tried the bread pudding and it was the best chocolate bread pudding I hav had so far..taking away a star cos service was kinda slow but food was awesome!"
"4.0","Holy shit is this chicken hot! I a am normally a huge fan of spicy food but the medium left a persistent burning in my mouth that was hard to get rid of.  Definitely order one level down what you would normally like in terms of spice level.  If medium is this hot then mild must be pretty spicy too. Normally on a 1-10 scale I usually get about a 7 but this tasted like a 9/10 level of spice. I liked that there were options for tenders, sandwich, chicken and waffles or a chicken salad and a few sides to choose from such as fries or mac n cheese.  Service was prompt and there was plenty of seating. Would have liked the chicken to be slightly crispier though."
"3.0","I just needed a quick lunch on my way into work, and let's be honest, it is what it is.  It's a Subway, you can't fault it at that.  All items are the same from Subway to Subway.  I already know when I walk in here I'm not going to get a gourmet meal.I get my usual, top it my usual way and have no complications.  So I really can't complain past the fact that I stopped at a Subway for lunch."
"5.0","I've stopped in a few times for cupcakes and decided to have Natalie cater my baby shower tea party.  She made amazing mini cupcakes and let me choose any flavors I could imagine (went with chai w/cinnamon frosting, pistachio, lemon raspberry, and chocolate hazelnut).  She also made delicious scones and finger sandwiches.  The egg salad was amazing & their homemade pesto in the caprese sandwiches was excellent.  This our new go-to cafe in the neighborhood!"
"5.0","Melissa is the best bartender I've ever had. She listens to what the customer wants exactly. She is so personable and makes you feel at home! I a going to request her from on now. Happy customer"
"5.0","Awesome!  My kids and I had a great time here to try some food that isn't from a chain restaurant (we live in the north hills and chains are all we have). This was really fun...we each picked a different dish as our favorite.  The waiter explained everything and it was a great, enjoyable experience!"
"5.0","I can't say enough about Merante's and Maria. The back of the shop has wonderful baked goods. Pies, breads and of course the best biscotti around! Though, the true treasure exists in the upstairs apartment where Maria has cooking classes and serves a 6 course meal to parties of  8-10 most nights of the week. I heard about the private parties while at a food tour of Bloomfield. I knew I needed to get a reservation but, I had no idea how difficult that task would be. We scheduled a dinner in October for the first available Friday or Saturday which was 6 months later! That's right folks, 6 months in advance! The menu changes seasonally and is posted on the website. We ordered earlier in the week so that Maria had time to purchase the necessary items and prepare our meal. The menu would typically be the same for all 8 in the party but, Maria graciously offered to allow us to split the entrees into a meat and a non meat option to allow those who don't eat meat on Fridays during lent to have another option. When we arrived, we all enjoyed the appetizers in a sitting room at the front of the apartment. The appetizers themselves were a meal- meatballs, bread, shrimp, spinach pie, stuffed tomatoes and cheese with roasted peppers- all of which were incredible. Bring along your wine as Merante's is BYOB. The next course was soup which we were served in the formal dinning room which opened to the small kitchen where Maria cooks your meal. At first it was a little awkward sitting so close to the kitchen and Maria. Imagine having dinner at your grandmother's home with 7  of your closest friends. But, Maria did a great job of giving us our privacy. We hardly even noticed that she was there. After the soup came the pasta (homemade gnocchi anyone?), then the entrees and vegetables, then the salad and last, the dessert. This was a meal fit for a king! The portions were huge! Luckily, Maria boxed up the leftovers making for an easy lunch the next day. If your lucky, you may even get to take home a little extra something such as extra sauce or a homemade truffle. Absolutely everything about this dinner was perfection. Everything (from the food to the service and hospitality) was done with the utmost care and concern to ensure a wonderful experience. I would literally come here every month if it were possible. Unfortunately, Maria is booked through the end of 2014! Not one day available in the next 8 months! My only complaint, Maria is in serious need of a clone."
"5.0","Elegantly amazing!Served promptly with a cordial smile by the hostess.Dim lighting with a prestigious ambience of a masculinely formal decor. Decadent array of selections ranging from land to sea. The seafood platter was perfectly chilled with seasonings to delight your palette. The wine menu had many choices from different regions that allowed pairing from afar to local blends. The chef selection of bone in rib eye was perfectly cooked to medium and the lamb was so tasty that there was no gamy flavoring in them. The dessert menu was to die for! I'd pick the double chocolate cake. Our waitress Katie provided great service with proper etiquette which holds high stars in my book with the use of proper verbiage of please and thank you's! Highly recommended!!!!"
"5.0","Disgustingly amazing breakfast as usual. Order what you want and accept you are done for the day!"
"5.0","Great stop before attending the symphony this evening. The Little Man wanted to go someplace different for our customary before music meal, and he picked Redbeards. We were seated quickly, and when I explained to the server we had a concert to stt st nd in about an hour, he quickly took our drink and meal orders. The lad decided on the blackened salmon over rice with green beans, and I went with their hot pepper plate.Great selections both. The boy really enjoyed his seasoned spicey dish, even insisting I try a bite. Wow - terrific! My peppers were hot and great, served with some delicious tomato pasta twists and garlic toast. It was all out in z jiff, but with nice presentation...and delicious all!A quick and very reasonable bill (gee...that's all?) and we were at the hall for some excellent Beethoven with time to spare.Well done...great service, great food, and at a reasonable price. It helped make for a great evening!"
"5.0","My rating is a 4.5 that gets rounded up to a 5.  You will definitely not be impressed with the cafeteria style atmosphere, but it is comfortable and you are there for the food, not the decor.Speaking of food, you get a ton of it for a great price.  The 2 curry, rice and vegetable combo is my favorite way to go.  I've had enough food to either indulge myself in one sitting and not have to eat another meal the rest of the day, or eat half, and then finish the rest as another meal later in the day - pick your poison.The best thing in my opinion is the chili chicken.  The beef and chicken samosas are delectable and the wraps are delicious too.The people working there were pretty nice as well.  Sometimes, they run out of a certain popular item and need to make a new batch, but they will bring it to your table as soon as it's ready to go.Shame I only found out about this place during my last few months in Pittsburgh, or else I can see myself eating here at least once a week on the regular."
"2.0","I really want to like this place but on 2 occasions in a row now I've ordered the daily and/or game special and have been charged the full price by the same bartender. You shouldn't have to request the for the special pricing. Needless to say the food is good and the atmosphere is pleasing."
"5.0","We just returned for a follow-up visit to Tamarind and a chance to use our Groupon (since we somehow forgot we had it the first time we went back in May).  It was crowded for a Sunday night, but that is my experience with Groupons in their last valid days: places get packed.But Tamarind is deserving of the crowds.  This place serves legitimately awesome Indian food, served by a really friendly staff who knows how to take care of you, and educate you about your food as well, if you'd like.One of the unique things about Tamarind is the inclusion of dosas on their menu.  We'd never had (or even heard about) dosas before coming here, but we have now tried two of them, and loved both!  The dosas are large, flat, crepe-like breads served with different sauces for dipping.  We tried the cilantro dosa first, which was seasoned but not stuffed, and last night tried the madras masala dosa, which was stuffed with potatoes, lentils, and onions.  Oh, it was so good (but I do recommend splitting it, as it was also huge!).They also do your standard Indian dishes very well: we had samosas on our first visit, and they were exactly how samosas were intended to be, with a light, crispy outside and a hearty filling inside.  The naan is EXCELLENT, puffy and buttered and garlicky as can be (the garlic naan, that is, we haven't tried any other varieties because the garlic was so good).Both times, my husband has gotten tandoori entrees.  He is a meat-eater, while I always prefer vegetarian Indian options.  Both the chicken tikka and the seekh kabab were served steaming hot and cooked to perfection.I got the mattar paneer first, and the aloo gobi masala on our second visit.  At each meal, I felt so full, but couldn't hold back from eating more because the flavors were so good.  What I loved about the aloo gobi masala (potatoes and cauliflower) was the sensation that you were eating something really spicy, without the actual super-spiciness that leaves you sweating and gulping water.  I presume this must be an ancient Indian secret, but I am definitely content to keep coming back to try to figure out the mystery :)Tamarind is BYOB, which is another nice touch.  It's $5 for a bottle of wine, and they will uncork it and bring you glasses while you peruse the menu.Last night, it was extremely busy (they do take reservations though, so especially if you go on a Friday or Saturday night, this is your best bet), and somewhere in the shuffle our garlic naan got sent to the wrong table.  Our waitress noticed immediately that we were without bread, so she apologized, got the chef to toss together some fresh, too-hot-to-touch garlic naan in minutes, and actually took the item off the bill for us to make up for the delay!  See what I mean about awesome waitstaff?I'm not sure that there is an actual parking lot, but there is ample street parking just nearby, and it's on bus lines as well.  Tamarind is set in a lovely old house, so you get the feeling that you've been invited to a friend's dining room for dinner, which I love.  Needless to say, we will definitely be back!  :)"
"4.0","I was a little surprised by the lackluster reviews for Alexanders on here. I've only been there once, but I was quite pleased with the experience.From the second I entered the restaurant, I was greeted in a very friendly manner. Service to my table was also prompt and amicable.There is quite a bit of variety on the menu, and the prices are reasonable. I had the Tortellini Verde and my friend had the Mafalda Madison (thankfully I was able to sample this a bit too). I thought both were flavorful and tasty. Granted, I'm not an Italian food connoisseur, but it was definitely comparable if not better than other Mom & Pop Italian places I've been to. It certainly blows Olive Garden out of the water, but perhaps that goes without saying.I will definitely go back!"
"1.0","Nasty!!! Would you like a side of hair with that?I found a flyer in my mail and said to my family of 6 that we are going to order pizza for lunch. We had a huge ordered once it got here they did not send what we ordered and the worst part was my 11 year old found a HAIR in his food. So as you know we called and they said they would give us a discount on the next order! We have no plans to EVER order from there again!! There are so many other places who take care of their customers better ...not to mention NEW customer!"
"3.0","I had been wanting to check this place out for a long time! I have heard such great things about the food and the beer! First of all, the space is super cute! It is very small and we had a large group of people attending for a going away party on a sunday evening but we did not make a reservation. The beer selection was small but the beer was very good. The food was also excellent, I got the diner burger and a few in our party got the beef brisket which looked awesome and so did the schnitzel sandwich! The only reason I did not give this review a higher rather is because the service was not good. The entire group that I was with are all current or previous bartenders and servers so we understand being busy and how the restaurant industry works! It was a slow sunday evening and our large group of friends seemed annoy the waitress whose section we ended up in which was on the main floor near the bar. They didn't seem to want to wait on us and finally offered us a private second floor space which was great! Being that it was slow, we thought that perhaps the waitress would be excited to make money off of us but she did not come by very often and half of our group had to make frequent trips down to the bar to keep fresh drinks. The place closed at 10:00pm and the waitress brought us checks by 9:00pm not even offering last call, clearly wanting to be done with her shift. Overall, i would go back for the food and give it another shot!"
"3.0","Not everyday I get thw chance eat lunch with a bear and moose elk head! I came in for lunch around 11:45.  We were promptly seated up stairs. The room had killer blue lights and had kind of a night clubby feel.  We got dine with stuffed bear and moose/ elk head! Totally made my after noon.I ordered the crab cake sandwich (my lunch goto)But id also love to seafood pasta or shrimp po' both lookes pretty tasty also."
"3.0","This was my favorite restaurant until last night. White bean dip was served with slices of rye bread instead of the usual that they serve. This showed me they did not want us there. Waitress was rude und it took her awhile to take our order. I have told a lot of people about this place, but will not go back."
"4.0","One of the best Indian restaurants in Pitts! Great food !"
"4.0","Amazing food. Lots of variety. Very nice employees​. Very good customer service. Highly recommended​..One star less because I've had better somewhere else. but this is one of the bests in Pittsburgh."
"4.0","Excellent selection for the most part.  But one does need to know how to buy in a fish area as issues of freshness become apparent at times.  Staff generally courteous and helpful.  The Shrimp area ... need to go back again and see the selection.  Location iconic to Pittsburgh with ample parking within 2 blocks."
"4.0","Really good food and short wait time, even at the peak of the lunch hour. For the price, I wish there was less rice and not of the meat and/or other fillings. (About $10.50 for a bowl including a protein.)"
"5.0","I would have to say Doce has the best Tacos and Nachos in Pittsburgh. It's a little hole in wall feel fast service very limited seating and no alcohol. Over the tacos are cheap and extremely good. They usally have  a taco of the day. Today they had a California Brisket Taco and it was amazing. Highly recommend for a fast food option while in the SouthSide!"
"4.0","I like Luke Wholey's and my service was excellent, but I can see where you could have a 'totally worth it' or a 'totally not worth it' experience based on what you order.   What appears to be 'worth it'  - Happy hour drink specials - $5 house wines and 1/2 priced cocktails were a sure winner- The sushi options looked great and the prices weren't too out of line.  - Some of the starters.  What wasn't 'worth it'- The entrees - priced at $26-$36 on average, the few I tried didn't really blow me away.  It looks like a lot of food, but it's really just normal portions of fish and veg, with a double portion of starch.   - The specials - order with caution! - prices are not disclosed in the descriptions, so I accidentally ordered $30 worth of King Crab legs (1/2 lb that was described as an appetizer portion) along with a $32 entrée (stuffed shrimp that I wouldn't have knowingly paid that much for).    Overall, I'd go back, but with more of an eye toward ordering stuff in the 'worth it' category."
"2.0","i have had so much bad luck with this pizza place    so i stayed away itryed again and sooo disappointed the french fries were so burnt and tasted like they were cooked in old grease the tomatoes on the hoagies were not ripe they were green in some spots they need to get their act together i spend alot on pizza and hoagies they wont get my business any more i tryed to give them a chance you blow it wise guys"
"5.0","What a little gem!Ordered the Sandwich & Drink special for only $7.05! The servers were friendly and helpful. Some of the baguettes are pre-made with butter (which I can't have for lactose). But the server offered to make me one fresh with mayonnaise instead! I had the Prosciutto and Pickle - bread was light and fresh but had that good French chew to it. Meat and pickle complemented each other perfectly.Nice and chill vibe. I'd come back."
"5.0","I do like this place. A lot. You can sit at the bar or grab a cozy booth. The drinks are very good and their food isn't bad either. The atmosphere is very nice. In the summer, it feels like an enclosed patio due to open windows. Never stuffy, always nice and breezy. In the winter, it's beautiful and decorated nicely for Christmas. I've been here twice and I'll definitely be back. The restroom is a bit different. It's downstairs and the stairs are shallow. Not the place to get a good buzz going and then decide you have to use the restroom."
"4.0","After waiting for a while in a fast paced line, we ordered Kufta and Lamb Shank for the main course and Pistachio Bird Nest for dessert. The food was delicious. The portions were huge. Kufta was too spicy. I like spicy food. However, I think that a restaurant should mention on the menu when a dish is more spicy than would be expected. This is the reason that I deducted one star. The service was good and fast. Of course, considering the self-service nature of the place and especially this very fact that no tips are asked or expected. Certainly, this place is not a good place for a date or sentimental meeting. But a good place if you just want to try a huge middle eastern meal with a decent cost."
"4.0","The best Indian food that I've had in Pittsburgh hitherto. I ordered one of specials of the day - goat briyani. The goat was very soft and tender. The dish itself was pleasantly spiced and herbed (I cannot neglect the fresh cilantro), and it came with a light yogurt-type sauce. It was a large portion too. The only drawback is the price. My entree plus tip costed $20. I'd be interested in returning for the lunch buffet which costs half the price, or I might return for student night (on wednesday) when the second entree is half off."
"3.0","Cafe Phipps has a very upscale cafeteria like vibe.  Located adjacent to the gardens of Phipps, the location is really nice in that you can hit this place up before or after you check out Phipps.  We came here for happy hour on a Friday and were pleased with the limited, yet, extremely tasty drink and food options.  In particular, the fried mushroom/cheese balls were tremendous.  Pricing was extremely fair.  It's essentially self-serve, which isn't a bad thing.  Just don't come here expecting a tremendously upscale dining experience.  It's low key and simple, yet clean and efficient.  All in all, unless you're coming here to check out the Conservatory, I wouldn't go out of your way to make it to this spot."
"5.0","Went back to get treats for friends. The macrons were great! The outside crisp, but inside nice and chewy with a great assortment of flavors. I ended up with the chocolate banana, and even not being a banana fan, I found it to be quite good. I also had a bostock which was quite good. Crisp, satisfying and something you won't find just anywhere."
"5.0","Love this place; not fancy, but you get an enormous amount of delicious middle-Eastern/Indian food under 10 bucks. The staff is friendly and helpful if you have any questions about the dishes. My favorite is the saag panneer and stewed chick peas. It's enough for 3 meals."
"5.0","This is my favorite bar in the mount and one of my favorite bars in all of Pittsburgh. The featured cocktails are all delicious. Seriously, you can't go wrong. Especially if you show your face during happy hour where all featured drinks are a measly $6 (Just an FYI: I'm planning on naming my first born Leora, because that drink is my world).Hoity toity snooty pants mixologists slinging bespoke drinks with a side of pretension make me want to cry in my tumbler. But you don't have to worry about that here. You'll get a darn good bespoke drink if you ask for it, but the bartenders are lovely and down to Earth. These are craft cocktails done right. Food is great as well. Some of my faves include the Elote Dip, Goat Cheese Fritters, and everything on the brunch menu. Menu items change seasonally so there's always something new to try. This bar has been such a great addition to the neighborhood. Whether you want to unwind with coworkers over some board games and drinks, or you're trying to impress a date or out-of-towner with dinner, The Summit has you covered."
"5.0","best wonton soup in the city.  amazing egg rolls.  sweet aquarium up front.  delicious broccoli with garlic sauce (don't judge me for ordering this).  i will always say 'yes' to coming here!!!  parking can be a bitch, but you're downtown -- so it's no surprise/fault of chinatown inn."
"5.0","We came in for sandwiches shortly before closing, and when it started to rain outside (ruining our plans for a picnic), Deirdre let us stay after closing to eat inside the market. Sandwiches were delicious and I look forward to coming back for coffee, food, or groceries!"
"4.0","A decent spot in Bloomfield. The restaurant space is a little dated and there was an odd smell when we were there. Staff was friendly and service was good. They gave us an oil/pesto mix with our bread, it was fantastic. I had the pasta with the 'Marfredo' sauce (a mix of marina and afredo). The sauce was great and the meatballs were just okay for me. The pasta portions are definitely enough to split or to have some leftovers. Worth checking out."
"3.0","I had tamarinds saag before. It was really good. Last time I ordered a biryani thru Grubhub takeout. It was very spicy but without much flavor. Very salty and had large dried up pieces of chicken. I was disappointed w their food."
"4.0","I wouldn't have figured that Pittsburgh would have good sushi, but I have found it.  I was in town for work and wanting something yummy.  I looked it up and decided to go.  I sat at the sushi bar, ordered an uni and unagi to start and followed that with sushi chirashi.  It was all excellent.  I don't usually get dessert, but opted for green tea ice cream to finish off the meal.You should know that it is in some sort of mall.  That wasn't clear, and Station Square has a lot of chain restaurants.  There is a parking garage across from The Sheraton and mall that you can park and walk across the street.  Parking was pretty cheap."
"4.0","This is by far my favorite place to eat in the Steel building.  The service is always fast and the people working here are very friendly and seem to have a lot of fun while working together.The breakfast sandwiches are all very good and made fresh.  For lunch, my favorite is either the Buffalo shrimp wrap or the steak and blue sandwich (I sub ranch for the blue cheese).  Every sandwich I have tried has always been great.  The fresh cut fries are a perfect compliment to the large sandwiches.  They have a station where you can add vinegar and Cajun seasoning which I would recommend.  They also have great ranch dressing that goes well with the fries.It is a little pricy, however the portions are huge.  You could split a sandwich and fries with another person and be full.  If you eat a full sandwich and fries by yourself, you will be sleeping the rest of your work day."
"5.0","If you want the freshest, highest quality Arabic/Indian food in the city, go to Salem's in the Strip District.  Walk down the line of food and select what you want from a variety of chicken, lamb, vegetables, and rice.  I honestly feel Salem's gets better each time I go and I assure you, I've been there a lot. I frequented the original location in Oakland for many years until they closed it and built the 'new' one.  The food and service is outstanding.  The market next door is equally as impressive.  They carry the best pita bread in the universe - Pitaland.  The interior seating isn't suitable for a 'fancy' dinner so I wouldn't recommend bringing a first date here but if you can get past that, which you should, Salem's is a MUST."
"5.0","One of the newest taco spots in the Pittsburgh area has really come out swinging.  Very excellent food inside a small location with hands on service. I'm a taco fan and this place will have me coming back time and time again."
"5.0","Myself and the group of people I went with thoroughly enjoyed Luke Wholey's, great food, fun atmosphere and a strong staff. I recommend it if you're in the Pittsburgh area and looking for good quality seafood especially the king crab legs, phenomenal"
"4.0","Friendly and quick service. In and out. Spacious store. Well put sandwich together and not soggy after I get home with the dressing in it. I will be back though my only gripe is parking is not so easy so you have to park on the street. Yay for Subway's $5 footlong. Fantastic deal and fresh. Can't be beat. I agree with Ronald."
"5.0","I really enjoyed this place very much. Service was top notch. Staff was super professional and very friendly. We got the lunch special. $12.75 for any whole sandwich, choice of side, drink and a homemade cookie. I chose the pastrami. It was warm and toasted and tasted very good. Lean cuts of warm pastrami sliced thin on premium bread with melted cheese and a generous amounts of whole grain mustard, lettuce and tomato, all fresh. My friend got a turkey sandwich. It looked like the sandwich belonged on the cover of a food blog. The care taken to make both sandwiches was great. Red velvet cookie was perfect and pasta salad was amazing. Will return very soon."
"5.0","a whole mf nut. i got the special & the chicken tacos. my mouth is still burning from the habenaro mustard but it's a good burning, a sensational burning. 10/10 would burn again. if you come here make sure that you get at least one special, you won't be disappointed. good music too, i ate tacos to some old blink 182. good for the soul."
"4.0","Another awesome meal. Had the kufta kebab meal which came with huge side of rice and 3 kebabs that were sublime. Not greasy and cooked perfectly. Also had the garlic Naan which was hot out of the over and it was the bomb!  Just go there an eat ,you won't be sorry."
"5.0","This has quickly become one of my go to spots.The cocktail and beer menu is extensive. Their old fashions are the perfect balance of sweet and bourbon, neither overpowering the other. I highly recommend coming for their happy hour. Cocktails are $6 and you can get a pound of mussels for $8. Can't beat that. And, to top it all off, they have a bunch of board games that you bring to your table."
"5.0","Love the atmosphere of this brunch location. The iced coffee is delicious! I drink endless amounts of it when I'm there. The staff and owners are always friendly. I got the chicken pesto salad, and it was amazing. Would highly recommend, I'll keep coming back."
"4.0","My friend and I decided to stop in here for drinks one evening last week, and I am so glad we did! The menu features a selection of specialty cocktails (with a few classics included). It's not every day that you find happy hour pricing on craft cocktails, so we were happy to find that The Summit is an exception; I think we paid about $6 per drink which is really a steal considering the quality.It's a small space but the large windows/garage doors give it a breezy and open feeling; we had the benefit of being here on a beautiful day. The bartenders were both friendly, welcoming, and made great suggestions. We were here around 6 on a Thursday, and I'm honestly very surprised that it was not busier. I had an excellent spicy Paloma which combined grapefruit, tequila, and jalapeno. It was fantastic! They did not hold back on the heat which I appreciate; as a lover of hot foods, if you're going to describe an item as spicy, then it better live up to the description!We only came for drinks, but the food menu was tempting and will be the reason for my return visit. I don't make it to Mt. Washington often, however this gives me yet another reason to hop on the incline and pay a visit."
"3.0","Food = 5 stars.  Wait time = 2 stars.Okay, I finally made it here.  My sandwich was amazing and excellent (more details below).  However, it took 41 minutes from order time until our two sandwiches came out, and it was just not that busy.The service was otherwise very good - friendly crew, easy going and helpful, etc.  But the fries came out in 10 minutes, and it took 31 more to get two, standard sandwiches.  That's just a bit broken.FOOD:  Excellent.  I got the No. 7 (a.k.a., 'the Roethlisberger'), and it did not disappoint.  The bread is a standout - so fresh, so soft.  The meats were great - a mix of ground beef and spicy sausage, served piping hot and just delicious.  I was unsure about the egg part, but it worked - it's not really a fried egg - more like scrambled on the flattop, and spread out flat, so it forms another layer.My lovely wife got a Pepper Steak, add mushrooms.  She rated it highly as well.  One note:  the cheesesteaks can come with lettuce and tomato if you're into that, versus without, as is more traditional for a cheesesteak.I will try again, but the 40+ minute wait (I really timed it, yes) could be a deal-killer.  Let's hope it was a one-off.  If so, I'll be glad to update my review."
"3.0","i've lived in pittsburgh 4 years and surprisingly ive never tried chinatown inn. I have my usual chinese spots and i normally dont steer away from them. Today however, i was in the mood for chinese but remembered that i only had enough bus fare to get home rather than an unlimited pass.. so taking a bus to my usual chinese place was out of the question. I had my mind set on chinese so i decided to try out chinatown inn since a coworker raves about it.I ordered my usual-- general tsos lunch special. You get to choose soup or egg roll. I chose a chicken egg roll and ohmygoooooodness it was huge.. like the size of my fist. I also had the option of white or fried rice and went with fried. The lobby as well as the dining area seemed nice.. The girl who took my order was very kind as well as the gentleman who brought it out (in 5 minutes with no call-ahead, wooh!)The main reason for only 3 stars is i didnt really care for the food :\ My chicken was tasty but i did not care for the general tsos sauce. It was super thin and extremely sweet. im used to a spicy, thicker(sticky) sauce. Also, the fried rice had one (tiny) piece of onion.. i didnt see any egg or carrots, ect... just rice and bean sprouts. Finally, every chinese joint i've been to i had enough for lunch + some leftover. Chinatown inn offered same food, same price but smaller portions. I may head back to try out something else or just stick with the egg rolls. The food was not bad but it wasnt my taste. If you like sweet general tsos sauce then you will probably like it :)"
"5.0","This bakery is such a gem! My daughter and I were in town to see a show and stopped to get coffee this morning. I got the almond croissant and a dozen of their little choux to go. The choux was perfect! Not too sweet, bite sized, and perhaps too easy to eat. The almond croissant does look a little flat, like others have said. But the flavor! And the denser, slightly chewy texture! It's a must try! This was our first time in Pittsburgh, and I seriously regret not buying at least a dozen of them. The staff was super nice, too!"
"3.0","Average sushi restaurant - food ok, not really the freshest.  Prices very reasonable."
"3.0","ordered for lunch at work, nice walk from CHP. Good prices, includes choice of spring roll and soup. I ordered the tom yum noodle soup, it was soo good!! But of course, we were lacking suitable utensils and bowls in our office so it was quite the show to see us attempt to eat our dishes. a coworker stated her pad thai was a bit on the dry side, but otherwise good. the spring roll and won ton soup were excellent. will definitely go back! but with my own utensils!"
"4.0","I am on a Sushi Kick!    The location was very quiet on a Tuesday Night.    We order some sushi.   I ordered spicy tuna rolls, yellow tail, and salmon. Are were very good.     The kitchen had a spicy relish Sriracha spiced salsa which provided a much needed texture difference.I had this coupled with a 2 bottles of warm sake.   LIfe was good.If you are in the Station Square Area (my first time) and crave sushi.   I would recommend this place.Atmosphere - not many people in the restaurant - very quiet.Service - Awesome.   Our server made sure we received our food and libations.Price - $12-15 per roll, $4-6 for individual pieces (large in size)"
"4.0","Always a good time here.  Great food, lots of big tvs and of course delicious adult beverages."
"5.0","Cafe Raymond was a great breakfast spot in a pinch. We were looking for a place around market Square early on a Saturday morning. But we couldn't find anything we liked as much in the business District was closed. So we drove about a mile out of Center City to café Raymond to have breakfast.The pastries were phenomenal. My mother got a very light lemon pastry. We all had regular breakfast as well. The potatoes were definitely the best part, they were seasoned to perfection. The line at the register went quickly, as you were before you sit down."
"5.0","I've been meaning to try out this restaurant for over a year and finely found an opportunity to use a Restaurant.com coupon. It was just the two of us on a weekday for dinner. The place was moderately busy, with good turnover in tables. My only complaint would be that the waitstaff seemed scattered, and the person who took our order was not the person checking us out at the end of the meal.We started with the idly (lentil patties), which were more like pancakes than what I had imagined--very carby. After being adventurous with the appetizer, we were less so with our entrees: korma for me, tandoori chicken for him (it came out sizzling!). Both were more food than we could eat, so we took home leftovers for lunch the next day.The menu was sufficiently long that I would like to come back and try something else next time. Unpretentious place to have a nice meal alone, on a date, or with the family that won't break the bank."
"4.0","We tried Doce Taqueria this past weekend after hearing about it from a neighbor/friend on the Southside. We were very happy with our dinner and the price was great. Everything was very fresh and we both agreed that the pork tacos are the way to go (much more flavor than the chicken). You MUST try to the black beans! The restaurant is small, so consider ordering to-go if you have a group.My only complaint is the lack of drink options. They only had a cooler stocked with bottled sodas and iced tea. I would have loved an ice-cold fountain drink to go with my tacos. We even considered going across the street to DQ to grap a diet coke. Overall, it's definitely something you should try. There's nothing better than fresh, flavorful Mexican food."
"1.0","Genarros is the worst. The act like they care but they don't. I ordered a simple cheese pizza and had to wait an hour and a half and watch others getting served way before me. They don't respect their customers. Never coming here again"
"5.0","I got the lamb nan shawarma, and it was delicious. I think I ate a third of it before I got full - it was HUGE. The nan/naan was nice and thick with lots of meat and veggies inside, and the garlic sauce is really good. The hummus was awesome as well, and I got a box of their assorted baklava to go. One of the guys are the counter kindly told me what all the different types of baklava were even though he was slightly busy doing something else. You can tell they're very family friendly, and this is definitely a gem in the strip district! If you're ever craving middle eastern food, you need to try it! PS I also heard they have the best butchers in the city? I'm not from Pitt so I'm only visiting whenever I'm there, but great for you locals!"
"4.0","Cafe Phipps located inside the Phipps Conservatory on the main level is offering a fixed price menu of 4 courses on Friday nights during the month of March for 65.00 per person which includes the dinner and admission to the conservatory which stays open til 10pm on Fridays.  The hostess indicated this is something they plan to continue monthly with the menu options varying.We made reservations and arrived early with no problems getting seated.  They have cordoned off a section of the cafe with a privacy partition for the guests with reservations while keeping the rest open for normal cafe operations.  The tables have tablecloths and the table is nicely set with wine glasses and beautiful napkins.  We started our meal with glasses of wine (price additional to the fixed price meal).  The first course was a warm artichoke and roasted red pepper risotto.  This was delicious and an ample serving.  I should interrupt here just as our diner was interrupted.  Suddenly a fire alarm went off in the building.  Everyone just looked at one another with no one moving.  Ok.... I was taught, as good measure, that one should get their butt up and head to the exit in such a case so I donned my coat and headed out.  I do think the staff should be better instructed to not only get their butts out the door but ensure their patrons do, as well.  That was irksome on a safety level.  Within 15 minutes, the all-clear was given (our server later indicated something in the basement had triggered it).  Anyway, I did my part and my husband followed suit a wee bit after me reluctantly and then we did finally return to our table.Ok, onto the 2nd course.  The 2nd course was our choice of either a house salad or a mushroom soup.  I selected the salad while my husband opted for the soup.  Both were adequate but I should have asked for additional salad dressing (a vinaigrette)The 3rd course was the entree -- I opted for the crab cake and asparagus, my husband selected the filet with asparagus.  Both were good.  I can't say the crab cake was like any other I've had, but it was good.The 4th and final course was dessert -- a warn blueberry cobber with ice cream.  It was good but not as sweet as either of us would have liked.Afterwards, we had plenty of time to visit the gift shop and the convervatory which was sponsoring orchids and bonsai.  I like this concept of a very nice dinner and journey through the convervatory -- makes for a truly great date night.  Oh, and another plus?  When you are finished with dinner they give you your complementary conservatory ticket and it's good thru the end of the year -- not just that night.  I like that!"
"4.0","Yeah, I'm a fan. This was my first time to Cafe Raymond and it was a very enjoyable experience. We went to Sunday Brunch after church and arrived at about 12:30 p.m. to almost a full house. It's a long fairly galley style space with the ordering line and kitchen on the left side of the room and a long line of 2-person tables along the right side. The entire place smelled of delicious bacon when we entered and inspired my husband to order the BLT. I ordered a cup of hot tea and was given a cup of boiled water and shown to the tea station where they had several types of upscale tea bags in various flavors. I chose a traditional Earl Grey and it was a very good cup of tea - they also had lemon, milk and sugar for those wanting to doctor their tea up. I had read about the fantastic Blueberry Ricotta pancakes and decided I would try those; my husband got the BLT with roasted potatoes on the side and a delicious fresh crunchy dill pickle spear. The pancakes weren't the end-all and be-all of pancakes, but they were quite good. I will definitely be moving on to trying some of their sandwiches next time. During our time there I had the chance to speak with a couple of the lovely girls who work there and they were both very friendly and helpful. One of the best perks about this place is that they have nice restrooms in the basement with elevator (or stairs) access. This is important for me as I have mobility challenges and stairs are super taxing on me. It's great to find a restroom in the Strip District and especially one for folks who can't do stairs.I will definitely return to Cafe Raymond as we had a great Brunch meal and an all-round enjoyable experience."
"4.0","The lunch buffet is a really good deal, and great for anyone needing a quick reprieve from the hospital/university. There aren't tons of options, but the ones they do have are mostly vegetarian! The tea and desserts that are a part of the buffet are excellent, especially the mango and rice desserts which are my favorite part of the meal! There are also a lot of nice chutneys. If you're in a pinch, you can get the UPMC WiFi within the restaurant and bang out some work."
"5.0","Two friends and I dined at Sausalido for a birthday and we had a perfect experience. Our reservation was at 6:45 on a Friday evening, but we arrived half an hour early and were still seated right away. I wish I remember our server's name, she was fantastic. Genuine, helpful, attentive and personable - but most importantly, non-intrusive.We brought several bottles of wine and spent three hours eating delicious food, chatting it up and just really enjoying the atmosphere. It's very intimate, a quiet place - although after all the wine was gone, we were making an effort to keep the volume low.We split the smoked gouda appetizer, and that was a great idea. It comes over sauteed spinach and it was fantastic. The special of the day was shark and my friends were obsessed. They raved about it. I did the shrimp risotto and I couldn't have been happier. I took half of it home, as the portions are huge (and it was just as good at 10am). It also comes with a side salad that doesn't disappoint either. - or you can sub soup for $2. Either way, great options. And then we had dessert, which never happens - but staring at pictures on Yelp all day and we couldn't help ourselves. The caramel cheesecake was beyond delicious. I honestly don't think anything on the menu would have been a bad idea.Our check ended up being less than $37 a person - which is just amazing for the great service and full three courses plus added soup/coffee and the cork fees. I think you should eat here immediately."
"4.0","Delicious food and great value. We came for breakfast and I had an omelette with bacon, mushrooms and gruyere. It was wonderful and I could only finish half it was so large. My bf had blueberry ricotta pancakes and they were amazing as well. Definitely recommend  Cafe Raymond for breakfast!"
"5.0","Wow. This is a diamond in the rough in a place I wouldn't expect to have legit ethnic fare. I highly recommend this place! We ordered two nights in a row because it was sooooo good. My top picks: baingan bartha  and paneer Tikka masala."
"4.0","This Pamela's has a much different environment than the one in Oakland. This had a much more intimate feel and was a lot smaller and less 'diner' -esque. The morning after breakfast special was pretty good with 2 large hotcakes (important sidenote: if a pancake and a crepe had children I would imagine this is what their child would look like, the outside and edges are crispy but it's thick enough to be considered a pancake). The eggs were also of epic proportions but the bacon was quite scarce. A measly two and a half pieces...The jumbo tossed salad was built for a king - it was brought out in the large mixing bowl that they tossed that sucker in. I asked for cheddar and dressing on the side and it was quite scrumptious."
"1.0","Came to pittsburgh for the first time and had to check out bettis' restaurant. We had a party of 13 and waited 3 hours before even getting seated. After we ordered our food it took about 45 minutes for 2 entrees to come out. The rest of us had to watch them eat. Then they told us the food was coming right out(a half hour later), they proceeded to bring only 4 more entrees out and again the rest of us were stuck sitting, watching them eat. This night turned into a disaster and as much as we love Jerome bettis this restaurant is run very poorly and we will not be returning."
"4.0","Went here for a work holiday luncheon and we had the place to ourselves.  We brought our beer and wine, but I can't confirm that it is a BYOB place, that may have just been for our private party?My office has been ordering catering for small events from Sausalido for the past two years.  I can honestly say I've never eaten anything from here that I didn't love.The food is fresh and always contains lots of healthy vegetables prepared deliciously.  Their hummus is the bomb.com.  Excellent dishes with chicken seasoned perfectly.  The staff is friendly and great.  There's nothing bad to say about Sausalido and only delicious items to enjoy."
"3.0","I wanted to like it more, I swear.  I thought the mudslide was fabulous.  Sadly, the hot and sour soup, while good, was not spicy enough.  The Mongolian beef looked nothing like Mongolian beef I have ever had.  It was good, but again, not spicy enough.  Additionally, there were no sticks to eat with, no soy sauce or mustard or chili paste on the table.  The food tasted good and was cooked well (plenty of places overcook Chinese food so this is a very good thing), but it wasn't flavorful enough.  I am willing to go back and try it again.  The people were extremely nice.  It was a slow night so the service was a little slow, but helpful and very friendly."
"5.0","Great place to grab breakfast or lunch in the Strip District. Located on Penn Ave. Food ordered and paid for at the counter and brought out to you when it is ready. Prices maybe a few dollars more than I would have expected for this type of set up but it was very good so I don't really mind that. My husband and I ate for $29.00. Not huge inside so I could imagine it would get very busy on the weekends here. Business appeared clean. Restrooms for customers in the basement. My husband had the blue cheese burger which he said was really good. Came with side of chips. The blueberry ricotta pancakes were fabulous and I highly recommend them to anyone who likes pancakes! The omelette was also excellently made with the perfect ratio of ingredients to eggs. Looking forward to coming back and trying one of their speciality sandwiches or salads!"
"4.0","I absolutely love Panera!  I like the pick 2 that they have on the menu. I usually get a salad with soup.  I would recommend trying out the steak and blue cheese salad.  I'm not a fan of blue cheese, so I ask them for feta cheese instead.  The cream of chicken and wild rice is really good too!  I have yet to try the broth bowls, but if you go on their website and watch about 2 videos that are 2 minutes in length then you get $5.00 off of the broth bowl!  Hopefully, it's still on the website!  Check it out! :)"
"4.0","Came here for brunch on Sunday. They weren't too crowded as the outdoor patio was open. The cafe has a cute and quaint vibe. I started off with coffee and my friend had the chai. Tip, if you check in on yelp, the coffee is free! I had the apple brie crepe and my friend had the berry french toast. The crepe was delicious. They did not skimp on the brie so it was nice nice and melted. The crepe was topped with apples, walnuts, syrup, and powdered sugar. The french toast was also beautifully presented with berries and chocolate sauce. The prices are very reasonable for the amount of food. They do charge automatically for mini water bottles from costco, which was a bit odd. Do want to come back to try a savory crepe!"
"1.0","*need to update Lunchtime 35 min I asked if they forgot about me no I was assured my sandwich was being made next ...still Waiting 45 min for a sandwich What's up with that? Line of about 10 people when I walked inKitchen seems staffed with 5 people My iced tea was delish as always but it took 15 minMy lunch hour totally down the drainNo apology"
"5.0","We found Sausalido thanks to restaurant week and I'd definitely go back. The service and food were both amazing and I love that they have NO TV's. It's nice to find a little place concentrated on the dining.BYOB, street parking, and be aware that they're not open some week nights - if you reserve through Open Table you should be okay."
"5.0","Tamarind is great for Indian food! Their lunch buffets are relatively cheap and with a great variety of food. Although the place is known for their South Indian dosas, I love their mutton biriyani and butter chicken! You can ask them to adjust the spice level of the food as per your need. And the ambiance is good too - they play really classic south Indian songs on a low volume inside the restaurant."
"1.0","By far the most mediocre pizza I've ever had. Not worth the calories. Crust was flavorless and had a dry, stale texture. Sauce was cheap jar quality and the cheese was bland. I would have done better heating up a grocery store frozen pizza."
"5.0","Amazing food. Amazing people. Finally found some good Mexican food in Pittsburgh."
"5.0","My sister Cyndy was in town on her birthday and my kids Megan & Michael and son's girlfriend Niki surprised her by making reservations at Alexander's Italian Bistro in Bloomfield.  When we got there, our table was ready and we were immediately greeted by Michelle.  From that moment on I knew they had picked the right restaurant.  Michelle was so sweet and attentive.  She explained the menu, helped us make our selections and made us feel like we were in her own home.Michelle started by bring us our drinks and homemade bread which she replenished a second time. It was so good.  Then our meals came. Each one of us ordered something different.  Megan had Classic Chicken Parmigiano, Michael had Penne with Marinara, Meatballs & Hot Sausage, Niki had Chicken Piccata, Cyndy had Penne with Pesto Sauce & I had Angel Hair Pasta with fresh tomatoes, spinach, chicken with splash of white wine.  We all tasted everyones dishes and we couldn't find a winner.  All were so delicious.At the end of the dinner, we all grabbed our to-go bags.  Because we had cake waiting at home, Michelle gave my sister a loaf of their fabulous bread which we enjoy the next day with our coffee.So if you are looking for a great place to eat with fabulous food in a friendly environment.  Alexander's Italian Bistro is your place!"
"2.0","Fun place for drinks, but do not go if you are hungry.  Only appetizers are available.  Great beer selection and the roof top is fun.  If you are hungry, stay downstairs for the meatballs."
"3.0","This was just an average sushi restaurant from what I'm used to. The service was great and they provide you with a warm towel before serving you. I only order rolls so I did not get a feel for the whole menu. The tempura vegetables were cooked perfectly to order and had a very nice presentation to them."
"3.0","3.5 stars.  I was brought in by the claims of how large the 'RoethlisBurger' is by vendors and other shoppers in the Strip District and I had to see it in person.  Peppi's has a dive-y sort of place but in a good way.  The flat top grill is behind the counter in the front and the back of Peppi's has a couple tables and booths with Steelers paraphernalia on the walls.I wasn't too hungry so I ended up ordering 'The Phantom', which was a cheese steak with grilled mushrooms, onions, and a fried egg.  My companions got a mushroom cheese steak and the famed #7, the 'RoethlisBurger' itself.  All the sandwiches come with the basic fixin's of lettuce tomato, etc. and are a foot long.The Phantom was a little smaller than I expected, but the flavors of the ingredients in the sandwich melded together wonderfully.  My only complaint is that I would have liked a little more meat.  After some searching online, apparently all their steak subs only have a quarter pound of steak.For some reason based on the picture of the RoethlisBurger in the window outside we thought it was going to be a lot bigger.  I guess camera angles can be deceiving.  It's a mix of chopped burger and sausage with American cheese and a fried egg.Overall I would have liked it a bit more if the sandwiches were served a bit faster (some people who ordered after us got their food first) and a bit more meat.Anyways, I'm definitely going to be back to try the RoethlisBurger since now I view it as a potentially tasty sandwich as opposed to just a ridiculously impossible food challenge."
"4.0","Over the past couple years my family and I have visited the Bettis Grille several times and we always enjoyed our visits. It's a great family-friendly environment, but you get the best of both worlds because it's also a sports bar that you could enjoy on a night out with friends. It's nice to come here in the summer and sit out in the patio area with a great view of the river, but good food is ok in my book at any time of the year!The most recent time I came to the Bettis Grille was a couple weekends ago to celebrate my brother's birthday. My mom even let him get two sandwiches to celebrate his birthday, although he saved one of the two to take for lunch at work the next day. He went with the crispy chicken sandwich and a deep-fried burger, which my other brother also ordered. My mom and I both ordered appetizers to split and we chose the firecracker shrimp and the quesadilla. I've ordered the firecracker shrimp every time I've come here so far because it's that good. It's tossed in a sauce similar to a sweet chili sauce (one of my favorites) and served over shredded cabbage. There are enough shrimp to share for sure, but if you're ordering this appetizer as your entrée, it's the perfect size.Our food arrived after a decent wait, but it was definitely a busy night as it was the Saturday after Thanksgiving. I can imagine no one wanted to cook after preparing Thanksgiving dinner. My brothers ate their sandwiches super quickly and my mom and I shared our appetizers and enjoyed them both. The deep-fried burgers really are a sight to see, because that's an item you won't find on a typical restaurant menu. Just when we thought we were stuffed and we were waiting on our check, the waitress brought out a huge plate of brownies and ice cream because she heard my mom mention my brother celebrating his birthday. This was such a nice way to end our visit and definitely made me like the Bettis Grille even more than I already did! The brownie was big enough for all of us to share, and we gave it our best shot after already eating our meals and being pretty full. I guess you're never too full for a good dessert, though.If you're out and about on the North Shore, the Bettis Grille is a great place for family dining or just a good bite to eat! It's priced standard for a restaurant in the city, so expect to pay a little more than you may anticipate for some items on the menu. Overall, I've enjoyed this place every time I've come here and I'm sure I'll be back again before too long."
"5.0","This is my favorite seafood spot in Pittsburgh. Reasonably priced, great service, and the food is SO good. I have yet to go to a seafood restaurant in Pittsburgh that beats the pricing and quality!"

"1.0","We used to go there all the time then we went there Saturday. Very disappointing the salad took over 45 minutes  no wings everything is hot and the service sucked the waiter didn't know what went with what he had to keep asking others...very disappointed and we won't be back Jerome  needs to check on this business it's going down."
"5.0","A Pittsburgh institution! Delicious breakfast, fabulous service, a must do! If there's a wait-trust me it's so worth it! Go for the chocolate chip banana pancakes."
"5.0","I have been to The Summit a few times, always for the trivia night.  A few times it has been crowded, but seats eventually open up.  The drink menu provides a lot of choices for both beer and cocktails.  There are specialty cocktails that change fairly frequently.Pretty much everything that I have ordered has been delicious.  The burger comes out juicy and perfectly cooked.  Interestingly enough, my favorite thing is the popcorn!  It is soooo good.  The browned butter is my favorite.The Name that Tune trivia is a lot of fun too.  The food, drinks and atmosphere will definitely bring me back again."
"3.0","Bring back the original korma recipe! I've been eating here faithfully since 2011. I always order the shrimp korma and over the course of the last few months, maybe year, it has completely changed. The korma sauce is a different color (used be more orange and now it's brown), it has chunks of veggies in it (it was a thick but chunkless sauce before), the spices are different and way too strong. It seriously tastes nothing like the original that has kept me coming back for more (monthly, sometimes weekly!) for 8 years. This was my go-to take out spot and the only Indian in our city that I'd eat. Help!"
"1.0","I was here for the Thursday night football game with the steelers and ravens.  First I waited about 15 minutes to get someone to even come and greet me at my table.  After that I ordered and had onion rings.  Let's just say burger king puts more effort into their onion rings.Then came the burger with with which I was impressed with till I took a bite and burnt.  It was medium well in the middle as I reauested and burnt on top mot acceptable.  I saw my server a total of 3 times never asked how the food was and didn't see any managers.  Save your money and eat somewhere else or I guess come on a better night.  I'll never be back again and it was my first time here.  Finally I'm here to watch the steelers game why would you give me the check as I planned to stay here the whole game and drink.  Poor service!!!"
"1.0","I ordered dinner Sunday evening for delivery and was very upset with the service. They said the food could take an hour (which sounded like a lot, because I live on the North Shore and they're downtown). I called after an hour when the food still hadn't arrived and I was hung up on. I called 20 minutes after, to see if I needed to cancel my order and the server guessed the food went out. About 2 minutes later I got a text that read only 'Food'. I thought maybe there was a language barrier, but when I met the delivery service, the man was clearly a native speaker. I'm shocked at how bad the service was, and that no apology was offered for my wasted evening. The food ended up being good, so dining in may be an option, but I would never order delivery."
"5.0","Delicious home cooking that tastes like your Italian Nonna's. I recently discovered Merante's while walking through Bloomfield during lunchtime. At first I thought the store was just gifts, but the delicious smells drew me inside. The back of the store is a full-blown kitchen stocked with any number of delicious delicacies. My personal favorites include: sausage stuffed peppers, ribs and liver and onions (yeah yeah I know...). The prices are reasonable and the portions are HUGE. I should also mention that the staff incredibly kind. Merante's food is made obviously made with love."
"2.0","I will preface this review by saying that I have only had the buffet here, but I have had it several times.  If you are accustomed to good Indian food, I would definitely not go out of my way to eat here.  This place survives off the hospital/academic crowd in Oakland - it is directly across the street from UPMC Presbyterian Hospital.  Their price for the buffet is pretty reasonable, but I have seen less than fresh items on their salad bar, especially the peppers.  Most of the offerings on their buffet table are standard fare, just slightly below average in taste and quality though."
"5.0","Great atmosphere, excellent service, & fantastic food! I wanted to try out a local Italian restaurant for my birthday and I couldn't have made a better choice. Being vegan, I normally do not go to many Italian restaurants because there are not many options. Alexander's has a pastabilities section on their menu that is perfect for any picky eaters or people with food allergies (they also have gluten free pasta!). I ended up ordering the malfalda Madison without feta and added broccoli to it. It was to die for! The perfect Mediterranean primavera that I was craving. Because everything is homemade, basically everything on the menu is customizable and my waitress was extremely nice about it. The portion was overwhelming for the price, I had lots of leftovers to take home. I ended my meal with espresso and they even gave me a loaf of bread to take home! I could not be more pleased with this restaurant. The owner and manager were both there, wished me a happy birthday, and could not be more kind. I will most definitely return to this little gem on Liberty ave!"
"4.0","Very good experience at this Italian Bistro. I had the Italian Chicken Salad with Hot Peppers and it was incredible. My date had the Pesto Walnut Salmon and that was superb as well.Lots of Italian Bread was served and the drink prices are reasonable.Highly recommend this place. Nice atmosphere and good service too."
"4.0","This is better than 4 stars but not quite 5.Many choices on the menu combined with generous portions and different flavors and reasonable prices make this a great everyday meal. This place is small and somewhat unkempt, so we go there for there for the food not the atmosphere.The Japanese eggplant stir fry with either duck or tofu is my favorite, but everything I have tasted is fine.BYOB"
"1.0","Okay, so I've heard a lot of good things about this place. And I wanted to like it!But it was seriously bad. I very rarely eat somewhere and don't finish my food simply because I don't like it. But I couldn't eat it. I got the Shadyside and it was super greasy, and the flavor just wasn't there. My roommate got the Portabella and she wasn't feelin' it either.The guy who served us was cool beans though."
"5.0","For me, this is one of those places where I want go around to each table and ask randos if I can taste their dinner, just so I can try everything! It's delish, it's super affordable, it's quiet (and you all know how I love quiet), and the staff are so wonderful.The BF and I have been going her for years. Why I haven't written a review is beyond me, but we went for dinner and I thought...I really have to share this place. The food is absolutely phenomenal, and I mean PHENOMENAL. I have never had anything here that didn't make me want to run in the kitchen and start licking the pots and pans. As a rule, I usually get the Pad Thai, because, well, it's Pad Thai, possibly the best dish on the planet. But I have tried other things here, and if you like different curries, this is place to get brave. The pumpkin curry is so out-of-this-world. Pumpkin Curry! Yeah. I never thought I'd say that about a pumpkin curry, but it's true! It's now one of my favorite dishes. The stir fries -i.e. eggplant basil, basil leaves- are both awesome as well. We've tried almost all the apps and sometimes I dream about going and just ordering all the apps. Well, maybe two orders of fish cakes. Yeah, fish cakes! The old me would have never even tasted something called a fish cake, but here I am, salivating at the thought of them. This place has truly changed my idea of what delicious is."
"5.0","Best burgers in town, not to expensive and have good selection of craft beers. You get two burgers n fries for under 15 bucks add craft beer and you get it all for around 20 bucks. You can smoke here too."
"5.0","we have only gotten take-out here, but we always get the pad thai (amazing) and the red curry (so great).  and fast!  give them a ring then leave the house (2 miles) to pick it up.  always ready and hot."
"4.0","prince of India is your typical Indian restaurant with a wide arrange of options. I've personally never been inside but I've always ordered for delivery. It seems like it always takes about 15 minutes for me to order over the phone but it's definitely well worth it.Portions are huge when you order for delivery so you will definitely have something to look forward to when it comes to left overs. My go to when it comes to Indian food is the vegetable Korma. They do a pretty solid Korma but it's definitely not as good as taste of India in Bloomfield. Either way if your looking for Indian and want delivery call prince of India :)"
"4.0","Burgh'ers is a winner for a casual meal in Lawrenceville. The highlights include friendly service, a menu with a wide variety of craft burgers, and specialty cocktails featuring spirits from Pennsylvania. I enjoyed the Mexican War burger. I really liked that the keto-friendly option of serving the burger on a romain wrap was right on the the menu - no special request necessary. There's also a vegetarian option. Very accommodating. The side salad with bleu cheese dressing was good too. On the Friday night I visited there was no wait for a two-top. There's plenty of room for small groups. I recommend Burgh'ers and I'll go back."
"4.0","I've visited this place 3 times,  And I've enjoy everything, every time. Our food was hot and delicious, specially they're caramel latte..omg so good! !The server was awesome.  Can't wait to come back!"
"3.0","Since Eat N Park has gone through their major remodels, I've found myself stopping into the various locations around the area. Our go to has usually been the Dormont ENP, but if the parking lot is full, we know of a few alternate spots, and Banksville is usually the other option. My daughter, and I (sound familiar?!) have begun making Saturday morning brunch our time to catch up, and eat of course. We found a parking spot without any trouble, and didn't have to wait more than five minutes to be seated. The new building seems to have brightened things up, and the food was good. My daughter wasn't able to order her usual Caramel Mocha joka drink she likes, the machine was down according to the waitress. We both ordered the Super Griddle Smiles, hers with Banana Foster French Toast, and mine with the Smiley Waffle, yum! Our food was good, nothing came out greasy, plates were clean, and the food cooked well. The only no biggie issue was my daughter had to wait for her order of potato pancakes, and my order for potato pancakes somehow turned into home fries. I'm not one to freak out over a minor slip like this, but having worked in the industry, the ticket should've been checked, and the plates should've been checked before being served. Attention to detail, that's all.Overall, I'm happy to see the remodels of the Eat N Parks, and don't mind stopping in for breakfast with family, and friends."
"3.0","3.5 stars. Competent pizza shop food at pretty reasonable prices.The pizza itself is based on a doughy, bready, soft crust complimented by tangy, herby pizza sauce. The cheese is salty and the good kind of rubbery. It reminds me of Little Caesar's almost, but with decidedly better ingredients. It's a big improvement from nearby Antoon's or Sorrento's. Any fare based off these ingredients works well. In particular, their cheesy breadsticks are absolutely delicious and are my go-to option when in the mood for carb laden food.The other stuff on the menu, such as hoagies, wings, and sides, is done pretty decently. Their buffalo sauce in particular isn't strictly a buffalo sauce, but it's tangy, spicy, and bold. As such, their buffalo chicken hoagie is one of my favorites in Oakland. Additionally, both their standard variety fries and buffalo fries are crispy, well-seasoned, and flavorful. Killer student specials cut prices significantly, so Romano isn't too tough on the wallet.This isn't destination eating, but if you're nearby it's worth a try."
"5.0","I wanted to give an update. I had a hold on my card for about $23.27 from when I dined there with my fiancé & his boss with her boyfriend on 5/30/14. Hold remained for over a week. I called & initially spoke to a manager & after a week passed called again but this time I spoke to the general manager. The GM was a really nice man, he was to the point & quick to fix the problem. The hold was removed shortly after we spoke.I can that the GM was not only polite but very apologic & was very quick to fix the problem. My fiancé & I enjoy this place & was really glad that they took care of the issue efficiently/effectively. We'll be back again soon. *Beware of those tasty moscow mules! lol*"
"5.0","You can try to resist but the smell of the delicious beef will drag you to this truck. It is the best bulgogi I a have ever had. The flavor is so intense that my eyes rolled back in my head. not too spicy but a little heat. Its just really really good food. the Bulgogi is the star but combined with the rice, kimchi and dumplings it was heaven.  You will not be disappointed. If this truck is an option make it your choice."

"4.0","Went for a lunch buffet.This will be the only Indian buffet I will ever go to. ever. again. The place is so homey and comfortable, like an Indian auntie's humble abode.  I was taken by the layout immediately. Then the food.It's a pretty large buffet for an Indian buffet and the food was amazing, even my Indian friend begrudgingly noted it's superior quality. Everything there was amazing, even for vegetarians! It was a little lacking in the Indian sweets though...I would try everything, except the salad. Why would you go to a buffet for a salad?"
"1.0","Well, we were ready to just hang out and have a few drinks.  Bar was full so we stood next to a table that had one chair.  A very rude young lady with long blonde hair informed us this was 'her' table.  Ok, we will be ordering more drinks!  Then, the hostess comes by placing a sign 'please see hostess for availability'.  Ok, I guess we were too close to the table for the waitresses liking!! She could have said 'Hello!  If you all need another drink, I can take care of you!' But no, a quick admonishment and the 'sign'!  Needless to say, we did not want to stand right in the middle of the traffic flow so we left.  Had a great time down the street;  Sharp Edge.  Spent a lot of money on food and beverages.  We are also great tippers.  Too bad blondie!!"
"4.0","Very beautiful environment and delicious food! They give you amazing ginger type cookies with the check as well. Nice servers. Very good experience!"
"2.0","Overpriced for an average Japanese restaurant. Service was ok. We regretted the choice and left hungry. The tempura was soggy and had more onions than anything. Our temakis (hand rolls) were 'mushy'. Make sure you love tobiko, because they are everywhere..."
"2.0","Horrible.  Why Food and Wine would give them a good rating is beyond me.  Pizza was dry with very little sauce.  Dough was dry and tasteless.  Very pricey to match.  Goes to show that if you pay for a good rating you get it with nothing to back it up.  Would not go back."
"3.0","I thought they had a pretty creative iced tea selection. I liked the ambiance, and the sandwich I ate was pretty good. I feel like as a first time customer, for not a very busy time of day, I wasn't given the best customer service. I was confused as to which line to be in and what was coming to my seat and what I had to get at the calendar. Nobody was really helping and when I asked I kind of got a snippy comment in regards to not being at my table or something and then i ended up standing and waiting for a good few minutes, meanwhile I'm trying to juggle my three year old. so I left still not understanding a simple pick up food concept. I'll try it again there because I did like the options but I hope for friendlier staff next time."
"5.0","My husband and I shop in the strip district a lot. This is our absolute favorite stop. Everyone is always so friendly, Kevin is always there is is always friendly and so helpful!! This is a must stop for anyone who LOVES a good Bloody Mary it's delicious you have to add the bacon and shrimp to make it complete! The food is always great, consistently great no matter what we get. We went in during restaurant week and had the best fish tacos. Today we stopped in and had the she crab soup and oysters. They know seafood!!!"
"4.0","Burgers are great staff very friendly so recommend it if you're in town here on vacation ate at a couple places this was the best"
"5.0","Well, I was warned. I like very spicy things from time to time so when I heard this place had Pittsburgh's spiciest sandwich, I had to give it a try. I got the damn hot (spiciest level) sandwich and a hot one for comparison. The flavors on both were excellent and the hot was very good. As for the damn hot.. I'm still working my way through it right now. I'm halfway done and while it's not ghost pepper or reaper level spicy, it is VERY spicy. Prepare yourself with milk if you haven't got a tolerance for heat, and some Pepto bismol for stomach cramps. I will say definitively I haven't had a spicier sandwich but if you'relooking for good flavor go with the hot, the damn hot is more of a novelty but if that's your thing, check it out!"
"5.0","Very nice atmosphere,makes me feel like I'm in NYC.Tried the whole squid which was fantastic,not too much sauce on top that you can taste the squid flavor. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful,the sashimi was fresh."
"5.0","The best breakfast&lunch place hands down! Foods are always fresh, the staff is friendly and l can not believe their fast service! My favorite food is south omlette and it was amazing! They put in it steak, mushroom,onion and cheddar and they served it so fast and warm enough! l also eat one every two days bagels and french toastes! They have all tastes for a delicious lunch and breakfast. l do love their backyard, you should have your lunch there, you will see how amazing place it is! Perfect environment, delicious foods!"
"5.0","The bar tenders here take care of you so well, there's so much craft created in each drink. The atmosphere here is so living, whether be the numerous artwork scattered throughout the building, or the weekday special and daily board games, this bar is something above the rest. If you're looking for a bar with excellent drinks, lively vibe, and a cut above the rest, The Summit on Mt. Washington is the place to be"
"5.0","Around the side of Round Corner Cantina you will find a wooden door, go through, head up the stairs, and you will find yourself in Umamai, a bustling lounge-like Izakaya. You can sit at the bar, the sushi bar, or at a high top where you order drinks and small Japanese plates to enjoy while a DJ spins. It's quite dark in here but not too loud and we enjoyed a leisurely meal here a lot. We started with a selection of grilled skewers which were very good and then moved onto some expertly fried Shrimp Tempura (plump juicy shrimp, lightly battered, not at all greasy). Next we shared a large sashimi plate which was very generous for the price, the fish and Octopus, were good quality and weren't served too chilled (over cold sushi is one of my pet hates!), we finished our meal with a couple of Yellowtail Hand Rolls which were excellent - well sized, containing a generous portion of large chunks of Yellowtail.There's a good variety of things to choose from on the menu, there's also a section featuring Udon and Ramen, and the food and drinks are all reasonably priced. It's a good spot for a romantic dinner for two but it is equally great for a bigger group as there should be something for everyone's taste on the menu, whether they are a seasoned sushi eater or a newcomer to Japanese cuisine. Service was pretty good and you can make reservations which may be a good idea at the weekends or for larger groups. All in all, if you want a fun night out with delicious food that won't cost you the earth I'd say Umami is well worth investigating."
"3.0","I will say that the first time I tried to visit Kiku... I could not find it.  It is a nicely hidden gem that you have to be confident really is there in order to find it.  Anyway, I went here for a large group gathering ( greater than 12 of us in total).  They were able to accommodate us at a very long table.  For the most part we were left to our own devices with the server really only showing up for orders, to drop of drinks once, food delivery and check delivery.  Thankfully, that's pretty much exactly what we needed and we were all able to catch up with each other mostly uninterrupted.  It is a unique little environment that I can only describe as cute.  In terms of the food, I ordered a salmon roll and the salmon was deliciously moist with deliciously excellent rice.  I definitely had one of those moments, where I realized how bad some other sushi rice was by taking one bite of my meal at Kiku.  Overall, there are the general gluten free options afforded by most sushi/ Japanese restaurants and no contamination issues.  Call ahead and they can definitely accommodate a fairly significant party."
"2.0","My husband and I ate here a couple years ago and LOVED it. We couldn't wait to have a reason to come back to Pitts and eat here again. 12/8/18 Came in town for a concert. We made reservations for our dinner well in advance of our trip and arrived 10 mins early. We were told upon arrival that they were running about 15 minutes behind on reservations because the concert that night and the place was packed. We didn't mind having to wait 15 mins for our table, try and be easy going. however 6:30 comes around and we still are waiting for a table. I overhear my husbands name quietly being said at the host stand. I said to the hubs I think we're next. But the host picked up the ticket and heads to the bar to look for the guests. He never did ask if we were the names on the ticket. After seating whoever it was, I said oh I must have misheard them and it wasn't us. After waiting another 15 mins my husband finally goes and asked when we will be sat. He gives our name again at which time the hostess has a look of quick panic and says you're next. My husband said by the look on her face she assumed we were already sat. So someone claiming to be us got tired of waiting and took our table. So FINALLY we get sat at 7 and ordered immediately. We have less then an hour to order, eat, and get to the venue. Which we were going to walk to. Again, we were looking so forward to this delicious meal. We were told by the host stand that they were getting food out of the kitchen quickly because most were going to the concert. Okay we still have 45 mins to enjoy dinner. Our food didn't come  to our table till 7:40 we immediately asked for the bill and paid it while eating as fast as we could and had to call for a car to drive us as we had no time to walk. My husbands steak was over cooked and if we weren't in such a rush we would have sent it back. My meal I will say, was delicious but I didn't get to enjoy it. Would have chose something small from the menu if we knew the kitchen was going to take longer then we were told. We spent 2 hrs here, to spend less then 10 minutes 'enjoying' our meal. And got to spend over $200 for the joy of it. And then had to pay for a car. Loved this place the first time we came. Probably would have loved it again if all went the way we were told it would. Mostly disappointed with the lack of communication with us from the staff, the morons who took our table, and what we paid to shove food down as fast as possible."
"5.0","An amazing place to grab breakfast. Some of the best and smoothest coffee I have ever had. The breakfast sandwiches are filling but feel light on your stomach while eating. It's a great place to start your day off. Love the staff."
"4.0","Quality Chinese food and very nice atmosphere for a Chinese restaurant. Two knocks in my opinion. A little pricey and do not openly ask if you want a soft drink. They give you tea and water, which is fine and healthier, but if I'm getting Chinese then more than likely I decided to forego eating healthy.I typically get the General Tso Chicken or Shrimp Fried Rice.On a side note: Best Eggrolls in the city by far."
"5.0","Such a cute and quirky caffe! You don't find caffes' like this so often in Pittsburgh! It such a friendly atmosphere and the food is delicious! I got the berries French toast with vanilla cream . The servers Julia and eto were super nice and brought out complimentary cream puffs! 10/10 would recommend."
"5.0","God's gift to mankind.  Best little Mexican place in SS and possibly planet earth.  They also have very attractive people that work there as if it couldn't get any better."
"5.0","Great place ! We went here for the first time and were not disappointed. The wines, cocktails, birch beer and Shirley Temple were absolutely amazing. The appetizers were great and the desserts really put a big finish. I recommend the mushroom risotto and the Quattro Fromaggio pizza. Loved it!"
"3.0","3.5 starsAlways fun to have a fresh place open up.This place is clearly targeted towards college students (dance party songs, swarmed with college vibes), and they chose a prime location to put this place. The chikn spices are weird---as many people have found out, medium is usually like a upper to comfortable to spicy eaters, but hot starts to kill people and I don't even want to think about the extra hot. Other than that, sandwiches are generous with thick slices of chicken, and I'd say the bread and garnishes are a step up from chikfila."
"5.0","I've eaten here once and was quite impressed with the entrees, delicious!We started off with the Samosas, which were generic and a bit boring.  This lowered my expectations, which were then blown away by our entrees.  We had Paneer Tikka Masala and Beigan Bartha, both were amazing.  We also had Garlic Naan, which I though was above average."
"5.0","My family lives in Pittsburgh so I visit often and it is a must to go to Alexanders. The food is very authentic Italian. The atmosphere is cozy and very relaxing. This is a family run business that has been in the Bloomfield Community Forever. The food was delicious, cocktails were made like they should be very tasty with no lack of alcohol, and the service was excellent."
"5.0","I first tried Edgar's Tacos the day I returned from a trip to Chiapas, Mexico. My soul yearned for something authentic and I found it here! The ingredients are fresh and the flavors are truly Mexican.  And I could speak Spanish with the nice foks behind the counter! I go back every week and take my friends and visitors to Edgar's.  I recommend the whole menu heartily."
"1.0","Recently moved to Pittsburgh from Brooklyn, NY.  Do yourself a favor, don't even try this place.FOOD: Terrible.  The pasta was definitely double boiled/precooked.  Extra soggy on the outside and whatever on the inside.  Fiance had the penne vodka sauce or comparable, and it had an off taste, and one I can't even describe.  Maybe it was the asparagus that overpowered the sauce.  I had a regular pasta and meatball dinner.  It was more of a marinara with way too much olive oil.  I work at a hospital and the cafeteria pasta I had the day after was 100x better than the food at this place.  It was just so bad, I really have nothing good to say about it.ALCOHOL: We only had wine.  You really can't mess that up because it comes pre-bottled.  PRICE:  Way, way, way over priced for the garbage food they serve you and the dirty, old atmosphere you're eating in.  We left there, after 1 appetizer, 2 pasta dishes (1 w/ meat), and 2 glasses of wine, with a $70.00 bill.  Are you serious? ATMOSPHERE/CLEANLINESS:  Dirty.  Old.  Poor music choice for an Italian restaurant.  The owners need a make over of this entire place.  Call in Chef Ramzy.  No, really... call him.   The space has potential, but wont make it at this rate.  The carpets are so dirty, I would hate to see what the kitchen actually looks like.  If the venue can't maintain the dinning room cleanliness I would hate to see what behind the scenes looks like. SERVICE:  If it wasn't for our waiter's great personality, He did keep us laughing, and very entertained.  Punctual with our food and drinks.  Overall, good service experience.  But if it wasn't for the service, I wouldn't have even given this place 1 star.  Oh wait... we can't give lower than this."
"2.0","Even with a groupon, this place disappointed! Friendly service, attentive service but when I addressed two things - the macaroni and cheese was too salty and my daughter couldn't eat it, nothing was offered to correct the situation. When our food first arrived, there was an immediate check to see if all was good. First bite was good, then we were not checked on until the end of the meal, where the two complaints were made. My other complaint was the fried chicken, the first bite was good until I realized that all three of the pieces on my plate were dark meat. I can tolerate dark meat but I did not expect the meal to be entirely dark meat. I would have never ordered it. When I expressed my disappointment,  again no offer to remedy the situation. The three burgers that were ordered at the table were all tasty but the consensus was that they ran small for the pricing of them. The fries were delicious and plentiful. The draft beers were great. Stick to burgers and fries and if you don't mind the pricing for the patty size, you will be fine. We much prefer the 16.00 huge, multi meat cut burger at Eleven.There was plenty of loud music to be heard. I don't know if every day is 80's day but you can manage to tune out the Phil Collins and Billy Joel if you try."

"5.0","I am in love with this place! It makes me sad that I have to go all the way to Pittsburgh to get my Umami fix.Pros:- Charishi bowl was fresh and had good variety- The beef don had complex and unique flavors that just worked together- Love the skewers and a number of the appetizers - Great service- Cool environment - very unique decor Cons:- It can get busy, so plan accordingly. Strong suggest reservations.- It's a small place and has a lot of stepsI love every single bite that I have had Umami and can't wait to go back."
"5.0","Azorean Cafe is a great example of the growing food industry in Pittsburgh. This Azorean/Portuguese cafe is located right on Liberty Avenue in Bloomfield and offers a very unique menu for breakfast and lunch. You have the option to order classic American food, but there are also a lot of great meals for those daring enough to step out of their comfort zones. I decided to try a traditional Azorean lunch and ordered the Polvo Guisado, which is a baked octopus dish that resembles a sort of stew. The flavors were very foreign to me but I really enjoyed it and appreciated the quality of the food. My friends ordered omelettes for their meals and were all very content as well."
"5.0","The absolute best pancakes and potatoes I have ever had in my entire life. AMAZING!!!"
"5.0","A great place for a coffee meeting and a quick lunch. I never get interrupted by loud noise when I'm having a business meeting here. The staff is always friendly and the ambiance relaxing. I will be back to try more of the food menu that looked absolutely delicious. It's a great neighborhood establishment. The variety of teas are impressive and they're always prepared to perfection! If you're in the area, it's definitely worth the stop."
"5.0","I love Caffe Mona!!!  There food is amazing and the staff is extremely friendly and welcoming.  Their coffee and food is amazing and fresh.  This time, we ate on their back porch which is so vibrant and cute.  This is the perfect breakfast/lunch spot!  Will be coming back often :)"

"3.0","Above-average pizza, decent menu selection and good bottled beer selection for a pizza shop and quickly prepared - a little pricier than other area options. Recommend the traditional pizza over their white pizza. Gyro rolls are worth the try, as well."
"5.0","Stopped last night with my wife and some friends.  The staff was very pleasant and the manager made sure to come over to the table.  The waitress knew the beers and was able to explain it.  They had six beers on tap.  My wife and I decided to just get taster of all six.   The blithering hayseed was light and refreshing and very different.  The RAJ was unique but quite good. The IPAs were on the mark. And so was the stout.  They are very new so they do not fill growlers yet.  But can't wait to bring this beer home."
"4.0","Delicious . .. affordable charbroiled burgers! It's been such a long time since I went to Hardee's it was such a treat. They offer regular fries and curly fries too!   They offer a slider box deal for seven bucks which includes a cookie!"
"1.0","Well, it all stared when I first sat down. I didn't get waited on for about 20 minutes. It was only 11pm at night - not a prime time. When I got my silverware, I noticed it was used from the bathroom. The waitress gave me an attitude and I did not receive my food for another 30 minutes. I am very disappointed in my eat in at the park."
"3.0","I really want to love Tamarind because it is right down the street from my boyfriend's house and he LOVES Indian food, but every time I give it a chance, something offputting happens. On Valentine's Day, the kitchen made a mistake on our takeout and gave us one order of Tikka Masala instead of 2. Now, we were looking for a romantic dinner, but sharing one order isn't exactly what we had in mind. That time, the Tikka Masala was really good, but since then, we've had takeout in which the chicken was almost spongey. I found it completely inedible. I think we'll give it another chance or two because it is close and has been delicious in the past, but if we don't and I never end up eating there again, I'll really be OK. And a $5 corkage fee? Really? That's just ridiculous."
"4.0","My family discovered Alexander's while trying to find a simple-yet-classy Italian restaurant that was open on Sundays.  I didn't know what to expect but was very impressed.  We loved the atmosphere- the dining area has a very cozy feel to it.  The area is small, so the tables are close together.  The only drawback of this was that we couldn't help but overhear the conversations at neighboring tables.  I liked the menu, they had many classic dishes and also a make-to-order pasta section.  My parents have simple tastes, so this suited us very well.  All choices were reasonably priced.  I ordered penne pasta with 'marfredo' sauce- a blend of marinara and alfredo.  It was delicious, and came in a very large portion.  My mother ordered the chicken parm and she claims it was the best she's ever had.  All in all it was a good dining experience and I'm happy that we found this place."
"5.0","This place was awesome.  The breakfast pastries are amazing! I recommend the blueberry ricotta pancakes.  Service was great, very friendly."

"1.0","I really liked Cafe Raymond, until this morning. I walk in, and take a seat. I am waiting for my mentor to get to the place. They come and tell me I can't sit unless I order. So, I say, I'm waiting for my other party, but I'll take some coffee. There is literally 10 open tables in the place - only 1 being occupied - a d they tell me I have to order food in order to sit down. What?!?  So I ask, so that means I have to stand up until she gets here? They reply, 'yes.' I can't even believe that. So, I leave. To be told I have to stand when there is NO ONE in the place is ludicrous.  That'll be my last time going there."
"5.0","Caffe Mona is my number one go-to place for brunch, coffee, and casual hang-time! The owners are awesome and make every effort to ensure a perfect experience. The servers are efficient-sweet- and attentive, the cooks are hands down the BEST, and the back patio is the cherry on top of what will be the first of many delish brunches. How else will you get to try everything on the menu?!  trust me when I say, you can't go wrong with this place!"
"2.0","Another Pittsburg staple. Unfortunately, this was the one I liked the least. The staff here was super friendly especially when they found out I was a newbie. I opted for the cheesesteak and fries. The restaurant itself is small and they had good music playing. It felt kinda like a dive but it was clean enough (the bathroom was not). The fries came first and they were just alright. They desperately needed salt. The sandwich came out next and it was just okay. I've honestly had better cheesesteaks but what I absolutely loved was the bread. It was so fresh and soft. That was the best part for me and the only reason I would return."
"1.0","Out of gluten free regularly, it even at 4:00pm they won't take out more gluten free dough."

"2.0","I USED to love Little Chicago's.  When I first moved here, it was the only pizza I knew, and the only I cared to know.  The pizza is deliciously cheesy and greasy; which is perfect for a late night slice of pizza.But now that I've tried the likes of Pizza Sola and Blue Grotto; Little Chicago's doesn't seem quite as tasty. Nevertheless, I wanted a pizza delivered tonight, so I called Little Chicago's.  At 11:30, on a Thursday night.  That doesn't seem like a tall order for a pizza joint that delivers.  But the phone call I just experienced would suggest otherwise.  The girl that answered the phone seemed...perplexed.  Why...what...where....do you want a pizza delivered???  It seemed a foreign concept.  Really?   I know that every time I've been in there, the employees have been in an alternate state of being...but seriously.  So much so that you forget you're working in a delivery pizza joint!?  It was really disconcerting to call a pizza place at 11:30 on a Thursday night (a Monday night, maybe?) and catch them off guard and confused about an order as simple as 'large pepperoni, delivered'."

"3.0","Had crepes on the brain, and visited Caffe. Ordered the turkey blue and a coffee. The crepe portion was huge. But just big cuts of deli turkey and ham that you'd find on a chef salad. And the dollop of jar Dijon mustard on top didn't add anything. The side of tossed greens was sad too. The food was alright but I wouldn't go out of my way again for this. Service was fast and nice."
"2.0","pretty certain my dog can slice a bagel more evenly than this. also not sure why my cinnamon crunch bagel has a hint of onion to it"
"4.0","This place is small and cozy. We came here on a Sunday night and the restaurant was not busy. Our waitress was friendly and not pushy since we took a while trying to navigate the extensive menu options! I ordered the tortellini. The dish was rich with the ricotta cheese and the creamy sauce. I finished only about half the dish. The flavors were good but it got to be too much after a while. The portion was also huge which may also have to do with my ability to finish it. We also ordered the veal parm with pasta. The veal was cooked nicely. The meal came with 2 pieces of veal and a nice portion of pasta with marinara sauce. I liked it better than the tortellini. That dish didn't have anything left at the end of the meal! For dessert we ordered the ice cream with candied nuts and the tiramisu. Both very good! The tiramisu was not too sweet and a nice portion to end the meal."

"1.0","I was there for the first time on Saturday early evening. Waiting time was about 3 minutes for a table. The walk to the booth was somewhat tight. You have to squeeze in between tables. It wasn't long after we sat the waiter came over to get our beverage order. It did take a few minutes for the beverages including water to be served. We placed our orders nothing that wasn't on the menu. My soup arrived without a spoon. The rolled napkins only have knives and forks, I am not sure what that's all about. I had to wait several minutes for the spoon but the soup was excellent. I ordered shrimp tacos. They arrived, I tasted a shrimp it was good. I looked deeper into the taco and there was dry lettuce ( not even good lettuce) and shrimp. The description mentioned a slaw and a dressing. My three tacos were missing those items.  I questioned the waiter and after a good 7-10 20 minutes the waiter returned with the dressing. I returned the entire dish of dry shrimp tacos.  Honestly, I was not impressed and do not think I will return there."
"5.0","Wow! What an awesome find this place was! I wasn't feeling the best, and I'm quite sad that I didn't get to fully experience the summit in all its glory. I can't wait to go back and devour their food and cocktail menu.I would have never expected to find such a trendy spot in the rough-and-tough bar section in Mt. Washington. My friend and I were (rather foolishly) walking around Wednesday night hoping to grab a couple drinks. I don't typically come up here because the bar scene is just not what I'm looking for. After walking up and back Shiloh for a minute, we decided to walk into the Summit because it didn't look intimidating and it was very crowded. That had to be a good sign!The bar is gorgeous and inviting, with oak accenting throughout. The bar is set to the left and takes up a large portion of the place, but that's okay because the bar is where you want to be here. We found two seats on the end and ordered pretty basic drinks. She had a Tito's cranberry and I had a rum and sprite.I'm always weary of order specialty cocktails because I either fall in love or I'm so disgusted that I swear off alcohol for a month (hello, Roanoke in Chicago!). Everyone around us seemed to have splurged on a menu item, so next time I come in I'll certainly try it out. We didn't eat much because again, I was not feeling well. The hangover stayed way more past its not-welcomed welcome, and the old adage that you can fix a hangover with more alcohol was not working for me. We had some fries, which were super crispy and seasoned well. I couldn't hang out much longer, which saddened me to the max because I quickly fell in love with the ambiance. They were also playing music trivia. I love trivia!I can't wait to come back to Pittsburgh next so I can come back and bask in all of the Summit's glory!"
"5.0","Second time here. Came in for the #7 'Roethlisburger' and it didn't disappoint. My kids loved the environment and reading the stuff in the walls. My son recommended a sandwich and they said they might make it and name it after him. While we don't expect it, what a cool thing to do. We will definitely be back!!"
"2.0","Eatable, but far from amazing Indian food (which is however better than what one gets elsewhere in Pittsburgh - which says a lot)."
"5.0","Yelp was pushing me to order through the app, so after a quick search I came across Beta Bites, the food looked delicious and they offer options I can't find commonly (Okra!)The delivery wait was as expected from a place in the busy end of town (and big props for downtown delivery!), and the food was top notch. The Okra was delicious, the lamb panini was flavorful, and even the Mac & cheese tasted great. Def. on my go to list in the future."
"1.0","When I went to go to in with my service dog I was asked to leave or sit out side when its posted service dogs welcomeIf you have special needs don't go"
"4.0","Food was delicious and the service was prompt and pleasant.  Atmosphere has a little to be desired and though my daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed our dinner, it was a bit depressing to be the only ones in there on a Saturday night during Parents Weekend at 8:15!  Summer rolls were tasty and fresh and one order was perfect for 2 ppl. (1 each as app).  Had the basil duck as my entree and it was amazing.  The duck was tender and perfectly cooked and the level 3 spice was just enough heat.  Price was just right too.  Wish I'd checked to see that it is BYOB :("
"5.0","Great meal and almond milk latte! Smells really good the moment you walk in and great atmosphere. Thanks Chef!"
"5.0","This place is awesome, great burgers, fried chicken, appetizers...haven't had anything to complain about yet! Service is excellent! Very personable and friendly staff. All natural choices prepared to please, even the beverages."
"5.0","I've tried several sandwiches and fries and never left disappointed. The different combinations you get on a sandwich makes this place certainly uncommon and interesting. I had the hamburger, sausage and egg burger and it is amazing!"
"3.0","Terribly terribly noisy. Had a reservation for 6 people and was seated at a high top round table in the far corner that could have easily have accommodated 12.; so huge uncomfortable and impossible to hear each other bcause of the racous din and size of table all this despite there being a table for six vacant in the front of the room. Had to go and request the move. EVERYONE HAD TO. CRAWL THRU THE  DINING ROOM AS NO SPACEs BETWEEN TABLES. Long wait  for food. Then food runners brought one of our party a meal actually intended for one of the party of two next to us. (ordered the same item) so he ate while  the rest of us waited another 15 minutes. The guy at the next table also waited while his wife ate. How can you not know the difference between a table of six and a table of two? The waiter later admitted to us what had happened. I ordered grilled fish tacos and speciifcally spoke to waiter about not blackened spices. It arrived blackened. Waiter was good refilling the drinks but never checked with us about our meals. I have never in my life been in such a loud restaurant. DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE NOISE LEVEL. With tip meals for six, $300."
"4.0","I went here after an art crawl. It was beautiful outside and they had the side doors open to the air.My waiter was very helpful and knowledgeable. They gave me a water decanter on my table, but when my glass was empty they still came to the table to fill my glass.The menu changes seasonally.  I ordered ricotta gnudi appetizer. It was a rolled and stuffed cheese with apple butter and seasonal ingredients,  it was good.I also ordered the Bacon and Egg pizza with maple syrup. It tasted like breakfast! I sat by the window and people watched in the open air. Very relaxing.This is the second floor of 3 floors of Sienna Mercato."
"5.0","Such amiable and attentive owners, they gave us great service. The food is awesome as well. Definitely will come back :)"
"4.0","This place is hidden away in some corner of shadyside. The only reason I was able to discover this gem was one of my friends visiting me had a car with him.Honestly, just move to an area closer to the universities and within one-two bus stop reach. The food here is very delicious. OMG the saag panner is amazing. I ended up carrying two boxes back home with me just because I wasn't sure when I would be back here again (broke grad student life :/)"
"2.0","I reviewed it a few weeks ago but it disappears! It is not as good as I expected at all. I get used to the Nashville hot chicken (Hattie b's) with spicy & super tasty flavor. But for this place, I can only tell the 'spicy' part, there is NO savoring or tasty element. I am highly disappointed. I will not come back again. However, the decoration and the service are within good standards."
"2.0","Had oyster po boy for $18 not so great. Terrible old fries, for $18 maybe edible fries?"
"5.0","Wonderful, relaxing atmosphere. The Arnold Palmer transports me back to Carolina and the food and service are always great."
"5.0","Chicken sharmola (I think that's what it's called) is EXCELLENT. From the seasoning on the chicken to the homemade sauce. Food was hot upon arrival and the prices were what I would expect in Oakland. Wish I lived closer! I would order from them on a weekly basis!"
"5.0","Hands down the best and most exciting new restaurant in Pittsburgh.  I was able to make my first visit here this past Friday for dinner after hearing nothing but good things about it.  Celebrating a birthday party for a family friend, I was able to sample a variety of items off of the menu.  For appetizers, the calamari, mussels, and stuffed portobello mushrooms were outstanding.  Rather than being fried, the calamari was sautéed and served with a pesto sauce along with other vegetables.  The mussels were cooked to perfection in a tomato based broth, and I must admit that they were by far better than Point Brugge Cafe's signature dish.  The mushrooms were stuffed with quinoa and paired with cherry tomatoes that provided excellent contrasts in both taste and texture to the meaty mushrooms.  For main courses, I was lucky enough to taste the ricotta gnocchi with lamb ragout, the daily risotto with chicken and other vegetables, along with the seared scallops.  Of all the risotto was the most outstanding, but all of the dishes were equally tasty.  It was very hard selecting an entrée since all sounded delicious.  Desert was equally amazing with tastings of a macadamia nut bread pudding and an apple cider creme brulee.  Sausilido is easily one of the best places in the city offering innovative cuisine at reasonable prices.  I will be looking forward to many more excellent meals here."
"4.0","It's A Bar next to the ballparks Yep it smells like tap beer in the carpet. Hey That's ok, that's what a SPORTS BAR with GREAT WINGS is suppose to be! Long Straight bar plenty of TV's.OK NOW TO THE WINGS... CRISP ON THE OUTSIDE hot in the middle and not over cooked Jerky wings. I had them dusted in JERK so the allspice rings out, not spicy so I asked for a side of GREAT BALLS OF FIRE dipping sauce. Yep just another whacked out name for some not to hot east coast crap? BAM I was so exited when this orange sticky super sauce packed a PUNCH.... YEP ME EATIN my words FINALLY a wing sauce worth eating in the BURGH! Hats off RED literally all I had to take my hat off to wipe the sweat. HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY. Swing on in grab a seat eat some wings'! TIP ALL YOU CAN EAT WINGS WEDNESDAY 9.99"
"4.0","The pizza here is amazing and the slices are huge!! I also really love their garlic dipping sauce. The only problem with this place is they could do some work on the inside of the shop, it's kind of dark inside and the only place to sit are two big wooden benches with a wooden coffee table in the middle so if you want to eat there it's not the easiest thing to do. The owner did hurry out and bring us plates, silverware, and napkins though when he saw us struggling with two toddlers who were overly hungry and exhausted so that was really nice of him. The quality of the food and the prices can't be beat I wish I lived closer because this would definitely be my go to pizza shop."
"4.0","My first impression when walking in the door was 'whoa, this is dangerous and confusing.' The narrow stairway was dimly lit by red lighting, walls were black, and you have to walk up two flights of stairs before reaching the restaurant. Might not be a good place to go to after a few drinks, haha! Despite blindly hiking up the stairs, I loved the look of the place. We tried some robatayaki (skewers), temaki (handroll), and takoyaki (squid fritters). Of these dishes, I recommend the temaki the most. These small handrolls were quite simple, but the 'injection' of the house-made soy sauce was delicious and bursting with umami flavor. The food concept here is small bites of Japanese street food. Prices seem reasonable until the bites are served, as they are literally bite-sized. Expect to spend a good amount of money if you're looking to leave with a full stomach. This concept seems to be on the rise with hip restaurants these days, but I think it's a nice way to sample the menu."
"4.0","We stopped in here a couple times while we were in town to get some work done, grab a snack, and have a coffee or smoothie. Both the mango and berry low fat smoothies were fantastic and the coffee was good as well. Great scones too (we liked the blue berry and the orange best). The place has free wifi and tons of seating, so I can see why it was packed with students. The facilities could have been a bit cleaner (both the tables and restrooms needed a good clean) so I will take off one star for that, but I get that its tough with so many students in and out."
"4.0","I decided to try this local brewpub as we were in the mood for burgers and some draft beer. The draft list was relatively strong and varied. I decided to go with a black IPA that I found smooth and tasty. I should have ordered a flight to get a wider range of options available. Maybe next time. For my meal I ordered the Mexican War Burger as I generally order the spiciest thing in the menu. The burger was flavorful and had a nice kick. The service was good and the general ambiance is casual. I would definitely return and recommend for informal meals with groups."
"5.0","My favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Incredible Italian meals and desserts. Very friendly staff and lots of gluten-free options! I love the create-your-own pasta. I usually get the gluten-free pasta with peas, hot Italian sausage and the gorgonzola (I think) cream sauce. The walnut ball for dessert is incredible too."
"2.0","I live in coraopolis I was in the mood for some pizza so I took a drive to south side  ? There was a pizza place by PNC bank that I remember when  my going out days, but the pizza place change to Gennaro's so I saw on the wall how they have all these rewards so they must have good pizza i was like YES!!! Then man was I WRONG? big disappoint!  I must say for being a pizza place won these awards they must be the shit!!! So I didn't wait till I got home out of all fairness I had  to try it before I leave the parking lot. So 1 slice then 2  slice then by the time I got to the 3rd slice i was like REALLY??  This is what they were known for best pizza??? The sauce is to sweet for my taste bud and the dough had some sweet taste as well? I couldn't really taste the cheese to get the combination from the dough or the sauce,  big disappointment coming from these readers choice rewards good luck Gennaro's"
"2.0","I've been wanting to try this place for a while. I finally convinced my husband to go and I have to say I was let down. I got the grilled chicken sandwich and he got a burger. The food was ok but not worth it for the price. Beer selection was limited. I did like the plates the food was served on! However, we left there disappointed. About seven hours later I woke up violently I'll and was sick the rest of the evening. Needless to say but we won't be going back."
"4.0","Very cute spot! The photos put off a different vibe than the actual restaurant but that is okay! I am a little confused/out off because they used plastic water bottles. Is there something wrong with tap? Other than that the food was good! Service was alright as well."
"3.0","I went here for Pittsburgh Restaurant Week for the lunch menu which was around $20 for an appetizer, entree, and dessert. I was expecting a lot more from a place that I had heard so much about. It wasn't too busy in the restaurant, but the service seemed a bit overwhelmed. My appetizer (crab roll) came out after my entree (crab tacos) and I was already about halfway through my tacos when it came out, so I ended up taking it home for dinner. That being said, the spicy crab roll was probably my favorite part of the meal - the sushi seemed fresh and it was very flavorful. The tacos were a bit mediocre. The tempura-battered crab carried the dish, as nothing else really had any flavor. It definitely could have used a little sauce or seasoning, and it was incredibly difficult to pick up and eat since each taco just had a giant hunk of crab. We then waited quite a while just twiddling our thumbs for our desserts. The mango cheesecake was delicious and plated beautifully, but again - nothing to rave about. My other friends got the bread pudding and the chocolate cake and weren't impressed by either. All in all, not terrible for $20. However, not one of my favorite places to eat."
"5.0","My husband and I came in for dinner before the theatre. Our server Fonz was amazing! He treated us like the most important table in the room. We started off with the Tuna Tartare appetizer and BURRATA WITH HEIRLOOM TOMATOES salad. Both portions are large so we were able to share. Both of our steaks were cooked perfectly. It was a perfectly romantic evening."
"2.0","Not worth the price tag. Pizza showed up burnt and tasted like it had been sitting out all day."
"5.0","I was able to catch this food truck outside of Leaning Cask Brewery.  I was intrigued by the truck and wasn't sure what to expect. They were super friendly, the food was awesome, and it was super quick.  I wasn't sure about getting thw lwttuce and green onions on my rice and meat bowl. I got the beef and spicy pork. It was fantastic. The fried dumplings are out of this world good. Definitely get an extra order. I am so happy with the friendly smiles and service I recieved. They were fast and efficient and friendly. I will definitely go back. One of the best food trucks in PA."
"4.0","This gem is pretty close to work so i was able to check it out for lunch with a couple of my work mates. There were 6 people in my party and they were able to seat us immediately ...it was also 1230pm.   The place is small and intimate. Cute decor and very homey.  They have a simple no fuss italian menu.  Appetizers, sandwiches and bigger meals. Its BYOB. They had one vegetarian salad, one vegetarian wrap and entree. Our waiter was a bit dull and even maybe hangover?? very blah demeanor.  He also wasn't familiar with some of the items on the menu. i.e the salad of the day. However this was quickly redeemed by their white bean/olive oil vinaigrette dip that comes with the basket of bread. OMG delish i probably ate too much. It had the perfect kick and a great way to get the tummy ready for the entree.  I ordered the  lemon goat cheese ravioli with asparagus and it was delicious. A bit more cheesier than i expected but still extremely flavourful the asparagus was probably my favourite item on the plate. Fresh and not too raw or over cooked. The serving was big and i got to have some leftovers for dinner.One of  My meat eating friends got the chicken sandwich that shes still talking about. My glass of water was refilled frequently and so was my friends' ice teas. We also got our checks pretty quickly.  A+ for the fast service. Other than the lack of enthusiasm for life from our waiter, I thought this place was great. The lunch prices are also very reasonable. $11 for my ravioli and about 9/10 for sandwiches. At the end of the meal the chef came out to see how we liked our meals and he was cute and friendly thus adding one more star to this review. If you work in Bloomfield or shadyside this is a great place to check out for lunch. We were there for about 45 minutes and with the fast service you will be able to enjoy an amazing meal without getting on the boss's shit list."
"2.0","Received a two star because the food was excellent, but host staff is horrible.  Was visiting from out of town and thought it would be nice to visit the north shore for the Game since I've never been there before.  I have been in the food serviceIndustry and have never seen such poorly trained Manager or Host staff. Went there on game day and put my name on the list.  After waiting for 1.5hrs I asked hostess where my name was on the list and they said they called my cell phone and i didn't answer.  I showed the hostess my cell phone log and showed her that I had NOT missed any calls, and NO calls from any numbers in PGH.  She insisted she called me and there was nothing more she could do.  There was a guy standing there and I asked him if I could talk to a manager and he said he would get one.  He left and returned and said there weren't any managers present and he couldn't find one.  BTW, while I was standing there a girl came up and said she had two missed call and showed them her phone log and they told her we gave your table away for not answering.    I asked the gentleman his name and he refused to give it to me, and said I was out of luck on getting a seat.  I asked for the manager again and voices started to elevate and he asked me to step outside so we could settle it the  old fashioned way with a fight...  Now I'm asking him, are you really threatening me because you don't want to find your manager???   Fortunately there was a patron behind me who heard the whole thing, asked if I needed a manager and left and returned in less than a minute with one.   The manager did not seem concerned that her server just threatened me and wanted to go outside, nor did she seem concerned over how the other hostesses said they called me when I didn't have any missed calls and perfectly good cell signal.  Her only comment to me was it was game day and it happens.   I have worked major Events my whole life and know the planning associated with it and can relate, but again making this statement is not fixing the problem or addressing the issue with the staff.   Fortunately as we were going through these issues another gentleman walked by and said I have your seat follow me.   Not sure why the manager or all the other staff are so poorly trained.   If They are going to use cell phones as the only source to commiunicate a seating they need to be prepared to address issues when they are wrong and accidentally cross a name offThe list without contacting them.The waiter we had was excellent and food was excellent, but this incident soured the whole experience"
"3.0","I'm gonna put it right out there.  The best Pad Thai I've ever had is at Spice Island in Oakland.  So whenever I go to a Thai restaurant, I have to compare it!  Please don't give me a hard time for ordering Pad Thai at every Thai place I go:)  IF I end up going somewhere twice, I promise I'll order something different...(kinda promise, okay?).So...I ordered the Pad Thai.  It was okay, but nothing special.  I prefer my Pad Thai to have a rich peanut sauce and the sauce was pretty sparse on this one.  It did have plenty of sprouts, which is a plus for me though!  I also liked that the meal included soup (wonton or lemongrass) and an egg roll.  Love the extra perks!Service was nice and quick with the total bill around $10 for everything, including the Jasmine tea I ordered.  I like a cheap meal, I just want a little more sauce!"
"2.0","I've been here before and the food was good, overpriced but good. Today, however, I sat down for breakfast that I was really looking forward to but was left completely unsatisfied. I ordered an omelette and it was bland. No salt or seasoning, bad texture, the side salad was very sad. The only redeeming component was the coffee. The service was poor as well. The 'server' seemed irritated the whole time. I will not be returning."
"5.0","Such a cute place in Bloomfield. The back patio had  colorful umbrellas hanging from the ceiling  that looked amazing with the sun coming in! The food was really tasty would 10/10 come back. The staff was kind and helpful!"
"2.0","Twin lobster tails: extremely overcooked and tasteless. Was going to get whole main lobster and waiter suggested these were much better. I think they just had overstocked trying to get rid of :-(. Very slow service. Told waiter at the start we had to leave by 6:15 yet he dragged his feet getting one piece of cheese cake in the end waiting almost ten minutes for it. I won't eat at this location again.On the plus side they have the best bread basket anywhere.I must say the restaurant did call and offer to make it right so you can't really ask for any more then that. No ones perfect all the time."
"4.0","Visiting Pittsburgh for the first time, Yelp pointed us in the right direction towards Pamela's for breakfast.It passed the 'parking lot' or rather waiting room test and was packed to the the brim on Saturday at 11am... Perfect, this means we are at the right place for a good breakfast. Only a short wait later we were seated comfortably at a table.Great signage to say that they were a 'CASH ONLY' establishment. Thanks for not making it awkward at the end....Overall the food was excellent. I had a Hotcake with Walnuts and Bananas... I wished it came with some sort of side because I was still hungry afwards.  My friend had a omelet with home fries which she said was delicious as well.It wasn't life changing and innovative, but the food was excellent for a brunch location in Pittsburgh. Loved Walnut street as well. Beautiful location for a breakfast spot.Parking wasn't so bad either! See you next time Pamela's!"
"5.0","Great beer. I had a lager and was really pleased. The beer tasted like an authentic German lager. On the food front, it was bananas. Pierogi, Scotch egg, haluski, and schnitzel sandwich were all great. The schnitzel had an egg on top that was unnecessary (mayo would have filled in the fat aspect), the only let down was the Buffalo chicken rillettes because there wasn't enough spice and the bleu cheese overwhelmed everything else. The star of that dish was definitely the pickled celery."
"5.0","They make great vegetarian Thai food - they do tofu right!"
"4.0","Great casual neighborhood Indian restaurant. I've come here semi-regularly over the past few months and have never left unsatisfied. First the place- the restaurant is in a Victorian style house, and is warmly decorated with nice paintings on the wall. It is nothing fancy, very casual, but it feels very welcoming. Easy to have a long relaxed lunch or dinner here.The food - solid Indian food. No bells or whistles, just solid cooking. The food feels like authentic home cooking. Very reasonably priced. The chicken tikka masala is always good, and I have a soft spot in my heart for their vegetarian dishes with okra and eggplant.The service - very friendly! Prompt and courteous.Tip- Come by for the lunch buffet! For just $9.23 (incl tax) on weekdays and around $11 on weekends. It's all you can eat, (including mango lassi! *drool*) and has a wide variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. Good option for serving larger groups too."
"5.0","Dare I say best fresh seafood in town?! Lobster was full of flavor-tender, the crab salad was Baltimore worthy. Fresh food cooked well. The friendly wait staff was icing on the cake."
"4.0","I'm really won over by this whole group. I love Mercato aka meatball heaven. I love the rooftop deck and I now love Mezzo. Their specialty is wood fired pizza's and wine. Definitely speaking my language.I was very excited about the pizza's we choose. I was most surprised to like the Sausage & Smoked Potato pizza the best. It was tomato, smoked mozzarella, basil, and of course potato. I loved the smokey flavor! I also liked the Picante Salami & Peppers. It was tomato, mozzarella, chili, pickled banana peppers. I love me some banana peppers on a pizza, and pickled ones, YUM. The Margherita, with tomato, mozzarella, basil was good. Of course it's the most basic of all of them, but still good. I love the aesthetic too. Definitely more chill up here than the other two spots. I'd be interested to check out their pasta dishes next. Let's be honest, I'm interested in checking out all dishes here!"
"5.0","I am super picky about my cocktails but The Summit satisfies every time. This small, dark bar consistently makes the best hand crafted cocktails in Pittsburgh. Mo is the best server and Jay is great behind the bar. The food menu is small but the kitchen staff always on point, I am never disappointed. Between the cocktails, food, and service, there is nothing to complain about at The Summit."
"5.0","The menu was wonderful. It looks so exquisite it was hard to decide between the chicken sandwich, the burger or the mac n cheese. We had all 3!! We were not disappointed. You won't be either."
"4.0","i wouldn't describe the service here as 'bad' necessarily, kind of just...weird? i get the impression that the servers i often have are maybe just young and without a lot of restaurant experience? the service in my experience isn't typically rude, just on the slow/overwhelmed side and seem kind of nervous to be honest! but i will say, don't expect to be 'in and out' here, even for takeout. i spend about an hour in here to eat and i see people waiting on the couch in the front for a few minutes for their takeout orders to be ready. not outrageously slow, but definitely not speedy. for vegans: i honestly recommend dinner over the lunch buffet, as in my experience the bulk of the buffet is not vegan (vegan stuff is usually just variants on lentils and beans, not really anything that would count as a main course) and doesn't seem to rotate much. for a few dollars more you can get a big platter of whatever you want plus the included sides which are also typically vegan! the dinner plate of  baingan bharta is INCREDIBLE--i would eat this multiple times a week if i could!"
"2.0","Tacos are still delicious but service has been horrible the last few months. The cooks are good but there's one cashier who is just awful... rude, rushes you despite there being no line, impatient and overall just seems annoyed the whole timeI have recommended this place to countless people. Not to mention brought my friends here from out of town.. I've brought my family here from out of state the girl's horrible attitude totally ruined it for all of them."
"4.0","I love eating at Kiku, I've tried their Sushi about 15 times and I have never been disappointed. They have the best Miso Soup in the city.  The atmosphere is elegant and the service is always excellent. Watch for their specials, they have an 'all you can eat' night that is a good deal."
"4.0","Out of 5:3.0 - Grilled Strip Steak: Fresh bread and greens.  Steak was a tad overcooked, but still good.3.5 - Farfalle with almonds: Great mix of flavors and textures.2.0 - Service: a bit slow, forgot some details about my order."
"1.0","Wow...this place. You'd think the man who invented splitting up checks was Einstein once you meet these people!!!

Oh yeah, the volume on the jukebox is weaksauce too"
"5.0","Just went to Alexanders Italian Bistro , Boy What a Treat ! There should be another Star for this place. The Food was excellent , the wine was very good and the deserts were to die for. Ok maybe I might have had a little too much wine.,But I was very impressed. The staff was very attentive , The Italian bread was fresh and plentiful, And I had the Angel hair spaghetti with Hot peppers and hot sausage. My friends had  seafood  selections. Espresso for everyone after the Tiramisu Deserts ! YUMMMMM !I would Recommend Alexanders to anyone who enjoys fine Italian food. ( PS its not a chain restaurant )Parking was plentiful too. I LOVE Mom& Pop places. Very clean & cozy.More Wine Please ?"
"5.0","Awesome pizza for $5 for a large cheese (fresh dough and a decent amount of cheese) ... So much better than little caesars $5!!!!"
"4.0","When I'm craving Indian food and want to eat nonstop, I come here. I've only had the lunch and dinner buffet. While you're filling your first plate, they will give you a basket of freshly baked naan. The buffet isn't as big as other restaurants around the Pittsburgh area, but they do have the standard Indian buffet fare (tikka masala, tandoori chicken, paneer, etc.). Wash it down with Taj Mahal or any of the Asian lagers they have on the menu. Save some room for dessert! Their mango yogurt pudding and rice pudding is to-die-for."
"5.0","I went on Sunday for their buffet lunch and it was SO good. We went because my Indian friend says it's one of the only Indian restaurants he likes in Pittsburgh. It did not disappoint. The selection for the lunch buffet is quite authentic and a mix of south and north Indian cuisine. They have naan, rice, curries, chutneys, a mix of meat and vegetarian dishes, and will bring out dosa to your table. Everything was really flavorful. I feel like it was helpful going with someone who is familiar with the cuisine because they had a number of dishes I wasn't too familiar with, even though I have traveled in India before and have frequented Indian restaurants in the past. I'm giving this place five stars because the service is good, ambiance is nice, price is great (a little under $10 for the lunch buffet), and the food is fantastic. Such a unique and varied selection that I don't normally see elsewhere. (Makes it a fun meal if you're into trying new foods.) I'm definitely planning to go back soon!"
"5.0","I love this place. I am a fan of coffee, not tea so I am biased. But I had this amazing coconut cream chocolate banana something or other blend (it wasn't full of sugary flavoring or anything, it was just the tea) and it was one of the best cups of tea ever. The woman working behind the counter (I think she was the owner) knew all of the teas and could tell me about every blend and flavor. It is a great space and has an extensive menu. I am not from the area, but if I were, I would be there all the time."
"4.0","Cheap food, excellent service. Not being from a city, most Middle Eastern food joints I've been to caters to the bland American palate. Note this place. I can't wait to go back to Pitt and eat here again."
"5.0","Hello. I dined at this eat n park for dinner on January 28th, 2016. I ordered pancakes. They tasted nice. Thank you."
"5.0","The homemade Italian is very good. Authentic. We go quite a bit. We sit outside often with our dog. Ask for Delaney or Steph. They do a great job waiting on us. Try it."
"4.0","I first heard of this place through their mailer ad.  Their menu is very large (pasta to gyros to salads, not to mention their actual pizzas) which I think hurts them a bit.  I read a review on a different site that gave them a low rating based on their soups, but I don't think this should be representative of their pizza.  Come on people!  If you're going to order out to a pizza place, get the freakin' pizza!  Which brings me to my next point: their pizza is absolutely delicious!  The best part is their fantastic crust, which is just the right amount of chewiness and crispiness and taste.  Some people prefer a really thick or thin crust, so I should mention that theirs is a little bit on the thick side, but it's always cooked perfectly (no dough-iness).  I've tried their specialty Seafood Pizza as well as their Artichoke Pizza and both were loaded with toppings and tasted sooooo good.  I also have tasted their plain cheese pizza, which was tasty also.  Their prices are incredibly reasonable (especially for the specialty pizzas) and keep in mind that their 'medium' pizza is like a large at Pizza Hut or Papa Johns.  I have had the pizza delivered as well as chosen to pick it up.  They might be a little slow when delivering because they offer to deliver to such a huge area, so the smart thing to do might be to call in for pick up.  So in closing, skip all the 'fluff' on their menu and try one of their specialty pizzas.    You won't be disappointed!"
"3.0","This is the slowest coffee shop I have ever been to in my entire life.  It took them almost 15 minutes to get me a small cup of black coffee and an iced coffee.    Every other customer in the shop waited an excessively long time as well.  The only positives are that the employees are very nice and the shop is beautiful and comfortable to hang out in."
"5.0","Was walking down the street one day and stumbled upon Arnold's, all I can say is that I am glad.  The first thing I noticed was the space and the decor, both pleasing. I have enjoyed many teas and sandwiches since then, and hope the Arnold's continues to expand on the menu."
"4.0","Thanks to Tamarind, I think I've found my new favorite Indian dish: Saag. It's like an indian version of creamed spinach.YUM!"
"4.0","The food here is really good.  The samosas are large and tasty.  The lamb curry had a great flavor and the lamb was very tender.  The naan and rice were also very good.  i had this delivered through grub hub and the deliver was super fast.  I will definitely eat here again."
"1.0","Service was slightly below average.  The food was horrible and burnt.  Even the soda was flat in a mixed drink.  We will not be going back to that establishment."
"5.0","Had the Mediterranean Omelet and could eat this for breakfast everyday. It was delicious with some of the best coffee I've ever had. Great service, very cool decor. Love eating here!"
"5.0","ALWAYS excellent customer service at this location. Every single time my husband and I go the employees are always so friendly - I love it! Also, best fast food burgers out there. I wish there were other locations in the Pittsburgh area!"
"4.0","Very greasy but good food. Mild was barely spicy. Prices seemed good. Lots of college student traffic. Wait was only about 5 minutes for the food. Fast food speed but had the taste of a southern BBQ."
"5.0","This place was a nice find on the strip. We ducked in not expecting much, but ended up having a delicious breakfast for a reasonable price. I had the special, which consisted of fried eggs atop a bbq beef hash. The bbq was flavorful, with a spicy kick at the end that had me finishing my plate in record time. The coffee was also pretty good, and the free refills were a nice added bonus. I'm looking forward to visiting the next time I'm in Pittsburgh, and seeing what else their menu has to offer!"
"3.0","I used to love this place, it is truly one of Pittsburgh's jewels.  I always found their food to be good up until my last two visits.  The last two times I was left with really bad stomach cramps the next day or two after eating there.  This makes me really sad because when I had the food before it was amazing.  The service is always great and the pricing is perfect for the amount of food you get.  I do not know if the issue is just with me and my stomach but sadly I think I have to lay off this place for awhile."
"5.0","Love love love this place. It's small but I've never had a bad experience here. They always have different specials on what to order, all of which are to die for! Every time I come I get 2 tacos, they're made so authentically you can't go wrong eating here. In the summer time they have tables outside so you can enjoy the weather and their amazing food. The chicken they make is so flavorful, the employees are so nice and sincere, all around a great place to eat. I will most certainly continue to be a returning customer."
"4.0","Most of Downtown Pittsburgh unfortunately closes down on holidays and the day before a holiday; however, Fernando's Cafe was fortunately open on Christmas Eve, so this is where I went for lunch today.Because it's Christmas Eve, the store was pretty empty. The staff were friendly and the food came out in a timely manner.I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich, which was today's special - A foot long with a pop and chips / cookie cost $7.25 (the same as your $5 foot long meal).  Although the preparation is longer than your Subway / Jimmy John's, the wait is worth it!My only complaint about the food is the messiness of the sub. It could be because I like to add a little hot sauce and ranch to my buffalo chicken sandwich, but it was a little messy to eat - make sure to have napkins handy.Fernando's offers more than subs such as soups, salad, and pizza, so I will be sure to go back for lunch again."
"4.0","Sausalido is located in Bloomfield.  The restaurant itself is rather small, consisting of two floors for seating.  Tables are kind of tight in the downstairs dining area, but it gives a quaint feel.  We had reservations and were seated promptly.  Due to the relative size of the place, I would recommend making a reservation in advance.  This restaurant is also a BYOB place, which is awesome.The menu is not overly elaborate, but offers a good amount of options when it comes to your protein for the main course.  They offer a pork chop, crap cakes, hangar steak, seafood specials (salmon, monkfish), shrimp risotto and duck.  They also have a pasta option as well as an squash lasagna.  Our table ordered around the menu and everything was cook fantastically.  Judging by the empty plates, I think it is a safe assumption that everyone loved their meals.The staff here is quite prompt and friendly.  Very efficient when it came to refilling waters, clearing plates and most importantly, opening when necessary.  Everyone was fantastic.One item of note, if you are in a group of 6 or more, gratuity is automatically included in your bill.  You receipt will still show your 'tipping' options at the bottom, so just be aware it was already included, but feel free to tip more!This is a great little BYOB spot in Bloomfield.  Each time I have been here I have never been disappointed.  I will certainly be returning."
"4.0","Another must stop when I'm in Pittsburgh. Usually seat yourself on the weekdays, but CASH ONLY (hence the 4 star rating). Similar to a greasy spoon, but with more creative and tasty food. Get the crepe pancakes to share with the table - DELICIOUS, thin pancakes! The edges have a different taste (crispier) than the middle, but all of it is just amazingly delicious."
"2.0","Just got the food truck today. A burger and fries combo for $11. Burger and fries were small to average size. They did not have lettuce tomato or other normal toppings. They gave examples of what to put on it but all did not fit my taste for a burger. Would be better jus to list all topping they have and jus tell the customer to pick three bc that's what happens anyways. Slightly overpriced for the burger and fries. Would like to spend 9-10. Not worth it to buy again in my opinion. Did not have a ketchup dispenser jus gave you one individual packet. Burger itself was lacking flavor. Needs to add some seasoning to the bland frozen burger. Overall wouldn't get that meal again. Maybe a hot dog. But not worth my time or money again."
"5.0","Fantastic hot chicken joint in Oakland. The service is friendly and helpful. The menu is simple, which is nice. For the traditionalist, the chicken is served as tenders/planks - not on the bone. Alcohol is available for those who desire a nip with their meal. Another item of note; NO CASH - credit/debit cards only.  Atmosphere is very relaxed with a good amount of seating and TVs playing sports.  We tried the tenders, chicken-n-waffles and the salad which were all awesome. PS - the damn hot flavor lives up to its name!  Go to place for hot chicken when in the 'Burgh."
"5.0","Love it here. Right in the water and right in the middle of everything on the north side. Service is always excellent and the food is well above average for a sports grill. If you love Pittsburgh and you love sports this place is a must."
"5.0","Been looking for something new for a breakfast place and came across this Bloomfield gem. We got French toasts and they were delicious! It was really hard to pick though because everything sounded really good lol. Also, the atmosphere is really lovely, so is the staff. We will definitely be back. Highly recommend!"
"4.0","The food was good they give you large portions so it is worth the money.  Prices are reasonable.  The employees serving food and at the cash register were very nice and polite.  I got the chicken chili and curry chicken with rice.  Plenty of parking in strip."
"5.0","Primanti Brothers is where you go for a cliche 'I went to Pittsburgh' Instagram photo...Peppi's...Peppi's is where you go when you actually want an AMAZING, DELICIOUS, HANDCRAFTED, WORK OF ART, DELECTABLE sandwich."
"5.0","New favorite coffee shop in Pittsburgh. The tea is tasty, and there are plenty of options. There is also sooo much seating, which makes it an amazing place to study and do work. The staff is friendly, and there is free wifi. There are also huge windows that let in a lot of natural light. A beautiful space, and I hope that it stays open for the summer that I am here, because I have a feeling that I will be coming here a lot!"
"5.0","My partner and I went here before going to our first ballet. Our server 'Ton' was passionate kind and well versed on the entire menu he made our experience a great one and everything we had was delicious.The runners were also very fast, efficient and we had no wait from dirty dishes on our table to fresh drinks. I never had to ask for anything which was very different. Its service and servers like this that really make you realize what a restaurant experience should be. I left inspired. And I say this as a Manager in this local food Industry. Thanks for hosting a beautiful date for my partner and I to remember. We hope to be back soon."
"4.0","Food is superb. Service exceptional. Portions huge, especially desserts !Ambiance warm, old world. Good place for intimate tête-à-tête or conversation with friends. Only reason for 4 stars is a bit over priced. You'll need to take out a second mortgage."
"5.0","We didn't know what to expect based on the exterior of the bar.  It looked a little shady from the outside, but once we stepped inside we were greeted with a very nice interior and a decent sized bar.  The bartender was extremely friendly and the food (a burger and the cheese sticks) was great!"
"5.0","Favorite bar in Pittsburgh! Good music choices on the touch tunes, great drink specials, the best staff ever, trivia Mondays & karaoke on Tuesdays, solid bar food, lots of space, etc! Not to mention darts and pool!"
"1.0","Portland attitudePittsburgh tasteThe service was resentfulThe owner was doucheyGo back to Austin/Portland"
"5.0","We were killing time before lunch in Bloomfield and stumbled upon the Azorean Cafe and decided to stop in and grab a coffee. Well, all I can say is what a good find! It may not look like much from the outside, a long room, with small tables down one side, but it's spacious and bright, very clean, and there's a community room at the back with a big TV. (There was some sort of birthday celebration going on while we were there in the community room). The owners are lovely and very hospitable, I went to order at the counter but they insisted that we sat down and that they would come to us.In addition to very good coffee (Intelligensia roast and mix a special blend for the cafe) the cafe has a small market that sells Portuguese products such as preserves and canned fish as well as bread and baked goods to go. There is also a kitchen that prepares sandwiches, breakfasts, omelettes, lunch specials and meat or fish casseroles. We didn't stay to eat as we had other plans but all the food that I saw looked delicious and was attractively presented. Everything was very reasonably priced and we will definitely be back to eat that wonderful looking food next time we are in the 'burgh."
"4.0","Sunday breakfast stop today. Had the omelet with spinach ,red peppers and cheddar cheese, very good sized and very tasty. The potatoes were really good, cooked perfectly and not dried out at all. Toast was extra but it was just simple toast. Challah french toast wad the winner here with 4 large halves of toast with fruit and whipped cream. It was made perfectly,  not mushy at all and neither was it too crispy, it was just right! Good coffee and lots of bottled drinks to pick from as well. I can't wait to try it out for lunch sometime soon."
"5.0","Edgar's Best Tacos catered our graduation party.  The food was awesome.  Everyone commented positively about the food.  They also have a restaurant in Pittsburgh as well.  We will be making a visit soon.  Our friends from Mexico City said this made them feel right at home.  The food is fresh, authentic and great tasting.  Enjoy!!"
"1.0","Very disappointed! Our food took a very long time with no updates or apologizes from waitress.  Table next to us who got seated a significant amount of time after us and got food before us. When food was brought two items were missing and we got a very rude response from waitress. Manager was not very sympathetic and tried to make jokes of our concerns. Overall, a very disappointing experience!"
"5.0","I needed this, so so so badly!!!  Pure pleasure awaits, just pick your fix.  Sandwich soup dessert coffee it's all premium...  I need more"
"5.0","I have nothing but good things to say about The Capital Grille! My boyfriend and I have been a few times and the service and food have been amazing each time. I know this is a steak house but I highly recommend the tuna. It was absolutely delicious as was the lobster Mac n cheese! The lobster bisque was great too, lots of lobster in it! Our server Amber was wonderful. We mentioned that we were there for a late valentines dinner and at the end of our meal she brought out 2 complimentary desserts! Cheesecake and chocolate espresso cake, omg they were to die for and the perfect size. She also gave me a rose for valentines as well, which was super sweet. This restaurant is a bit on the expensive side but if you have a special occasion this is the place to come to get a great meal plus they treat you like gold! It's an all around great dining experience that is so worth it!"
"4.0","I love coming to The Summit not only because it's in walking distance, but because the vibe and unique craft concoctions are nothing short of crave-able. Dark and mellow and usually with some sort of jazz playing on the speakers, being inside the Summit is relaxing for a quick spell after work or late night. The bartenders are SO knowledgeable and friendly. Watching them make cocktails is a work of art. I've never tried the food, but it always looks yummy and carefully crafted. If you've got the time and a bit of extra money, it's worth a stop to the Summit. Play some board games at the tables next to the open garage doors and watch the foot traffic on Shiloh St, or sit at the bar and watch the bartenders crank out drinks. Then, stop on Grandview nearby and check out the best view of the city in all its glory."
"5.0","Awesome.We ordered delivery and got the Shrimp Curry, 'hot' spicy and got some Naan. It was delicious. Will definitely order from here again. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who digs Indian cuisine."
"5.0","Stopped before coming to a show at heinz hall. We ordered the inside out grilled cheese. It was awesome! I'm usually weary about ordering grilled cheese anywhere since you can make so cheap at home but the waiter suggested it. Stuffed with cheese, bacon, tomato, then burnt cheese wrapped around the bread. It was large portion and could only eat half. Definitely a must order. Leftovers were just as good. Waiter was friendly and helpful"
"5.0","Good service, good food, good atmosphere. Any time I go back to Pittsburgh I definitely will visit again. Our waitress was polite and timely and our food came out great and even though it was busy because it was game day we didn't have to wait too long."
"5.0","A buddy and I were in town for the Steelers game.  We usually visit the strip district for a few drinks before venturing out for dinner.On a whim, we decided on Luke's and boy what a gem we found.  Now I'm a sucker for king crab legs.  For years I've been saying that the best Alaskan king crab I've ever had was on the shores of the Chena River in Fairbanks, Alaska at a place called The Pumphouse (I think, it's been a while).Regardless, the king crab at Luke's ran a very close second and maybe has even overtaken the top spot.  My buddy got the surf and turf and he was able to cut the filet with a butter knife.  If you are ever in da 'burgh I highly recommend Luke's!"
"5.0","Great employees, delicious pizza.  It's almost like SUBWAY, but in a pizza way.  They offer gluten free dough.  Even though it's a new location, it's worth the wait.  I had the spicy red sauce with my choices of toppings (pepperoni, sausage, prosciutto, spinacj, pineapple and a drizzle of evil), I almost cried that it was that good...it doesn't have that pizzeria atmosphere, but I do hope that it stays around and grows.  I will definitely travel back out to Lawrenceville, PA to get more of that pizza.  I tip my hat to the business.I've had pizza from multiple states and cities, by far, The Best EVER!  even better than NYC pizza."
"5.0","I've been consistently impressed with the fresh healthy salads, panini, pizza, and soup. Fresh ingredients, nice flavors, and they also have beer and wine. As an added perk, special bins for recycling and composting. This is one of the best places to get a salad in Oakland."
"4.0","Mmmm. Crepe pancakes. What an idea. 4.25 stars (sure, I can give quarter stars, why not).Per the bf's suggestion, we went to Pamela's for brunch, on our first stop of our day trip in Pittsburgh. Hmmm..... a brunch place, you say? Why not! Cool decor inside- half hipster, half well....midwest diner. Our wait wasn't really that long- we put in our name at around 11:30am on the Saturday of Labor Day weekend, and was seated within 30 minutes. In the meantime while we waited, we checked out the cool Mexican place above Pamela's. Cool.He got the standard breakfast special - which was standard, there's no way to really rate that stuff- and choc chip banana hotcakes. I ordered the blueberry hotcakes.His choc chip banana hotcakes were so so good. Bananas stuffed into a thin crepe of a pancake with the chocolate all melting inside.....omg, it was good. My blueberry crepe pancakes seemed to be extra crispy (which I liked, by the way) with brown sugar and sour cream in it. I felt like there needed to be more stuffing in it, but it was still pretty good.Coffee was standard here as well. But I LOVEEEeeee diners, so this was a place that was above your normal diner. Cool. I still crave those crepe hotcakes...."
"3.0","agh, been here twice and absolutely love the vibe (although the music was just excessively loud for such a small crowded space). BUT the food is just disappointing every time i went! The menu was different with small eats and seemed well thought out, so I was excited and really wanted to like it. But dang, the execution fell so short and so far from expectation. I got a chirashi bowl the first tome, and while its not bad, it was not fresh or great in any way either. The second time came with a lot of people, we had cocktails and skewers and my friend got ramen. The ramen was so freaking salty and like i know they'd probably will come at you with the excuse of ramen broth suppose to be salty but NO it does not. I have lived in Japan and had ramen for years and it does not taste remotely that salty. The skewers were just absolutely burnt to the stick, dry beyond chewable, and left your mouth feeling like a desert. sad *in trump*"
"3.0","Good bartenders and our server did fine but our steaks were very over cooked. Would come again just not for steak entrees"
"5.0","Not just tea - but also great tea! Had a fantastic grilled sandwich, lemon green tea with fresh shaved ginger, and lovely Italian mele. They feature both soy and almond milk in addition to dairy, have local honey and stevia, and green takeout containers. My mouth and tummy are having a VERY good day! Service was prompt and extremely friendly and the space is gorgeous - open, natural wood floors, exposed brick, tons of light, and soft jazz in the background - this place is not just tea."
"3.0","Fish is good n fresh! But I don't get very full from here...Music also too loud. Complained multiple times to turn it down but staff didn't do anything about it. They never have any seating so I would recommend making a reservation first."
"5.0","Delicious! Reminds me of my hometown, LA. Hands down the most authentic (and tasty) tacos in Pittsburgh.I liked these tacos so much I had them cater (yes, they do catering!!) a work event, and everyone went wild! They were very friendly, professional, clean and punctual. They also handled our tax exemption form nicely. All in all, it was a wonderful experience!"
"4.0","Lunch decisions are often difficult in the US Steel Tower. If you work or have ever worked there, you understand the difficulty of getting anywhere at lunch time. With people everywhere and long waits for elevators, the lunch hour is basically over by the time you get your food if you choose to eat anywhere in the building. That being said, Craftwork is worth the wait and the lines! Their staff is fast and they do a good job of keeping the line moving and turning orders out in just a few minutes.I have tried a number of items here and everything has been fresh and full of flavor. My current favorite is the buffalo chicken sandwich. Instead of the usual fried slab of chicken drenched in buffalo sauce, their version is filled with chicken that has been shredded and coated in sauce. The sauce itself is spicy and has a little more flavor to it than your typical wing sauce. If you're a buffalo chicken lover, this won't disappoint.They also make amazing fries! The sandwiches are big, but you need these fries so find someone to split an order with or just get them on Friday (because it doesn't count on Fridays, duh). You can get them just about any way you want, as far as sauces go, but I recommend getting a side of the chipotle mayo. It's creamy and spicy and will make even the worst of days right.It can get a little pricey, but that seems to be the case with just about every establishment in USX. I would still much rather support an independent option than one of the equally expensive chains in the building."
"5.0","Excellent food and even greater service!  New bar menu specials and drink specials 4:30 to 6:30.  I would highly recommend to come join the family atmosphere"
"5.0","Big fan of these folks from the street stand days. Great tacos and burritos. Used to be only the stand a couple of blocks away, but now they have this pretty big restaurant and bar space. I saw the street food truck parked along the side as well. It currently looks like they're shaping the the place up ... getting their alcohol license in place, giving the interior some sprucing up, etc ... so I'm rating 5 stars for the authentic Mexican street grub and friendly staff. I just added the new location to Yelp myself after seeing only the old street stand was listed and I'd like them to have a strong 5 star base to start from. Check em out for a quick bite if you're in the area. I'm hoping Edgar's will do well here. Enjoy!"
"2.0","This place has gone so down hill. I used to like eating here at the casino but this last trip was awful. It was a Tuesday night, the place was empty and the service was god awfully slow. Everything we had was disgusting. We left all only having a few bites of our meals. The 'filet' COULDN'T have been filet. It was the driest, grossest meat Ive ever had. Tasted like a frozen meat patty. The crab mac and cheese had imitation crab meat in it...and the cheese sauce was scarce and completely flavorless. It was more or less a bowl of plain noodles with chunks of fake crab. Yum....never again."
"5.0","I loved this little brunch nook in Bloomfield! Because it is situated right next to Children's Hospital, it's in a perfect spot for those visiting the hospital as well as those just looking for a great new brunch spot to try. When I came, I first ordered a caramel latte. I'm not exactly the biggest coffee enthusiast, but I know high quality when I taste it. And this latte was excellent! My sister had a plain coffee and commented on the quality as well. I ordered the Chèvre omelet, and loved it. However, my sister ordered the buffalo chicken crepe, and I was a little jealous I hadn't ordered a crepe myself! Her meal was fantastic. I would definitely recommend trying a crepe if you come and are into that. If you aren't, there are a lot of other great options on the menu as well."
"5.0","One of my favorite Japanese restaurants!! The restaurant does not seat too many parties, so I would recommend making a reservation beforehand.I wasn't too hungry when I got to Umami, so I was looking for something light. I made the right choice going with the eggplant dish, and I savored every bite of it.-- taste / 5aesthetics / 5vibe / 5service / 4price for quality / 5OVERALL / 5"
"3.0","This place is a hidden gem in the Strip District.  Not only do they have some delicious food, the service and atmosphere are great as well.The place is setup in an older style lunch spot way.  You order as you walk in from a chalkboard and seat yourself.  Everything from the plates to the seating go with their overall theme.  The kitchen is open to the restaurant which is a cool look.  The workers could not have been more friendly.  They gave us their picks for the best meal and side dish options.  They also got us our food very fast.For my meal I had the blues burger.  It had bacon, blue cheese crumbles, and blue cheese sauce.  The flavors all came together it tasted delicious.  The peppercorn crusting was a little much and It was over cooked for the medium rare I ordered, but was still great.  Finally, the brioche bun was one of the best burger buns I have ever had and held all of the ingredients together perfectly.I will definitely be back to try some more of their burgers and sandwiches."
"4.0","Came back for a breakfast sandwich and it was AMAZING.  The bacon was super crispy and the bread was light.  They also use real eggs, which you don't always get downtown.  Breakfast sandwich rating earns you an additional star!"
"4.0","I went here for restaurant week of Winter 2016.  Upon entering, warm greeting and the waiting area kept me cozy until my guest arrived. When seated, we had a very nice table in a not so crowded dining room, but gave us a great vantage point to be able to see everything that was going on. Our server was very nice and attentive. I ordered a wedge salad, steak and cheesecake for dessert. The food was spot on and overall a great experience."
"5.0","Great food this is the only hardees near me about 30 min but its worth the drive there food is great havent got there burgers yet but had the chicken tenders and there really good"
"5.0","There I was in the South Side on a Saturday, fresh off of a hair appointment.  I was feelin' quite fly and a bit peckish.  I needed to get a bite to eat to tide me over before meeting a friend for a movie and dinner (in that order.  I resigned myself to Subway because it was across the street from my salon and I knew they'd be cheap and fast, and I had no sooner crossed the street when I noticed the sign for Doce Taqueria.  What's this????? A tacqueria in Pittsburgh???? (Okay, I know they exist, but they're so few and far between in this town.)  Without giving it much more thought, I walked in and was hit by the smell of delicious taco fixins.  There was also a counter full of dudes in there, and I was the only female besides the one working.  It was a little awkward.  I felt like I was invading a Boys Only fort or a secret meeting of the Loyal Order of the Water Buffalo or whatever.  Anyway, I got over that really quickly because this tiny place is full of legit taco goodness.  They have several types to choose from, plus a daily special.  Carnitas, ground beef, chicken, and probably a veggie option if you want it.  I had to hold myself to two tacos served the CORRECT way on two small corn tortillas a piece (I'm judging you if you pick flour), and they were both delicious.  Hell, you can even get a walking taco if you fancy one.  They stay open until quite late on the weekends, which means they must make a killing on the South Side bar crowd.  I'm quite glad that I was able to experience it on a quiet Saturday afternoon, and there's a likely chance that hitting this spot up will be part of my hair appointment routine."
"1.0","If I could leave zero stars - I would - this place treats their customers unjustly and I will never return and neither will any of my friends. Way too many other great bars in the city of Pittsburgh to waste your time and money here."
"1.0","I ordered the delivery several times. They always missed the drinks I ordered. I tried to call them but never got any answers. The food is ok but the service is so disappointing."
"4.0","i love the style of this diner! you get there and stand in line to order (the menu is big on the wall but they also have physical menus at the counter you can grab while in line if you can't see or want more time to look at it) they have a nice lunch and breakfast menu. i've had an omelette and a two egg breakfast on separate visits and my boyfriend got the turkey gouda wrap (i forget the exact name). the omelette and eggs (overeats) were both so so.. they weren't bad but nothing to write home about. the bacon is super greasy and not really crispy (i like my really crispy) but the potatoes were awesome! my favorite thing both times i went haha. my boyfriend loved his wrap! he said it was really good but a little spicy! (he liked but i know some people don't like spicy and he wasn't expecting it to be).. i always get the coffee when i'm there and it's okay too a again nothing to write home about. overall though i love the place and have already been there a few times"
"4.0","I have heard so many good things about La Gourmandine since they opened their downtown location. I went for lunch and got the prosciutto and pickle sandwich. The bread was amazing and the prosciutto and little pickles paired perfectly. I felt like the sandwich was missing something, as that's all that was on it; a whole grain mustard would have been a nice addition to offer. My friend and I wished they offered a 1/2 sandwich and soup combo.. Soup sounded good but not with a full sandwich already, nor for an extra $5. I realize they're new and might offer something like that down the road.I got an almond croissant to share which was AMAZING! And then afterwards, I tried the salted caramel Macaron and loved that too.Everything tasted so fresh; I plan to frequent this spot for lunch often."
"4.0","It's food n convenance food...my favorite is the lamb kabab...they amazing and fresh made..also there fish and rice are so yummy...go more often there"
"3.0","The miso soup was delicious; tasted so authentic. The service was very good; kind and polite. Our food came out cold, however (not counting the sushi). And the teriyaki sauce was sticky and hardening. Unimpressed, will not be returning."
"5.0","This new Mediterranean place is a perfect hideaway from the hustle and bustle of Downtown Pittsburgh. This restaurant opened in September 2019 however, I think they have truly achieved the homey feel a well loved neighborhood restaurant encompasses.I tried the lunch buffet which was $9.99. If I worked downtown, I would take advantage of the buffet every week. This is one of the best value buffet meals I have had in the Pittsburgh area. The buffet had two meats-chicken and steak. There was also rice, lentil soup and an appetizer bar. The appetizer bar had grape leaves, salad, hummus, tzatziki sauce and other items. Everything was delicious. My only gripe was I wish the lentil soup had a bit more flavor. The meats were very moist and perfectly seasoned. Fresh pita bread was even served to my table for the hummus. To top it off, there were even slices of bundt cakes for dessert!I was a big fan and definitely felt at peace being in this restaurant. I left satisfied and gracious."
"5.0","Love love love the atmosphere and the beer!! Super cool place to hang out, relax and enjoy the beer. We were able to sit outside with our pup! Highly recommend for a Sunday funday"
"4.0","Located in really good location and has pretty good atmosphere inside the restaurant. The food tasted really well. I liked the egg kothu parotta with the chicken curry. It tasted soo good. I would recommend for a quick buffet. I would advise the restaurant to have little for options to try out."
"5.0","Why did I wait so long to return to this charming place? Although the menu has lots of tempting options I couldn't resist their delicious French Toast with berries and a perfect Caffe Latte. The service was attentive and the owners are so welcoming!"
"4.0","For me, this is the place that sets the bar for Thai food. It's where I first fell in love with green curry and the place I first tried som tum (papaya salad). I've tried nearly everything on the menu, and only found one dish that I didn't enjoy (a fish curry that I would probably enjoy now, as my palate has broadened).When you're hungry, you can't beat their lunch specials, and the atmosphere is as real as it gets. This is a true family restaurant, run by good people.Also, this is both a great place to have a group dinner, or to eat alone at the counter, as the service is both fast and unrushed at the same time."
"4.0","This place came highly recommended and I can see why. The green curry with tofu was incredible. I went with a spice level of 7, and would bump it up to an 8 or 9 next time, but the flavor was spot on. Spring rolls were delicious. Service was quick and friendly. It's so close to my office I can see becoming a regular!"
"4.0","Visited here for the first time today and got gua bao sliders which had pork belly like meat in the middle and some veggies along with hoisin sauce, which tastes sort of like a sweeter thick soy sauce. I never ordered from this place before but I dont regret a single bit of it. I got a alarm thing, which beeped when my food was ready. It took around 5-8ish minutes to get my food after I ordered. The potatoes were decent and wasn't really special but I ain't complaining"
"3.0","Finally got to stop by here even though it was so cold out. But I had to travel to Oakland for work so I figured I might as well make it worth it and get a fried chicken sandwich! We went around noon and it was pretty packed but we managed to find a seat and the wait for our food wasn't that bad. Note: they don't accept cash. I have to say I was a little disappointed by my sandwich. I got the medium spice level and it was waaaaaaay too salty. I think it was the breading because once I got about half way through my sandwich, it was a little better but still way too salty. My boyfriend said that his was also salty but not nearly as salty as mine. I felt a little bleh after we went home because of it. I probably just got a bad batch. However their fries are delicious and I loved their fry dust. There was a touch of sweetness in it and it was perfect. I loved the slaw and pickles on top of their sandwiches. Prices aren't too bad for the amount of food that you get. I think I'd come back again but try something else on their menu; I took a peek at the other customers around us and everything looked delicious! I love the idea of having a quality fried chicken in Oakland; I would've eaten it up while I was in undergrad."
"3.0","I've eaten here a few times now, and this review is really intended to kind of cover each experience, hence the three star rating. Now, the food here is usually pretty good, and it's a fun place to watch a game. The location really is top notch as well. The biggest issue here really is, as one reviewer put it below, the service. Even when the place isn't slammed, the service staff are fairly lackadaisical in checking in on you, and there was one instance where I was seated at a dirty table.Now, the thing about this place is, even with the inconsistent service, for the location, the prices and the food are really good. If they could really buckle down on servers, they'd be an amazing place to stop."
"5.0","LOVE this place! Fantastic burgers, awesome rosemary fries, D-licious mac n cheese, smooth beers,..., what else do you need?"
"4.0","Great food, it tasted really good! Went for weekend buffet, they have limited items compared to usual buffet spread from other restaurant but everything tasted good. The place was busy when we entered and looks like they dont have enough staff to handle the customers.I see only one guy working as waiter, bus boy, cleaning the tables and doing so other work. It was wired to see that!! I dont know if thats a cost saying model but it is effecting the service!! There were no enough plates.. and the items were not being refiled properly!! Had to wait for long time and by the time it arrived i was already full!!"
"4.0","Stopped by here this morning for breakfast with some friends! We got there as soon as it opened but within the span of like an hour, the place was fully packed when we left. There was a line right out the door.I got the House smoked brisket hash and it was delicious and the portion was large. Potatoes were cooked perfectly and there was actually a lot of brisket, which was good! The general consensus with this establishment: large portions and delicious (also pretty!)Their pancakes are delicious... perfectly fluffy and dense but not too sweet; literally perfect. However, it's a little pricey. That's my only complaint! I think for my dish and my boyfriend's, it came out to $26. Pretty expensive for breakfast in my opinion, but I would come here again if I ever found myself in the strip."
"4.0","Went there last summer. The food is great, but the thing that I'm not a huge fan of is how small and packed it it in there. In the mornings you can't get a spot so you give them your cell phone number and they call you when a spot clears up. The food I liked the most is their bacon or pancakes. The waiters/waitresses are very professional about everything. You can tell that they have been waiting tables for a while. The wait for your food is not long once you order. I recommend it for people that aren't in a hurry to get breakfast."
"5.0","I'm so glad I finally got to stop in here! Every time I ride my bike I always thinking about stopping. The other day my fiancé and I stopped in to grab a coffee and tea. She got the lavender lemonade tea. It was a little bitter but the barista sweetened it a bit which made it better. I would definitely order it again. I got the coffee latte with milk. It was more just coffee and milk than a latte. There was no foam in the drink at all. Either way the coffee had good flavor. The mood is very welcoming inside to anyone! There were kids with their parents, people working on laptops and couples talking around the corner. There is a big couch to lounge on and an electronic fireplace to make the room even more cozy! I am excited to visit in the future again to try more items on the menu. If you live in North Side this is a must go to place!"
"3.0","I guess I like Pamelas.Their hotcakes are awesome, though they do need to distribute their brown sugar around instead of getting them in lumps here and there.  Their potatoes are good; I like 'em.  Their corned beef hash is mixed with their potatoes, which I dig, except that their corned beef is too salty :(.  Their tex mex omelete is pretty bad, but I guess that's Pittsburgh.Despite that, I still go to Pamelas too often for my wallet's liking."
"5.0","V3 has great atmosphere. It's fast, hot and delicious! BYOB overall a great pizza joint. The flatbreads are fantastic."
"1.0","2 Band Experiences at this Restaurant:1. Hair in my Turkey Gyro2. A Year Later, no Turkey in my Turkey GryoIts a shame the food is tasty but after these 2 bad experiences i won't be spending my lunch here anymore!"
"4.0","Great new neighborhood bar in Mt. Washington!  The Summit is a dimly-lit (a plus in my book) bar that offers an oft-changing (also good!) menu of craft cocktails.  Over the winter, my favorite of these was a spiked hot cider drink.  These guys also make a damn good Manhattan.If you're looking for a decent selections of bourbons, whiskeys, and ryes, this is also your place.They usually have some interesting beers and wines on the menu as well, and I was pleased one weekend to learn that they carry Prosecco, too. Yes, you can pop bottles.There's a shelf with games in case your group wants to play drunk Jenga.  There are a few small tables with chairs, but I think the use of the space is good.  There are soft-cushioned stools at the bar.  I'm a big fan of the owners/men behind the bar, who are friendly and knowledgeable about their drinks.  The usual bouncer is often reading an interesting book at his post.My only complaint is the music:  it's usually loud hip hop.  For a cool craft-cocktail place with dark atmosphere, the music seems off.  It's hard to hear people talk and it's not like it's a dance club!  But it may just be my personal preference."
"4.0","I recently visited Mezzo for the first time and had an excellent experience. I made a reservation online about a week prior to the Wednesday dinner. I browsed the menu online in anticipation of the meal. The friendly hostess seated our party of five at a comfortable six-top right by the window overlooking lively Penn Ave. Our courteous server guided us through the menu that offers a pleasing variety of food and drinks - including more options than are listed online. The highlights of my meal include the charcuterie board, the cheese board, and the lamb entree. The wine pairing was spot on.  The portions were elegant and satisfying. Everyone in my party enjoyed their meal. Our server was attentive and relaxed - keeping pace with our leisurely group. I highly recommend Mezzo for the delicious food, service, decor, and location. It's my new downtown go-to Italian restaurant."
"5.0","We arrived at our hotel down the street, yelped sushi near our location, and Kiku popped up.  Perfect!  After realizing it was 2:45 pm and they close at 3 pm, we called in a to go order.  When we arrived to pick up our order, they offered to have us eat in even though they were supposed to close in 4 minutes. We ordered an appetizer also, curry calamari (VERY delicious!).  The rolls were perfect and fresh, friendly servers, nice atmosphere... Will definitely be back when we are in the area!"
"3.0","Quick & friendly service. Lots to choose from and convenient location. Thanks a bunch :)"
"4.0","The food was very good and the fries were wonderful - crisp and seasoned. I rarely find very good fries - especially in a busy restaurant. The service was really good and very friendly. The happy hour drink specials are decent, but their 'domestic draft' special only includes the base horrible American beers - it doesn't include the American ciders or good American beers.Thankfully, our waitress told us that it excluded what we were ordering.I'll definitely return."
"4.0","Wow - incredible food!  The waiter was hesitant to recommend what I ordered because it wasn't his favorite and it was really wonderful (I ate vegetarian -- Baingan Bartha and a side of Aloo Paratha). Fast, friendly service, in a relaxed setting. It smells so good in here I wish I could stay all night!!  Don't miss this place!"
"5.0","Deliciously amazing tacos! I loved the black bean veggie. Vegan option also available. Corn or flour shell. Other tacos looked like ground beef, chicken and pork. There was also some nacho side options I saw. Small inside with limited seated at the bar, maybe around 12 people could sit inside total. No table seating so takeout is a great option. Served quick and out the door in under 5 minutes. I will most certainly be back!"
"5.0","This is old school tasty Chinese food. Reasonably priced and nice atmosphere.  My go to Chinese restaurant for a tasty meal. Reminds me of eating in Chinatown in Phila where I grew up. Unfortunate Pittsburgh does not have a real Chinatown anymore and this restaurant is all that remains of a once busy Chinatown. Most everything is tasty and very good portions.  The orange duck sauce is excellent, like a fresh purée and great to dip crunchy noodles in. Bottomless crunchy noodles and tea!"
"4.0","It's simple tasty diner food. I've had the breakfast sandwiches, pancakes, and the Tex breakfast and enjoyed them all and would and have gone back multiple times. Can't speak to the non breakfast food since I haven't had it but everything looks and smells good to me. Sucks that there is usually a line for breakfast."
"5.0","8 bucks for a flatbread pizza with unlimited toppings, great deal especially for a quick but delicious lunch"
"5.0","Good crispy chicken strips. Very flavorful seasoning. It's a gem in Oakland bc not a lot of fast food restaurants will not serve beers in Oakland. So glad to be able to sit down and grab a quick delicious meal with a beer. Despite how many customers there are, the service had been pretty prompt and friendly. I've tried the spicy and extra spicy sandwich and waffles. If you cannot do spicy, I suggest you go w mild or medium. Their spices are not to be joked with... it will sit in your stomach for two days... haven't tried their sides but excited to go back for more!They do not serve bone in chicken, just one type of chicken strips in various styles- sandwich, waffles, or just plain strips."
"5.0","This place is so great. The food is great!!! I had Nutella crepe, it's amazing. Definitely coming back! They have beautiful patio with umbrellas!! Not even pricey"
"4.0","I ordered my meal to takeout so I cannot speak to the eat in experience. My food was delicious. However, the server left me alone with my check when I picked it up, not saying good night or anything. It was odd, especially given the restaurant was practically empty on the Tuesday night I went and there was another server."
"2.0","I generally like idea of Panera. I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich. It was promptly served piping hot. I would be willing to bet that it was cooked ahead and then zapped in the microwave. If somebody from Panera let's me know that they ARE NOT microwaving there stuff I will take this review down.   What next--hot pockets?"
"1.0","The waitress wrote down our orders came back and asked me what I wanted again and I still got the wrong food. I had to go to the bar to get a beer because she wasn't coming to the table and she added it to my bill. A couple of us asked for water and never got them and it took about an hour and a half to get our food. I've never experienced such terrible service. I'll never go back."
"5.0","Finally downtown Pittsburgh expands the healthy lunch options. I stopped at the new Freshii restaurant this afternoon in the Union Trust Building. The service was very fast and efficient and the food was amazing! I got the pangoa bowl and also stopped at their new coffee bar, Union Cup, for a cappuccino. While this was a quick stop before going back to the office, I look forward to eating in there soon with the cool, modern decor and greenery on the walls. Any workers who want a fresh, healthy meal, definitely try it out!"
"5.0","Ok, I don't leave a lot of reviews but holy cow this place. It's a sister restaurant to Stack'd and they just outdid themselves. Very generous serving of crinkle cut fries!!!  I got the mild sammich and my bf got the hot (I talked him out of the 'damn hot'). My only critiques are where the drink station is-it causes some grid lock. Chicken is so tender and juicy and a large serving. Just, really great spot."
"4.0","Stopped by Cafe Mona with a friend of mine this week and were pleasantly impressed with another new bistro.  The interior is eclectic and kind of reminds you of being on vacation somewhere else.  The outdoor seating in the rear is as pleasant as it gets.  Vibrant and colorful and quite airy.  My friend had the chicken pesto salad which looked incredibly fresh and attractively constructed.  I had the Cheese steak crepe which I wanted to try just out of curiosity.  The flavor was exact but the crepe made the dish a whole new experience.  A good part of the menu is crepes and I wast to try many more.  The staff were friendly, courteous and attentive.  But most of all...they smiled and seemed honestly glad to see you.  Quite friendly and gracious."
"4.0","This is a pretty typical taco stand in the strip. They make a good taco that tastes like what a taco should, and generally are pretty good (and fast) about it.My order had a few different types of tacos and they all tasted pretty good. Honestly it's a taco stand, and it's good, there's really not much else to say."
"5.0","Delicious and authentic! There wait staff was friendly as soon as we got there. I've had Thai food before, but their menu had some extra items I'd never heard of. Unique dining area with pictures and decorations everywhere. Truly unique to Bloomfield. The location was easy to get to. Walking distance from my hotel. Tables were small and cozy. Great place for a date or hanging out with friends. The dining room had a lot of people, but it wasn't too noisy. I started with a soup that had lots of mushrooms and seasoned with shrimp. I don't like mushrooms, but this was good. There were a lot, but I ate most of them. My Pad Kee Mow was good, but spicy. The waitress asked and I requested level 5. My lips were burning afterwards.  i couldn't finish it all and my employee didn't either. It came with these good noodles that I've never had before. Definitely go here if you're in the area."
"4.0","Always like the food here. If you're in the area the capital Grille has great steaks but you will pay for it so be prepared. Always go hungry and treat yourself once in a while"
"3.0","Came here, utilized the drive thru.. food came out fast and order was correct. The food was.. well, fast food. No complaints but also nothing to write home about."
"5.0","This place has been on my radar for some time now.  I have heard people talk of it for a long time just making my wait that much longer.  It's like when you want something, but you just can't have it and having it rubbed in your face.I like this place and the way it looks.  It's sleek, and minimal.  Nothing flashy about it, so modern like.  The day that I came here it must have been between busy hours which afforded us the chance to just walk in and sit wherever we wanted.  We chose the bar which made for quick service all around.  The menu is straightforward.  You basically pick what you want, the description is point on which leaves nothing to be questioned.  Which is probably why I had a hard time deciding exactly what I wanted.  But I did end up making a good decision.  I went with the Morningside Burger, that's another thing to love about this place, all the burgers are named after the many different neighborhoods in the city.  More of a play on words than the neighborhood, the Morningside Burger is basically what it sounds like.  Plain and simple, bacon, egg and cheese.  Add some mayo and you got yourself a pretty amazing burger.  A perfectly smashed burger, seasoned so well and when those toppings are there, it's amazing.  A tip if you do get this, go with the dippy egg.  When that yolk breaks you get a little extra added bonus.  As for the side, just go with the fries.  There are other sides you can get, but they won't be like these fries.  Pierogies, mac n cheese, rosemary fries, slaw, mixed greens salad; push them all to the side and go with the fries.  They are definitely hand cut.  No two fries are alike as they are cut literally by hand.  You may get a small fry but the next one may look like a steak fry.  Reminds me of doing something like that at home.  And who could pass up a cold one with this meal?  Not I.  I had the 1890 draft.  This thing tasted so light to me.  Smooth and easy going.  Coming from nearby Zelienople it is a house brewed beer.  One thing to also note here is that they do deliver, with a small fee."
"1.0","Not sure how this establishment received more than one star. I ordered pork fried rice, wonton soup and an egg roll. The rice was extremely dry, as if zero soy sauce was used to prepare this in a wok and they just decided to use frozen rice and a microwave at half strength. The wonton soup tasted as though it had sat around for hours. The noodles were extremely soft even though I ordered upon arrival. Lastly, the egg roll was burnt. How do you burn an egg roll? Nothing but incompetence."
"5.0","I am SO glad we found this place! The inside is lovely and the patio is awesome - under a canopy of colorful umbrellas.My husband and I had the brunch special: 1) fruit or salad, 2) an entree, 3) a crepe, and 4) unlimited coffee or OJ or a latte. The fruit was fresh, dusted with powdered sugar, and served with whipped cream. Our omlettes were giant and served with toasted Tuscan bread and mixed greens with creamy balsamic. The crepes were also giant and paper thin. I got bananas and Nutella - the perfect breakfast dessert. My mocha latter was the best I've had in a really long time. And we got all of that for only $20 per person. I absolutely plan on visiting for brunch again!"
"5.0","One of my favorite burger places. The food is delicious, the toppings are great. Quality options, good drinks and really close to the rest of Lawrenceville."
"2.0","I accidentally got a yuengling after our appetizer. I just want to leave here as soon as possible. I do not enjoy club music at 6pm with dinner. Esp when the sugar bowl is on... Put the football sound on!! You're a sports bar!!! 2 stars for the pierogis BC they were good. Our bill came to 27$ and we came here for happy hour. Tho they forgot to give us happy hour prices. The waiter did fix it.. To then not give us the drink specials. Our bill was 9$ over what it was suppose to be. Staff was clueless. Atmosphere is weird, like they can't figure out if they want to be a Buffalo Wild Wings/ a dance bar with quick bites/ downtown tailgate bar."
"5.0","We ordered food for a graduation party. The food was wonderful: fresh, well seasoned, innovative and packaged to travel. The staff was friendly and solicitous. 5 stars!"
"5.0","This one was on our list of must do's! We had 3 late 20's kids with us- last day of their stay we hit peppy's- it's a smalllllll little random sandwich shop in the strip district. You self order and wait for sandwiches on paper- NO FRILLS!! All three guys ordered the # 7 the Ben Rothesburger-- each one took the first bite and literally made a noise of joy followed by OMGOSH this is sooo good! Last Big Win for the kids food experience in Pittsburgh - full and happy as they left for their flight back Cali. Sandwiches are big - bread is amazing no matter what you order, if your on a food journey this is a must for lunch between shopping or early dinner after long day before you go rest -"
"3.0","GREAT COCKTAILS! Seriously, amazing. If I had to choose, The Sex Tape was my favorite, and not just cause of the name lol. Unfortunately, I can not say anything about the food. I was interested in trying some dishes, but the server/bartender never checked back on us after the first drinks. I wanted another delicious cocktail, so I just ordered at the bar. May it's like that? No servers? The restaurant was really well designed. Super urban. The basement had graffiti along the walls. And again, great cocktails."
"2.0","Am I missing something here?  Bagged shredded lettuce (brown on occasion), mediocre black beans, and too little of the delicious...guacamole and pico de gallo. This is nothing special and certainly nothing to write home about. The tacos were bland. The nachos were something you could get at any sports venue. With the high volume of positive reviews, I expected more. I left underwhelmed and won't be back."
"2.0","6-12 minute wait was actually over 35 minutes.Good food....just not an accurate wait time by any means !"
"5.0","This place trumps every other Indian restaurant I've been to in the Pittsburgh area. The buffet has never disappointed me (though those who enjoy high levels of spiciness may say otherwise), and sometimes they will change up the dishes offered. My favorites have to be the chicken tikka masala and saag. The servers here are welcoming, respectful and attentive. I have never had to ask for my water to be refilled because they are always on top of it. Would definitely recommend."
"1.0","The service was terrible. Our waitress was distant seemed like her cat died or she killed someone. Than we ordered our food and instead of potato pancakes she brought hash browns, which were over salted and terrible. Then we got pie and we were on our second bite, and a very long hair was baked into the filling, barf. She suggested another piece of apple. Overall terrible experience, will never go back. Wish I could give zero stars."
"5.0","I can't believe I have lived in Lawrenceville for three years and this is my first visit. We got the shawarma, tikka masala, samosas, and grape leaves. Everything was absolutely delicious and we spent under $25! The atmosphere isn't the greatest- as its kind of an old middle school cafeteria feel, but the food more than makes up for it! It gets super busy on the weekend but their service is quick and friendly. Highly recommend and can't way to go back!!!"
"5.0","Azorean Café -great spot for Traditional Portuguese food and beverages before the Benfica game at Heinz Field!"
"5.0","Great food so awesome I can't say how much I love this place. The chicken tike is awesome."
"5.0","Best tacos since San Diego. Real street tacos with fresh ingredients. We will be back. Carnitas were delicious! Be prepared to eat on the bench or get food to go."
"1.0","I placed an order thru Uber eats for a buffalo chicken pizza. Upon receiving it I noticed all the fries were burnt ( black and charred even). I called to express this and all the manager cared about was if I had ordered there prior. He didn't offer and redeliver or anything but simply just contacting Uber eats to get a refund"
"5.0","Chevere has become Arepittas... but I beg you:What's in a name? That which we call an arepa by any other name would taste as delicious!This place is a family business. It is run by what seems to be a few generations of people and all of them give you that family vibe. They probably yell at one another and there is probably some older woman in the back smacking people upside the head when they step out of line. As I said in a previous review on Chevere... do one thing and do it well. They do that! Are the empanadas greasy finger food? yes of course! Are all empanada's greasy finger food? YUP. This place was my first foray into arepas and damn am I hooked! They've got the real coca-cola here, which pairs just beautifully with a hangover and some Venezuelan food. Honestly this place may be the key to curing your work week hangovers. Just make sure you ask for some home made hot sauce/salsa. It's the icing on the cake, err the sauce on the empanada. The staff is so friendly and welcoming and helpful. I feel patronizing family owned and small business is one of the most important things we can do. If you've never had Venezuelan food, than why not give this spot a try. If you are downtown and looking for something quick and delicious? Why not pop in to this little shop strangely located under a parking garage on Cherry way.They offer arepas, empanadas, tacos, salads, and there's sides too. Cash only. Great combo options. Great value for your money. Sure this isn't dirt cheap. Because this isn't your local taco bell-pizza hut, but the ingredients are fresh and tasty, unlike some drive thru fast food spot. Get in there, get some delicious, and tell all your friends!"
"5.0","Great saison!  Very cool vibe, plus outdoor seating. Friendly service. We didn't eat, but the menu looks interesting and unique."
"5.0","Yum.  Went here because it was open late, and the menu sounded good - so glad we did.  Elegant late night feel and the food was delicious.  I don't live here, but if I did I'd visit regularly."
"5.0","Location sucks.. it's pretty hidden but the food is top 3 for Chinese restaurants downtown. They're always pleasant when I pick my food up (I go on my lunch breaks) and everything I order is delicious, every time. Giving 5 stars"
"4.0","My boyfriend and I's favorite pizza place re-did their menu and no longer has pizza. Saddened, we went on a search for a new go-to place and were very happy to find Beta Bites. I called and ordered a large pizza (wow, was it large!) and while the delivery did take a while, it was well worth the wait and understandable as it was prime Oakland dinner time. I had ordered roasted red peppers and they called back to tell me they were out of them and offered for me to pick two toppings for the price of one to make up for it. So nice!After reading the reviews though, I'll have to rethink just considering this a pizza place. All of the sandwiches and Moroccan inspired dishes sound great right now. I do have a question for the owner though, and seeing that he often replies, I'm hoping he can answer. I see that you have a Groupon offer. Is this valid for takeout? I often have friends over to my home for dinner and would like to use the Groupon to order takeout for us instead of cooking :) I just want to make sure that the limitation isn't for dine-in only. Thanks!"
"5.0","My friend and I visited here before a Bucco game on a Wednesday night.  This was my fourth or fifth visit.  On Wednesday's they have All You Can Eat Wings for 9.99.  We opted for the wings.  Your initial order has 10 wings, then refills come in groups of five.  Redbeards has between 10-15 different wing sauces.The wings were excellent!  Perfectly cooked, ample sauce on the weeks.  I had the buffalo garlic and cajun wings.  Refills came out in a reasonable time.  To top it off, we frequented during happy hour so 3.00 domestic drafts among other well drink/wine specials.We sat at the bar.  Bartender was friendly, everything seemed very clean and ample TV's.  I will definitely return before Bucco games in the future and hopefully it will be on a Wednesday!  Keep up the good work."
"3.0","Actually, for a Panera, this was quite nice.I was at the Petersen Event Center and this was a quick walk down the hill....idiot me never realized I'd eventually have to go back up the hill.The restaurant is huge...they must have room to seat 300 people, and every visit it's always been packed.Surprisingly, this Panera, for its location has a decent staff.  They're quick and they prepare their easily prepared national chain foods quickly.Personal pet peeve that Panera's are Pepsi establishments but soda and pop are bad for you and I shouldn't drink it anyways."
"5.0","Really enjoyed the chicharrones and the Scotch Egg I had here. The chicharrones were just so flavorful and the scotch egg was cooked to perfection. My server was very knowledgeable, and I am not the biggest beer person so I got the rum punch which was very good."
"4.0","Tasty Chikn.  The chicken sandwich with the slaw was very good.  Ordered the mild since they warn you about the medium being hot.  The mild was good with some heat and gave it the Nashville Hot flavor.  Had a side of Mac & Cheese that was highly recommended and found it to be better than most places with a good cheese flavor and the noodles were not overcooked."
"4.0","How have I not reviewed Salem's yet?  This place is great.  Falafel sandwiches are always good.  (Ask for hot sauce on it.  You won't be disappointed.)  All of the gyros and shawarma are very good except the chicken - tends to have too many chewy bits (i.e., gristle).  I've had their shish kebab once, and it was mouthwateringly delicious, and their appetizers are outstanding: baba ganoush, hummous, tabbouleh.  You can easily make a great picnic with a few of these.  (I've done it before.)The desserts are good, but nothing really special, for a Middle Eastern deli.  (Always a good selection, though.)Service is always friendly, but a little spotty on procedure.  Sometimes I feel like I'm being asked impatiently for my order when I'm obviously still deciding, and sometimes I feel like I stand there for a couple of minutes before someone helps me.  I feel guilty for being critical, though, because they are very friendly.Decor leaves a lot to be desired: just an enormous linoleum an drop-ceiling cavern with a few Steelers pictures on the wall.  (Bonus points for the garish, though colorful and friendly, murals on all of the exterior walls, though.)  Parking's a bonus, too: they have a small private lot that relieves the on-street parking, so they're one of the rare Strip denizens that doesn't require a parking space hunt."
"2.0","We stopped here after a Pirates game last night. We chose it because it wasn't busy - we should have heeded the warning!I thought we couldn't go wrong with a restaurant in downtown Pittsburgh because most everything we had was so good. Well this place was so bad. The only reason they get two stars is because they were friendly and it was clean. But that's as far as the 'good' goes. We ordered some pretty basic stuff, and it took quite a long time to receive even though they were not busy. Taco salad - chicken was very dry and tasteless, the rest was just boringSoup of the day - this was described as tomato soup with meatballs, 'like Italian wedding soup but with a red sauce'. All four of us are willing to bet money it was a can of spaghetti-Os!French onion soup - also tasted cannedI rarely give bad reviews. But I would have liked to have known myself how bad this was. And the kicker is, it was expensive. SighLive and learn"
"5.0","Cafe Raymond is in the heart of the strip districtA great alternative to Pamela's Why ? Because the ordering seating process is easy peasy and yumYou order at the counter get a number find a table sit relax and soon your food is thereThey have have blueberry ricotta pancakes light and fluffy come with real maple syrup my favorite of their breakfast offerings.There are egg Sammies and classic egg offeringsMy friend raves about their Rubin Says it's the best Rubin in the burgh I've ordered it with out meat Raymond's was very accommodating my non meat rubin was delish (ok its a grilled cheese with sauerkraut and Russian dressing) it really hit my Sammie craving that day.Salads and Sammies make for a perfect lunchThere are beautiful pastry and brownies for you to order. Fresh There is self serve water Everyone is always friendly Depending on time and day parking can be a hassle that's just the way it is in this neighborhood but Raymond's is worth finding that spot"
"5.0","Awesome beer! We love sours and they had some really great ones.. We didn't try the food but would next time"
"1.0","I would have given this place 5 stars because I really loved the atmosphere, drinks and their food, however the waitress named Melissa was extremely rude. She kept pushing my friends and I around the bar instead of walking by and saying 'excuse me' like any other service person in the service industry would. The bar tenders and bar backs were very nice and and even though the place was packed they still offered great service and were pretty fast at getting everyone their drink."
"3.0","If not for the great cocktails, this place would be a bummer. I was not too impressed during a recent Saturday evening visit here for some dinner and drinks. The place is extremely casual and the music is way too loud but most of the patrons were under 25 so I guess it fits the clientele.The drinks were very good and I would definitely recommend the old fashioned as it was made with great ingredients. The bartenders knew what they were doing on the cocktail side but that is about all this place did well. We ordered dinner as well and the tacos ($12) didn't have much flavor, the lamb curry ($14) was lacking lamb but still costs the same price as if it did have lamb(?), and the burger ($14) was probably the best thing that we tried. In addition to the average food, there was a weird exchange from the bartenders when they poured my dad the wrong beer. When he asked if it was the one he ordered, they poured him a sample of the one he said he wanted and told him to tell them if they were different. After he told them they were, they got upset before asking again which one he wanted. They eventually got him the one he wanted but the two in question were not the same.Overall, this place was average. It is definitely a kid hangout that doesn't need to worry about having good food as most people were only there for the drinks. Call me an old man but even with the windows and doors open, this place was extremely too loud. I'm glad I came here but I can't say I would recommend it."
"5.0","This is by far the best Thai food in Pittsburgh! Great prices, big portions and the ladies that work the front of the house are just lovely. I've tried quite a few things on the menu and have never disliked something. It's probably a good thing I don't live closer because I would be there at least twice a week! Keep up the good work, Thai Gourmet!"
"5.0","You get the value for your money, and more. The portion sizes are very generous, and you can make two meals out of one order. The food is not spicy as you would find in an Indian-Pakistani restaurant, but they can cook tandoori chicken for you.The staff is very friendly, caring, and quick with fulfilling your order. The only deductions is for lack of look, but if you are only interested in food, you will be in safe hands."
"5.0","Best place in Pittsburgh to stop in for the perfect cocktail or full meal. Always new items on the menu keep it fresh with experienced bartenders to allow you a great night out. Always taking friends and family here when it town. Always worth the visit!"
"5.0","Wow! What a truly awesome find in Pittsburgh. I have not had a burger this good in a while. I came here a couple weeks ago with my fiancé. We have passed by here multiple times on our way over to Lawrenceville. We decided to stop over because of all the great reviews we read. We started with a Strawberry milkshake and it was DELICIOUS. It just might be the best milkshake I've ever tasted. My only critique is I wish it could have been thicker. We got the pickle brined chicken for an appetizer. Both my fiancé and I loved this dish. We were very interested that the chicken was soaked in pickle juice. It was so moist and it melted in your mouth. It came with rum sauce (sounds weird) it was basically heaven. It's very hard to describe. Just take my word and try it! Both burgers were fantastic. So much flavor and were cooked to perfection. The Polish Hill burger was what my fiancé got and she loved it. A pierogi on a burger? Say no more, just order it. You won't be disappointed. If you're like me and love burgers, this place just might become your new favorite burger spot in Pittsburgh."
"5.0","I just ran across this place a few weeks ago and can't explain how pleased I am with my new find. As a fan or gyros, I can be picky about the ones I like; these ones are wonderful. For the type of job that I do, I travel all around Pittsburgh and I live finding places like this. This restaurant is a deli style, go up to the counter and wait at a table for your food type or restaurant. Though I only have tried the gyro combo (twice), I saw people ordering all kinds of other middle-eastern style foods, all of which look incredible. Two thumbs up, I'll be back."
"4.0","Recommend by several senior student of mine in CMU, finally I came here today for my dear friends birthday. Food in here really amazing and served very fast. Associates in Pamela's also very kind and sweet. But they only receive cash no credit card such a pity.  Love this dinning experience and will come back very soon :D"
"5.0","This place is quite small, and I didn't expect much coming in. But the food tho... OMG... so good! I ordered the dino bowl and my friend ordered a taco. He finished it in 4 min and bought another one  If you are in town, you should definitely come here and try their Devine Tacossssss"
"5.0","6/4/2017: You never know when the last time to visit with someone will be. My co-worker and I ordered takeout here and it was delicious. The shrimp egg rolls were fat and delicious. The egg roll wrap was perfectly fried to a crisp. The vegetables were delicious. I also got a large order of BBQ ribs. They were delicious too and the sauce was sweet and also delicious. I liked this place so much I'm planning to take out again tomorrow eve bc parking is free after 6 PM. I plan to get (2) more egg rolls, chicken and broccoli, and General Tso w/ white meat  chicken. I will also try their tea.6/5/2017: I got General Tso Chicken yesterday.  It was very soupy.  I like my sauce thicker and sticky.  I also got Chicken and Broccoli.  I liked it bc it had watercress.  I got (2) Chicken Egg Rolls.  They were okay, but I prefer the shrimp.  It was nice bc parking is free after 6PM.  4/18/2018. Tax day is over!  I'm going to reward myself with some shrimp egg rolls.  The crispness and sweet flavor are delicious."
"5.0","A Millvale treasure. I'm always curious as to how / why this delicious fast food eatery exist in our little town. I mean. There's literally no other Hardee's in the greater Pittsburgh area. Like. Why is it there? Is it part of some greater conspiracy? Who knows. Breakfast sandwiches are litttttttt"
"4.0","I liked the vibe of this place! But there is a long wait due to having to order and pay in line BEFORE you are seated or served. Pros:-food is delicious! The blueberry pancake is very fluffy and one of the best pancakes I've ever had-super friendly staff. Everyone stopped by to say hi to my baby and wave to her-hot sauce and napkins at each table! The Pittsburgh hot sauce was hilarious to readCons:-portions are really small for the price. Hubby got the lox platter and it was sparse. He had to eat at one of the other food stalls in order to be full. While that pancake was delicious, you only get ONE if you order the Guy's breakfast! No toast either and only ONE sausage patty. -long wait to order and long wait for food. There were plenty of empty tables around us and I saw some people who came after us getting food earlier but that might be due to what they ordered. Anyways, it was like a close 20 min wait for our brunch dishes-cramped settings and sticky, wobbly tables"
"4.0","Great pizza for the price. Their sicilian is awesome - thick, just enough sauce... So good!"
"5.0","I am here every Saturday morning following my espresso at La Prima. Ray has done such a great job creating place where there is always a place to sit, a staff wanting to help and serve you and delicious food to eat. In regards to breakfast I used to get the blueberry ricotta pancakes which are so good. However, lately I started getting the lox platter. Ray cures the salmon himself and it is so well done. Paired with the great ciabatta bread and toppings - you can't beat it. Also, do not forget the freshly squeezed orange juice too! I enjoy building my own, but if you would rather they have it already to go in sandwich form. If you would like to keep it more traditional, the sausage, egg and cheese on the croissant is always a good call."
"1.0","Decent food, incredibly unprofessional service. Placed a take-out pizza order this past weekend. Arrived to pick it up at the designated time. Person at the counter looked at me like they had no idea what I was talking about. Proceeded to locate my order ticket and THEN just start making my pizzas while I stood there. No explanation, no apology, nothing. But, it was obvious that they hadn't even started making the pizzas.A few minutes later, two of the employees behind the counter get into a shouting argument. one points at ME and tells the other one 'YOU SHOULD BE YELLING AT THAT GUY.'No idea what that was about, but it was completely unacceptable. I had no interaction with either of those clowns. Nobody made any effort to ask whether everything was OK, apologize for me having to wait, or make an excuse for the shouting match that went on behind the counter.The food isn't SO amazing as to make that behavior acceptable. Your mileage may vary, maybe I caught them on an off night, but there are literally a dozen other pizza places within 5 minutes of Rialto, so won't be going back."
"5.0","The Summit is totally bomb. I can't believe it took me this long to find out about it. The happy hour is simply too good to be true. Less than $6 for high end craft cocktails?! Manhattans are to die for, almost as good as mine at home. Just kidding, way better because I didn't have to make it. Luxardo cherries and all!The rest of the cocktail menu was fantastic as well. Combine this joint with a meal at Altius and you will have a night to remember in/on Mt. Washington. Highly recommend!!"
"1.0","I think I can safely say this is the worst Indian Food in Pittsburgh. They do a good lunch business with the Hospital, mostly visitors who don't know better, but they do have their fans. The decor is outdated and dirty, and the meat quality leaves much to be desired."
"2.0","Not quite sure how this happened or is possible, but my crepe was served with Velveeta 'cheese'.Moment of silence. : /Also, I was given a smuckers grape jelly plastic container. Besides that the food was actually pretty good."
"5.0","Ruth's Chris. Morton's. Capital Grille. They all have reasons be your favorite steakhouse. I'm a Capital Grille guy. The only better steak I've had was at the Benjamin in NYC. The experience is smooth, warm, clubby, not pretentious at all. It's pricey, but worth it. Have whatever you like. It'll be great."
"5.0","Stopped in for breakfast. The owner was very helpful and friendly in explaining the food. She's clearly passionate about her food and keeping in the tradition of her home. Great food and experience. We'll definitely come back."
"5.0","Fresh cooked authentic tacos right on the sidewalk, you can't get any better than this! I'm from Texas and my husband is Hispanic, so he can vouch for me when I say they are legit! Delicious!"
"5.0","This was such a delicious brunch. A small place with a cozy feel, cute decor and great food. Everyone at my table enjoyed their meals.  I had a bacon egg and avocado bagel and was super satisfied. Friends got a specialty crepe and an omelet. They also were accommodating for my friend who is lactose intolerant. Quick service, definitely recommend."
"5.0","Unbelievable food and service! Bring the checkbook though, but it's worth every penny!!"
"5.0","Sausalido is a well kept secret on the main strip through Bloomfield. It doesn't get the attention of the new and trendy places opening up in the area, but is easily the equal. The food is rich and flavorful. On recent trips I have had the Duck Breast, Crab Cakes and Squash Lasagne. Each was cooked perfectly, and the portions were very large. Also, you get a very rustic serving of bread with a white bean, gouda and balsamic dip. This is insanely addictive, You could almost eat that as a meal itself. The staff could not be more friendly. Cheerful, attentive and talkative, It's almost like having a family meal. The real gem here though is Chef Mike Smith. He is as affable as he is talented. He makes it a point to come out of the kitchen and talk and greet his guests. The place is BYOB, which is fine, though the corking fee seems a bit excessive. Otherwise, I've had nothing but extremely positive experiences here."
"5.0","I am always up for trying new Asian restaurants and I can honestly say Umami did not disappoint. First, I would like to point out that if you are not into climbing 3 flights of stairs this may not be the place for you. These stairs are STEEP and after a few drinks it could get dangerous. It isn't a very large place and I could see it filling up rather fast around dinner time. My friend and I arrived around 4:15 and we were the first ones there. They have high top table seating only, so if you are not into that this also may not be the place for you. For our drinks we ordered the tickle n giggle. Which is basically a Japanese take on a mojito. I personally wouldn't get this drink again, but it seems to be pretty popular here. The menu is izakaya style, so you order little bits at a time. I highly recommend the robatayaki. I ordered the pork belly and beef tenderloin. Both were glazed with tare, which is like a sweet soy sauce. I also ordered the Japanese fried chicken with gravy. This was probably my least favorite out of everything we ordered, but I still enjoyed it very much. They give you a lot of chicken for it being small bites. My friend and I shared the pork and shrimp shumai, which is an open faced dumpling. There was a total of 6 dumplings and each were stuffed very generously with pork, edamame and shrimp. The next dish we shared was the yaki udon. This came with egg, mushroom dashi, shiitake mushrooms, scallion, and barrel aged soy. The udon noodles were cooked just right and all of the flavors melded together perfectly.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to try Japanese street food. It is totally worth every penny for the amount of food you get."
"5.0","LOVE this place. Their Japanese 'street food' is as authentic as you can get in Pittsburgh! Would recommend ordering lots of things to share since there are so many good options. Their kitchen is OPEN UNTIL 2AM on Fridays & Saturdays!! Great for grabbing some drinks and Japanese bar food late at night. They have a bunch of Japanese inspired cocktails, as well as a range of cheap to expensive sake. Definitely a place you're going to want to come back to so you can try everything!"
"5.0","This place is amazing. I can't believe that I somehow went to the market and missed the entire restaurant and HUGE dining area just next door. The market has everything you need--- produce, frozen foods, canned and dry goods, and a great selection of fresh meats. I got the marinated lamb and chicken skewers that we grilled up and they were absolutely delicious. Just next door, there is a huge cafeteria-style restaurant that I can't wait to try again. Fast service with a very friendly staff. A huge group of us went so I was able to try a little bit of everything and it was all delicious. Gyros, kebabs, wraps, curry dishes and more. Great hummus and baklava! The food is high quality, generous portions and at a great price!"
"4.0","I am a big fan of Doce Taqueria. It's a simple operation that provides good, quality, affordable, and quick food. Tacos. *they do have a couple other options, but for Pete's sake, it's a Taqueria. $3 gets you a taco! I usually get 3 (my wife gets 2). They have chicken, beef, carnitas (pork), and veggie options. And they all have fresh toppings with a choice of corn or flour tortillas.Get. The. Carnitas. They'll make you want to . . . Do-ce-do.  (Corn Torillas all day)Do they provide authentic Mexican tacos? It feels like it. There are very specific food carts I go to in our city to get the truly authentic Mexican taco experience, but I have to be honest...Doce keeps coming to mind.I do wonder what happens on the 12th visit. The inside is small but inviting. Bar-ish style seating. Day of the dead and generally bizarre decor that I like, right off of E Carson. In the Southside and need a quality bite? Need to move quick? Need to take it to go or to sit in? Need a 12pm lunch spot. I mean...Doce makes it obvious! Eat there."
"5.0","Made to order kebabs. Hot, flavorful food. BIG portions. Salem's Market and Grill is a great find in the Pittsburgh Strip District if you are looking from something different. Personally I'm sad I haven't been here sooner! The grill area is counter service. You order with one person and pay at the counter. They will give you a number once the food is ready. Depending what you order it might take 10-15 minutes.We went on a Tuesday evening and it was PACKED. Worth the wait though. I've tried their shish lamb kebabs and the Kufta kebabs. The basmanti rice is fluffy and seasoned and comes with a side. It is enough food to split for two meals.Will be coming back again for sure."
"4.0","I really liked this place. The cooks were really friendly and the sandwiches were really tasty. It's a great place for some quick, tasty (but greasy) food. :)"
"3.0","I planned to have a birthday dinner at the restaurant as it came highly recommended. I was looking forward to the delicious food that I heard so much about. We started with amazing appetizers and a great server named Davin (sorry if it's spelled wrong). I ordered the calamari and a drink named Paloma. Others at the table got mozzarella sticks, crab cakes, and lobster bisque fries. They were all delicious. Then the Baja shrimp volcano came recommended by the manager named Ryan.  The food lived up to it's hype. We all enjoyed our food. Since it was my birthday I received a complimentary cheesecake. It was delicious. I thank you to the workers who did a phenomenal job caring for me and my friends.*Reason for 3 stars*Upon leaving the establishment we were greeted by Mr. Robert Wholey. There were racial comments said that made me and my company feel very uncomfortable.  It's a shame good food went to waste. I will not recommend anyone to go here if these are the ideals that are upheld."
"5.0","Visiting with my boyfriend for the Stanley Cup Finals game and came here - cute and quiet place - sushi is AMAZING! We live in Florida and eat ALOT of sushi and this was definitely in our top 5 favorites"
"4.0","One of my favorite cafes with an outdoor seating area. The view of the adjacent gardens was beautiful. The staff was friendly and we were served our food quickly. I enjoyed the apple havarti panini with fruit salad. All the food is super fresh and flavorful."
"5.0","Let me just warn you now, this place is crazy spicy. I went in thinking I can handle a fair amount of spice and ordered the medium sandwich, boy was I wrong! Bf also ordered medium tenders which were also super spicy. However, once the pain goes away, the chicken was very flavorful. I also recommend getting the macaroni and cheese as a side. Sides and a drink are a little extra and aren't included. I think we're just gonna stick to mild the next time we're here."
"4.0","Bar review: Basically, the kind of bar you'd expect in a bowling alley, with some craft beer options. Well + mixers were strong, served in a cheapest plastic cup, came with limes that were at least 2 days old and picked out of a styrofoam cup with fingers, and were $4. Then round 2 was served by grabbing that plastic cup back and refilling. All coordinated by a burly gentleman you can only assume is a lifer with little patience for the bullshit and whimsy of the gentrifying downtown crew. On another day, I'd be giving a horrified 1 star review. On this day, we really needed the break from gastropubs and overpriced bourbon."
"2.0","My first time experience at this place was just not that great. Huge line to one small elevator to get up to 3rd floor. When you get up to the rooftop, the view is nothing spectacular. You are looking at an apartment building and the walls of other buildings. I guess it's good if you just want to have the feeling of being outside. We looked around and saw reserved signs on lot of tables but there where some without the signs so we set down and waited for the waitress to show up. The place was busy but it definitely had lot of open tables. Our waitress told us that we are not aloud to seat ourself, so we had to go back to register to get a table. I was not happy about that, hence all the open tables nobody was using. We had to go get our drinks at the bar and wait around another 10 minutes and then we were seated back at a table. Just seems a little weird rule for a bar."
"1.0","I sent my parents here for their 37th wedding anniversary dinner a few nights ago.  They came with a gift card that, for some reason, didn't work.  The gift card is good and I was just re-issued the card by darden.  Instead of trying to solve the issue and figure out a solution, the manager berated my parents and embarassed them in front of guests, showing a complete lack of class.  There are a lot of good steakhouses in Pittsburgh - spend your money somewhere that treats patrons with a bit more respect than this place."
"5.0","Great place. Don't be an ass like me and go straight for DAMN HOT. I proceeded to trip balls on a psychedelic level, full of regret and stomach cramps. No joke, this was the hottest thing I ever ate. Will return for more chicken, just down a peg or two on the hot scale."
"5.0","My husband and I had dinner here last night with our two year old daughter. Everything we tried was fabulous and our server Kelly was awesome! The meat blend for the burgers was the best we have ever tasted. My husband order The Liberty, but also added bacon. The ability to build your own burger or customize any of the existing sandwiches was a big plus. I had the pickle brined fried chicken sandwich - let me just say OMG - so tasty!! My daughter had the mac-in-cheese (we helped her finish it) and it was the cheesiest. We started with the everything bagel hot dogs and while they weren't exactly what we expected - they had great flavor and I would highly recommend you give them a try. Great beer menu as well - Monkey Boy paired well with our meal. LV needed a great burger spot and this place definitely fits the bill!!"
